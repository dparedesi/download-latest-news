Time Published: 2024-12-03T16:39:00Z

Amazon Web Services (AMZN+2.20%) unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence training chip that it says is faster and expected to use less energy. Trainium3 is the first chip from AWS built with the 3-nanometer process — so far the most advanced semiconductor technology — that allows for better performance and power efficiency. The first Trainium3 chips are expected to be available late next year, AWS announced at its re:Invent conference on Tuesday. UltraServers powered with Trainium3 are expected to perform four times better than those powered by its Trainium2 chips, AWS said, “allowing customers to iterate even faster when building models and deliver superior real-time performance when deploying them.” The cloud giant’s Trainium2 chips, which are four times faster than its predecessor, are now generally available, AWS said. The Trainium2-powered Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances allow for 30% to 40% better price performance than current chips, and feature 16 Trainium2 chips. The new Amazon EC2 instances are “ideal for training and deploying LLMs with billions of parameters,” AWS said. The cloud giant said it is building an EC2 UltraCluster of Trainium2-powered UltraServers with AI startup Anthropic called Project Rainier. In November, AWS announced it was following up a previous $4 billion investment in the AI startup with another $4 billion. In the next phase of the partnership, Anthropic will use AWS as its primary AI training partner. “Trainium2 is purpose built to support the largest, most cutting-edge generative AI workloads, for both training and inference, and to deliver the best price performance on AWS,” David Brown, vice president of Compute and Networking at AWS, said in a statement. “With models approaching trillions of parameters, we understand customers also need a novel approach to train and run these massive workloads. New Trn2 UltraServers offer the fastest training and inference performance on AWS and help organizations of all sizes to train and deploy the world’s largest models faster and at a lower cost.” AWS chief executive Matt Garman also announced the next-generation P6 family of instances from Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%) and AWS, featuring the chipmaker’s new Blackwell chips. Blackwell has 2.5 times faster compute than current generation of graphics processing units, or GPUs, Garman said.

Title: Ex-Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger may get more than $10 million in severance pay

Time Published: 2024-12-03T16:26:00Z
Full Content:
Outgoing Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is set to get paid as much as $10 million as he exits the struggling tech giant. Gelsinger will receive 18 months of his base annual salary of $1.25 million, or $1.8 million, and 1.5 times his target bonus of $3.4 million, or $5.16 million, which will be paid out over the next 18 months, Intel (INTC-2.36%) said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Gelsinger will also receive a payment equal to 11/12ths of his 2024 bonus — which is subject to company performance — that he would have received had he not resigned. That would be a little more than $3 million. His departure comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%) in the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest, including a potential takeover bid, as its performance has lagged. In early November, Intel was kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average to make room for Nvidia, which has been hailed as an “AI darling.” Intel’s stock has fallen by more than 52% in 2024 as of Tuesday, while its rival’s stock has surged by more than 188%. Although Gelsinger’s resignation was announced Monday morning, it came after what CNBC reports was a contentious board meeting over a lack of confidence in the CEO’s plans to compete with Nvidia. Gelsinger had served as the company’s first chief technical officer before leaving the company. He returned in 2021 to take over for then-CEO Bob Swan in an attempt to stabilize and modernize the company. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” he said.

Title: Ex-Dividend Reminder: NVIDIA, Qualcomm And NXP Semiconductors

On 12/5/24, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and NXP Semiconductors will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. NVIDIA will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.01 on 12/27/24, Qualcomm will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.85 on 12/19/24, and NXP Semiconductors will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.014 on 1/8/25. Start slideshow: 10 Stocks Where Yields Got More Juicy » As a percentage of NVDA's recent stock price of $138.63, this dividend works out to approximately 0.01%, so look for shares of NVIDIA to trade 0.01% lower — all else being equal — when NVDA shares open for trading on 12/5/24. Similarly, investors should look for QCOM to open 0.52% lower in price and for NXPI to open 0.43% lower, all else being equal. Below are dividend history charts for NVDA, QCOM, and NXPI, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. NVIDIA: NVDA Qualcomm: QCOM NXP Semiconductors: NXPI In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.03% for NVIDIA, 2.09% for Qualcomm, and 1.74% for NXP Semiconductors. Free Report: Top 8%+ Dividends (paid monthly) In Tuesday trading, NVIDIA shares are currently up about 0.3%, Qualcomm shares are up about 2.8%, and NXP Semiconductors shares are up about 1.9% on the day.

Title: Collect 12% Yields By Investing Like A Billionaire In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/12/03/collect-12-yields-by-investing-like-a-billionaire-in-2025/

If you’ve been investing for a while, you’ve probably thought about private equity more than once. Adding exposure to “PE” firms, which buy and sell privately held businesses, is a great way to diversify beyond the big names of the S&P 500. But of course, to get in on that action, we have to be either institutional investors or have a net worth high enough to be “accredited.” Most people stop there. But there is a way to access private equity through a kind of lesser-known “back door.” For example, you could buy an ETF like the Invesco Global Listed Private Equity ETF (PSP) right on the stock market. The fund holds publicly traded PE firms like Blackstone, KKR & Co. (KKR) and the Carlyle Group (CG). It’s also had a pretty decent run, with a 9.1% annualized return over the last decade. More recently, though, PSP’s returns have been a bit weaker, reflecting a PE market recovering from its overvaluation in 2021. PSP Total Returns Ycharts However, private equity is recovering in 2024, with a year-to-date return above 25% both for PSP and the index on which it’s based: the S&P Global Listed Private Equity Index. That makes now an interesting time to invest in the PE space. But we can do better than PSP and its 2.9% yield (an annualized calculation based on the fund’s latest quarterly distribution) with the double-digit yielders I’ll show you in a bit. Doing so means we can use the higher cash flow to pay our bills and become more financially independent, of course. But a large income stream has a different function when it comes to private equity. Since this market can be highly volatile, a high dividend ensures we’re getting more of our return in cash, and at regular intervals. We can then either use these funds to diversify away from private equity or buy more at a bargain when the market turns against these assets. This is better than what most people do: Sell a bigger portion of their low-yielding “regular” stocks to generate cash. Trouble is, it’s easy to give in to emotion and do this more during bear markets, when it’s the worst time to do so financially. With that in mind, there are two closed-end funds (CEFs) with big parts of their portfolios in private equity that are compelling here: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ), which yields 13% as I write this, and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), with a 12.1% yield. BIGZ has about a quarter of its assets in private equity, and BSTZ is closer to a third. Both funds mainly focus the rest of their holdings on tech companies, like NVIDIA (NVDA) and chipmaker Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), that are themselves exposed to private firms through their vendors and customers. This diversification has helped both funds recover strongly since the 2022 selloff, with the last year showing particularly strong returns for BSTZ (in purple below). That’s partly because it devotes more of its portfolio to private equity. BSTZ/BIGZ Total Returns Ycharts In total, BIGZ’s private equity investments have seen a 44.1% decrease in their value on average, since the fund’s inception in 2021 (you can see a breakdown of the performance of BIGZ’s PE holdings and those of BSTZ here, on pages 9 and 14, respectively). This also explains why BIGZ trades at a 10.2% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio) today. Management is just not doing the best job on the PE side. BSTZ, meantime, has had a positive 30.9% return on its PE investments, but that’s going back to late 2019, since the fund is older. This is clearly much better, which explains why BSTZ’s discount to NAV is much smaller than that of BIGZ, at 7.3%. Plus, BSTZ’s 12.1% dividend gives you more control over your investment than you’d have if you just bought PSP, the private-equity ETF we mentioned earlier. Plus—and this is the real key here—BSTZ’s performance is getting better over time as the PE market recovers, which may be why the CEF (in orange below) has been outrunning PSP lately: BSTZ Outperforms Ycharts That makes BSTZ the best buy here—not just for the PE exposure and the 12.1% income stream, but also because we can still get in at a decent discount as private equity continues to recover.

Title: An Intel Break-Up Could Follow Its CEO Shake-Up, Bank of America Says

Intel (INTC) could break up its operations after CEO Pat Gelsinger's sudden retirement was announced Monday, according to Bank of America analysts. The analysts wrote Monday that Intel's internal manufacturing business and the foundry business that makes chips for other companies are now more likely to be separated, as the outgoing CEO was a proponent of keeping them together. Such a shake-up would still face a number of hurdles, like the strings attached to the nearly $8 billion in federal CHIPS Act funding announced last week. The BofA analysts said that the funding agreement dictates that Intel needs to retain at least a 35% stake in its foundry business. "Both businesses are undergoing their own strategic, structural, financial, and competitive issues, with no near term solution in sight," the analysts wrote, maintaining their "underperform" rating and $21 price target on the shares. Intel's stock finished Monday slightly lower. While Intel shares have lost more than half their value since the start of the year, some of the company's few bright spots have come from reports of potential investments or acquisition offers, or after the chipmaker sold pieces of some assets. Bloomberg and Reuters reported Monday that Gelsinger met with the chipmaker's board last week over its concerns about the company's turnaround effort and its progress in catching up to competitors like Nvidia (NVDA)—and allegedly was given the choice to retire or be fired.

Title: AI Is All Picks And Shovels, No Gold

Time Published: 2024-12-02T20:53:57Z

When it comes to AI you may be better off betting on the the suppliers—the “pick and shovel” ... [+] providers. Nvidia has become a household word these days. As a holder since 2015, I have experienced the growth stages of the stock—along with the sell offs—for almost ten years. Some of those stages were short lived—like the crypto mining rush and the gaming rush. Today’s almost universal worshipping of the company has a very different tone though. There are few investors taking the other side of this trade. Here are some of my concerns: This last point troubles me the most. Why are investors so enchanted by AI? AI has seduced investors, companies and curious onlookers with its potential to reshape industries. From IBM’s Watson to ChatGPT’s ability to mimic human conversation, we’ve come a long way in “narrow AI” advancements. These narrow successes pave the way for dreams of “general AI”—a system that truly mimics human intelligence. But the road from wishful innovation to transformative reality has yet to be constructed. We should expect AI advances to show up in repetitive tasks, call centers and other low-level functions. But we should be careful thinking that AI will advance beyond that. Why is that? Despite its early wins, AI still trails behind in the simplest of human tasks. It can play chess, write college admissions essays and solve complicated equations but ask it to play charades or navigate a tumbleweed on the highway and you’ll be very disappointed. Computers excel in training and processing unimaginable amounts of data. But intelligence that rivals the human brain—running on 0.3 kWh and the size of two fists—is still a distant dream. Investors have largely ignored this observation. While “breakthroughs” dominate headlines, the underlying theoretical progress remains slow. Theorists are leading the way, questioning fundamental approaches, while experimentalists—the coders—tinker with existing frameworks. But you can’t invest in theorists. Investors have worked around this by identifying other ways to invest. Last year, two paths emerged: bet on the builders (companies creating AI products) or the suppliers (the “pick and shovel” providers). Mark Twain famously quipped, “When everyone is looking for gold, it’s a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.” Nvidia, as a supplier of GPUs, has become a cornerstone of AI infrastructure. So far with Big Tech spending at an all-time high—fueled by a fear of being left behind—the pick-and-shovel approach has been paying dividends. But I don’t think this trend can continue indefinitely. At its core, AI today is more artificial than intelligent. While the technology marches forward, human common sense—embedded in our brains, shaped by bodies and honed through experience—remains far out of reach. The AI gold rush may continue for now, but savvy investors will look beyond the glitter to the tools fueling the frenzy. Here are two early warning signals I have used as AI sell triggers: DeepSouth and other inventions might be that better mousetrap. Yet hardly anyone is considering this possibility. If DeepSouth’s pending demonstration is successful it could shift all business away from Nvidia in a short time. It could transform the entire industry and produce many casualties. Regarding the Great Enlightenment, a few analysts are beginning to ask about the buildout and timing of possible dividends. So I think the dawn of the Great Enlightenment—that forces a reevaluation of today’s runaway spending—has begun. AI-related stocks are riding high, but a large selloff could be on the horizon as the Great Enlightenment and Better Mousetrap gain momentum. While riding the AI wave has been exciting and profitable, it may be time to consider stepping off the surfboard. Disclosure: Andersen Capital owns the referenced stocks in this article.

The Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) partner will replace its CFO in line with improvements in governance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Initiated after auditor Ernst & Young resignation for governance and internal control issues, the special committee's review found no need for financial restatements. Since then, Super Micro has hired BDO USA as its new auditor and sent Nasdaq a compliance report meant to stop delisting. Over three months, the assessment turned significant procedural flaws but no proof supporting Ernst & Young's claims. Former vice president of finance Kenneth Cheung has been appointed chief accounting officer per committee recommendations. To improve governance, the business intends to name a new general counsel, chief compliance officer, and chief financial officer. Super Micro does not plan to restate financial reporting for fiscal year 2024 or other years; it intends to achieve Nasdaq's listing criteria within the discretionary time. Super Micro has been especially close to Nvidia, incorporating its GPUs into its server systems to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning uses.

Title: Intel’s Turnaround CEO Pat Gelsinger Steps Down, Ending a Long Tenure at the Chipmaker

After nearly four years of attempting to turn around Intel’s struggling semiconductor business, Pat Gelsinger is out as the company’s CEO. His resignation ends a tenure marked by plunging profits and a failure to capitalize on the A.I. boom that lifted rivals like Nvidia. “We know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” said Frank Yeary, a longtime Intel board member who will act as its interim executive chair in light of Gelsinger’s departure, in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel.” Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Gelsinger, 63, stepped down as CEO and left Intel’s board effective yesterday (Dec. 1), the chipmaker announced today in a press release. David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, two senior Intel executives, will act as co-CEOs while the company’s board works to find a permanent successor. Zinsner is currently the company’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, while Holthaus has been appointed to the newly created position of head of Intel Products and will oversee its client computing, data center and A.I., and network groups. Intel shares rose 4 percent today in response to the news. The resignation caps more than 30 years at Intel for Gelsinger, who first joined the company as a teenager in 1979 and went on to become its first chief technology officer at the turn of the century before leaving Intel in 2009. After taking a senior position at the tech company EMC and serving as the CEO of the cloud computing player VMware, Gelsinger in 2021 returned to Intel to take over from then-CEO Bob Swan. Despite ambitions to regain Intel’s leadership in the semiconductor industry, the company in recent years has failed to catch up with competitors and has seen its share price plunge by about 50 percent in 2024 alone. At the center of Gelsinger’s turnaround plan was a strategy to branch into contract manufacturing to compete with rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a major supplier to U.S. chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD) and Qualcomm. In the meantime, the company has also pivoted to making A.I. accelerators to compete with industry leaders like Nvidia, but with little success—Intel’s current market cap is only 3 percent of Nvidia’s. Intel is one of the largest beneficiaries of the Biden administration’s Chips and Science Act, which is awarding the company nearly $7.9 billion in federal grants to expand its domestic manufacturing network—about a quarter of Intel’s cost of goods sold in 2023. Gelsinger’s ousting also came amid rumblings of activist investor interest in Intel. The company, which in October reported its largest-ever quarterly loss of $16.6 billion, reportedly tapped advisors like Morgan Stanley (MS) earlier this year to defend itself from activist pressure. “Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,” said Gelsinger in a statement. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

The tech-driven Nasdaq reached a high on Monday, driven by gains by Intel and Tesla (TSLA+1.74%), getting December off to a good start after a November that was the best month of 2024 for both the Dow and S&P 500. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.25%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.27% and the Nasdaq climbed 1%. This week, investors will see a diverse range of earnings reports from tech, meme stock, and entertainment companies. Salesforce (CRM+11.12% is set to release its earnings report Tuesday after the market closes. GameStop (GME-1.42%), a popular meme stock, will also report earnings Wednesday, and Lululemon (LULU+0.48%), which has been facing challenges due to sluggish sales, will report its earnings Thursday after the closing bell. In addition, the November jobs report will be released later this week. Shares of Intel (INTC-2.36% jumped 5% as the company announced Monday that CEO Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chip-maker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors such as Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%) amid the artificial intelligence boom. Tesla shares rose 3% after Roth MKM upgraded the stock from “Neutral” to “Buy,” setting a price target of $380 (up from $85). The firm cited the potential impact of CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with President-elect Donald Trump as a catalyst for the upgrade, suggesting it could bolster Tesla’s prospects in the coming months. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+3.98%) soared 23% on Monday morning following the announcement that an independent special committee had concluded its investigation into the company’s operations and found no evidence of misconduct by the company’s management or board of directors. –Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

(INTC, Financials) announced that co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus would succeed Pat Gelsinger, who will retire on Dec. 1. Gelsinger also left Intel's board. INTC stock is up 4% in Monday morning trading following the news. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MU. Holthaus will also assume the newly established Intel Products CEO post. Frank Yeary is designated temporary executive chair. Intel is trying to become more competitive in semiconductor production and negotiate continuous obstacles, including pressure on its foundry operations, hence the leadership transition comes as natural. Previously running Intel's Client Computing Group, Holthaus will concentrate on centralizing resources for the product group. Joined Intel in 2022 Zinsner, a former executive vice president and CFO of Micron Technology (MU, Financials). KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts said that the action would show Intel's readiness to sell its foundry business, a prospect considered positive by some investors. Analyzers also pointed out the difficulties in selecting a leader suited to handle Intel's wide-ranging problems. Intel has had challenges growing its foundry operations to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM, Financials) and understood pressure from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD, Financials) and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA, Financials) in artificial intelligence. Aiming to save $10 billion in expenses and simplify operations, the business announced in August a 15% personnel cut. Intel reported a net loss of $0.46 per share in the most recent quarter as income dropped 6.2% year over year to $13.28 billion. Foundry income fell 8% to $4.4 billion during the same time frame. Part of its cost-cutting initiatives, the corporation also noted a $2.8 billion restructuring expense. Under the CHIPs Act, Intel this week earned a $7.86 billion grant, a drop from an earlier $8.5 billion allocation to improve manufacturing headquartered in the United States.

Intel (INTC-2.36%) shares climbed by over 4% during mid-day trading on Monday after the company announced that its chief executive is out. After over four decades at the chip pioneer, Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger retired from the company and stepped down from its board of directors on Sunday, Intel said. Intel chief financial officer David Zinsner and chief executive of Intel Products Michelle Johnston Holthaus will now serve as interim co-CEOs while Intel’s board looks for another leader. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board, will become its interim executive chair. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. Intel’s shares, which have fallen over 47% so far this year, were up by about 4.4% amid the news, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM+0.88%) U.S.-listed shares were up by almost 5%, and British chip designer Arm’s (ARM+0.61%) shares were up by 4.5%. Gelsinger’s stepping down comes as the chipmaker loses ground to competitors including Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%), which has benefitted from the artificial intelligence boom. In late November, the U.S. Commerce Department finalized Intel’s Chips Act funding of up to $7.86 billion — less than the proposed $8.5 billion announced in March. However, the finalized direct funding is in addition to a $3 billion contract Intel was awarded under a part of the Chips Act known as the Secure Enclave. The program is meant to expand manufacturing of cutting-edge chips for the U.S. government. With its Chips Act funding, Intel plans to expand its U.S. semiconductor industry footprint with chipmaking and advanced packaging sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon — an investment worth more than $100 billion. Meanwhile, Intel was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November and replaced by Nvidia. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) announced Monday that CEO Pat Gelsinger retired effective Dec. 1 and stepped down from the company's board of directors. Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. Intel stock was up roughly 5% on the news midday before reversing direction. Shares fell as much as 2% in afternoon trading. A person familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance that the board had lost confidence in Gelsinger and a change was needed ahead of 2025. The person added the decision was made by a small group of people inside Intel, and the leadership team was only made aware Sunday afternoon. It's unclear if Intel will continue with Gelsinger's expensive expansion into making chips for other companies, the source said. Intel has named CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs. Holthaus was also named Intel Products CEO. The company said its board has formed a search committee and “will work diligently and expeditiously to find a permanent successor to Gelsinger.” “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Intel's board chair Frank Yeary said in a statement. Intel is facing two separate lawsuits filed this year by investors claiming they were misled about the company's financial performance. The latest was filed by a pension fund in August following the chipmaker's announcement that it would slash 15,000 jobs. Gelsinger had previously spent 30 years at Intel but left in 2009. He rejoined the company in 2021, taking over the role of chief executive from Bob Swan. Gelsinger promised that his tenure would bring back a “Grovian” mindset to the company and right years of missteps that saw Intel lose its edge in the chip market to artificial intelligence chip design leader Nvidia (NVDA) and chip manufacturing giant TSMC (TSM). That goal referred to former CEO Andy Grove, who oversaw a spectacular turnaround for the company in the 1980s when Intel struggled to maintain its dominance in the memory chip market amid competition from Japan — and made a dramatic shift toward producing another kind of chip, called CPUs, of which it became the leading manufacturer. Many of the problems facing Intel predate Gelsinger's tenure and will remain a challenge for its next leadership group. Intel is grappling with a slump in PC chip sales that’s only just beginning to improve and increased competition in that market from AMD (AMD) and British chip designer Arm (ARM), all while the CPU market as a whole is threatened by the rise of GPU chips, which are used to run generative artificial intelligence — a market dominated by Nvidia. As Intel CEO, Gelsinger sought to bolster the company's foundry business by making chips for external customers. Intel makes its own chips but had never produced semiconductors for external customers, and its own chipmaking processes faced delays beginning in the mid-2010s. Gelsinger undertook aggressive efforts to improve Intel's manufacturing processes — which he outlined at the start of his time as CEO in 2021 — that aimed to reverse the foundry's former failures in five years. Intel has recently focused on upgrading to a manufacturing process called 18A that would allow it to directly compete with TSMC as a producer of AI chips. Gelsinger's departure casts doubt on the company's focus on its service foundry, which could affect Intel's ability to catch up in the AI space, according to analysts. "[W]hile keeping [the foundries] feels like deadweight (and a continuation of the strategy that got Pat out), scrapping them would also be fraught with difficulties around the product roadmap, outsourcing strategy, CHIPS act, and political navigation," Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a client note Monday. In late November, Intel was officially awarded $7.86 billion in CHIPS Act funding for its semiconductor manufacturing and packaging operations in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. The company also recently announced plans to split its foundry business into an independent subsidiary, and Gelsinger's exit could accelerate that change, according to Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri. The move toward Intel's money-losing chip manufacturing business has so far failed to bolster faith in the company. Intel has recently become a takeover target, and shares of the company are down more than 50% for the year. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 26%. Intel stock was recently replaced by Nvidia in the Dow. As Bernstein's Rasgon wrote, "There don’t seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the slot looks in for a tough ride."

Manage your account Intel (INTC) announced Monday that chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA) amid the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest — including a potential takeover bid — as its performance continues to lag. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” Yeary said. Intel stock was up about 4% in pre-market trading on Monday. The company’s shares have shed roughly 50% of their value so far this year. Gelsinger returned to Intel as CEO in 2021, replacing Bob Swan, to help modernize — and stabilize — the company, to little avail. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. The company has taken several measures to kickstart its sputtering performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. As part of the restructuring plan, Intel took a $2.8 billion charge in the third quarter. The company saw a 6% year-over-year decline in revenues in the three months ended Sept. 28, for a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Nvidia continues to be the runaway leader in chips used for artificial intelligence (AI). The company's leading position in the data center market has driven triple-digit revenue growth over the last few years. Nvidia is now one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a $3.4 trillion market cap at present.

Intel (INTC-2.36%) announced Monday that chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger is retiring from the company and has stepped down from its board of directors. The move comes as the chipmaker struggles to keep pace with massive competitors like Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%) amid the artificial intelligence boom. In recent months, Intel has also been the subject of activist investor interest — including a potential takeover bid — as its performance continues to lag. As the board searches for a new chief, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant named David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEOs. Frank Yeary, the independent chair of Intel’s board and its interim executive chair, said the pair will continue the company’s mission to simplify and strengthen Intel’s product portfolio and advance manufacturing and foundry capabilities while cutting costs. “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Yeary said in a statement. “We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,” Yeary said. Intel stock was up about 4% in pre-market trading on Monday. The company’s shares have shed roughly 50% of their value so far this year. Gelsinger returned to Intel as CEO in 2021, replacing Bob Swan, to help modernize — and stabilize — the company, to little avail. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,” Gelsinger said in a statement Monday. The company has taken several measures to kickstart its sputtering performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. As part of the restructuring plan, Intel took a $2.8 billion charge in the third quarter. The company saw a 6% year-over-year decline in revenues in the three months ended Sept. 28, for a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA-0.77%). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers.

Billionaire Jeff Bezos is throwing his weight behind a computing company that’s coming for Nvidia’s (NVDA+3.44%) dominance of the artificial intelligence chip market. Bezos Expeditions, the Amazon (AMZN+2.20%) founder’s private investment vehicle, was part of a $693 million funding round for Tenstorrent, the company announced Monday. He joined LG Electronics and Fidelity in the round led by South Korean firms Samsung Securities and AFW Partners. “We are excited by the breadth of investors that believe in our vision,” Keith Witek, the chief operating officer of Tenstorrent, in a statement. “If you look at this group, you see a balance of financial investors and strategic investors, as well as some notable individuals that have conviction in our plans for AI.” Tenstorrent said it will use the money to “build out open-source AI software stacks, hire developers, expand its global development and design centers, and build systems and clouds for AI developers.” The company has strived to provide more accessible and affordable solutions for companies looking to develop their AI capabilities, putting itself in direct competition with fellow Santa Clara, California-based firm Nvidia. So far, it has signed about $150 million in contracts, Tenstorrent said. Currently the second-most valuable company in the world behind Apple (AAPL+0.13%), Nvidia is a Wall Street powerhouse and a behemoth in the AI chip space. Last month, it reported $35.1 billion in revenues for its fiscal third quarter, with 36% of that revenue — or $12.6 billion — coming from only three unnamed customers. Those sales are primarily attributable to Nvidia’s Compute & Networking segment, according to filing. Although Nvidia will not disclose the customers, its top buyers are likely to include Google (GOOGL+1.75%) parent Alphabet, Meta (META+0.01%), Microsoft (MSFT+1.45%), and Tesla (TSLA+1.74%) — all of whom are major players in the AI boom. But smaller companies are struggling to build up their AI capabilities as Big Tech firms corner the market — and power-hungry AI chips remain prohibitively expensive. That’s where Tenstorrent is hoping to come in. Founder and CEO Jim Keller told Bloomberg that Tenstorrent uses open-source and commonplace technology to provide engineering solutions that put AI in reach for more firms, and skips costly and complex parts, including like high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used by Nvidia. “You can’t beat Nvidia if you use HBM, because Nvidia buys the most HBM and has a cost advantage,” Keller said. “But they’ll never be able to bring the price down the way HBM is built into their products and their sockets.” Open-source technology has become increasingly popular amid the AI boom, given its cost effectiveness. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the company’s first open-source, multimodal large language model, Llama 3.2, will be the way forward. “It’s sort of like the Linux of AI, and we’re seeing closed-source labs react by trying to slash their prices to compete with Llama,” he said at Meta’s annual Connect conference in September. Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI also made its chatbot, Grok-1, an open-source model. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

BlackRock said Tuesday that the transaction includes equity issued by a subsidiary, and that the equity can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis into BlackRock common stock. The company said the transaction creates an integrated private credit franchise with approximately $220 billion in client assets. (Reuters) -Despite widespread concern that generative AI could interfere with major elections around the globe this year, the technology had limited impact across Meta Platforms' apps, the tech company said on Tuesday. Coordinated networks of accounts seeking to spread propaganda or false content largely failed to build a significant audience on Facebook and Instagram or use AI effectively, Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, told a press briefing. The volume of AI-generated misinformation was low and Meta was able to quickly label or remove the content, he said. Gelsinger is also eligible for his annual bonus for the 11 months he served as CEO in 2024, bringing the total to about $12 million, according to a Reuters calculation. Gelsinger was forced out less than four years after taking the helm of the company, handing control to two lieutenants as Intel searches for a permanent replacement. Gelsinger, who resigned on Dec. 1, left after a board meeting last week during which directors felt his costly and ambitious turnaround plan was not working. Citi analyst Gustavo Schroden downgraded Nu Holdings (NU) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $11, down from $14.60. The company has shown an “impressive capacity” to expand its operations in Brazil rapidly, while maintaining even faster net income growth, the analyst tells investors in a research note.

With shares up by a whopping 179% year to date, Nvidia has been one of 2024's top performers as it continues to dominate the generative artificial intelligence (AI) industry. Revenue jumped 94% to $35.1 billion, driven by continued demand for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to run and train AI algorithms.

The company's leading position in the data center market has driven triple-digit revenue growth over the last few years. Nvidia is now one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a $3.4 trillion market cap at present. Relatively few investors will buy Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) class A shares as 2024 draws to a close. There's a good reason why: The cost of one class A share of Berkshire Hathaway tops $715,000. Here are three reasons to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock like there's no tomorrow.

The bull market looks to be in full force as valuations continue to rise higher for many stocks. Three of these hot stocks that investors should be extra careful about these days are MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). Although they have generated some fantastic returns for investors, you may want to consider taking a second look at these stocks before deciding to invest in them, as their valuations are at absurdly high levels. Elon Musk is on another level this year. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO added $119 billion to his fortune in 2024. This pushed his net worth to $348 billion. That's not just a number. It's more than the entire net worth of tech icon Michael Dell. Let that sink in. Musk isn't alone in raking it in, though.

Expecting Nvidia stock to replicate its eye-popping performance over the coming decade looks like a far-fetched idea, considering that the size of the global economy is expected to hit $110 trillion this year.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 9 Trending AI Stocks On Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. xAI founder Elon Musk has raised billions in funding for his AI startup in the past few months. Recent comments from the eccentric billionaire suggest that he is planning to launch an AI-powered gaming studio through xAI that will rival the game studios that are owned by massive corporations. He made the remarks in a post on social networking platform X. The startup has ballooned in valuation over the past few years. The Grok developer recently raised $5 billion in new funding, bringing the valuation of the startup to $50 billion, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Just like xAI, other AI startups are also turning heads in the venture capital world. For example, tech news platform TechCrunch reports that Pathway, an AI startup, just raised a $10 million Seed round to build live AI systems that, the company claims, think and learn in real-time as humans do. Per the report, the Pathway offering includes what it calls infrastructure components that power live AI systems, feeding on structured and unstructured data, meaning that enterprise AI platforms can make decisions on up-to-date knowledge.

Latest reports, published by tech news platform TechRadar, contend that the chipmaker will reveal the RTX 5090 cards at the CES 2025 show in January. Per the report, the AI-capable RTX 5090 cards would be a GPU targeted at professionals, rather than PC gamers, to justify a possible price hike. The RTX 5090 will reportedly feature a 22.2% increase in die size over the RTX 4090, which translates to better performance but a heftier price tag. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. Nvidia (NVDA) announced its new AI audio model, Fugatto, this week that can generate or transform “any mix of music, voices and sounds described with prompts using any combination of text and audio files.” Fugatto is short for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1, Nvidia said. With the new model, users can enter a text prompt and generate a music snippet, remove or add instruments to an already existing song, change accents or emotions in a voice, and “produce sounds never heard before.” “Fugatto is the first foundational generative AI model that showcases emergent properties — capabilities that arise from the interaction of its various trained abilities — and the ability to combine free-form instructions,” Nvidia said. Anthropic announced new updates to its Claude AI chatbot this week. With the new Google (GOOGL) Docs integration, Claude can use context from a user’s documents to improve the relevance and accuracy of its responses, Anthropic said. Claude can summarize long documents and “reference historical context” from Google Docs files. The integration is available for Claude Pro, Team, and Enterprise users. Claude’s new styles feature allows users to customize how the chatbot responds to follow a preferred communication style and work requirements. Users can choose a formal, concise, or explanatory style. Claude can also generate custom styles from uploaded sample content. Anthropic also added the ability to add global profile preferences for the chatbot to instruct it “on things you always want it to keep in mind,” such as a preferred coding language. AI agents startup /dev/agents came out of stealth mode this week and announced a $56 million seed round. The funding round was co-led by Index Ventures and CapitalG. The startup, which is building an operating system for AI agents, was founded by former Stripe chief technology officer David Singleton, and former vice presidents at Google and Meta (META): Hugo Barra, Ficus Kirkpatrick, and Nicholas Jitkoff. “Today you can build an AI demo in hours, but getting something consumers can actually trust with their credit card is nearly impossible,” Singleton said. “Just as Android made mobile development accessible to virtually any developer, we’re building the platform that will help make AI agents mainstream.” Runway announced its new base model for image generation, Frames, this week. The new model represents “a big step forward in stylistic control and visual fidelity,” the AI startup, which develops multimodal AI systems for video, image, and audio generation, said. Frames can maintain stylistic consistency when generating images, Runway said. Access to Frames is rolling out in its Gen-3 Alpha foundation model and through Runway’s API. Visual AI platform Luma launched its first image generation model, Luma AI Photon Image Model, this week. The text-to-image foundation model was built on Luma’s Universal Transformer architecture. The model is 800% faster and cheaper than other models, Luma said. Luma also announced a free and subscription-based service for its Dream Machine visual AI service on the web and iOS. The Dream Machine model was released in June and has 25 million registered users.
