The Dow Jones gained more than 1500 points on Wednesday after Trump won the 270 electoral votes needed to become the 47th President of the United States, and the volume was twice the normal level. By Friday, as shown in the table, all four major indexes closed at all-time record highs. That says something about Wall Street’s view of which candidate’s economic policies were better for long-term economic growth. As of the close of business on Friday (November 8th), for the week, the major indexes are up in the 5%-6% range with the small cap Russell 2000 up more than 8.5%. For that small cap index, the YTD change is just 9%, so almost all of its year-to-date gain came this week! Equity Markets The Magnificent 7 (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, TSLA, GOOG) have also been hot this week with three (NVDA, AMZN, and TSLA) setting new all-time highs, Nvidia and Amazon on Thursday (11/7/24) and Tesla on Friday. Magnificent 7 Prior to the election, markets had been flat. This can be traced to the disappointing guidance from Microsoft and Meta. Apparently, the markets feel confident that President-elect Trump’s economic policies will be positive for U.S. businesses. For example, his stated tariff policy would make it easier for U.S. made goods to compete with foreign imports, especially those from China, many of which are subsidized by the Chinese government. Here is a comparison of some key market and economic data from 2016 (when Trump’s first Presidential term began) to today. Data comparison of Trump's first Presidential term and today Of note, these critical ratios are much more constraining now than they were back in 2016. For example, the debt/GDP ratio of 123% may act as a constraint on Trump’s ambitions. Of concern is the debt servicing cost. If this pierces 30%, the costs of Treasury debt will rise significantly, and there could be more rating agency downgrades. The fact that the Republicans control the Senate and are likely to control the House of Representatives, would, in the past, indicate a more conservative approach to spending and deficits. That hasn’t been the case of late. We’ll see what happens with this Congress. The large fiscal deficits during periods of healthy economic growth has a two-fold negative impact: 1) A rising Debt/GDP ratio has consequences for interest rates (i.e., higher than they otherwise would be) with debt servicing costs set to become a major fiscal headache; 2) A rising Debt/GDP ratio could be a threat to the dollar’s world reserve currency status, a status that keeps demand for dollars and Treasury securities high. A loss of such status would surely raise the cost of U.S. Treasury borrowing. We came across the chart below from the folks at Y-Charts that shows the S&P 500 performance under the 12 U.S. Presidents since 1960. For 10 of the 12, the S&P 500 was higher at the end of their terms than at the beginning. Only under Presidents Nixon and G. W. Bush was the S&P 500 lower at the end of their tenure than it was at the beginning. As noted above, the financial markets have high hopes for a second Trump term. S&P 500 performance under the 12 U.S. Presidents since 1960 On Thursday (November 7th), the Fed lowered the Fed Funds Rate by 25 basis points (0.25 percentage points) to 4.50%-4.75%, a move that was widely anticipated by the markets. Of interest was Chairman Powell’s response at the press conference to a question regarding the +2.7% year/year inflation rate as calculated using the Personal Consumption Expenditure Index (PCE), the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Powell’s response was to refer the audience to the six-month and three-month annualized rates. Both of these are well below the 2% Fed target. That was quite a dovish response. (We note here that in past blogs we have referred to the much lower annualized rates in the three- and six-month indexes; giving us confidence that we would be seeing much lower rates of inflation going forward.) Also of interest was Powell’s comment that “the labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressure,” indicating that there are signs of labor market softening emerging in the data. Again, we have noted such in our past blogs. The surprise of the press conference occurred when Powell was asked if he would step down if asked to do so by President-elect Trump. His response was a short one-word answer with an irritated tone: “NO!” Later in the press conference he indicated that, because the Fed is independent from the Federal Government, under the law, the President could not remove him or any of the other Fed Governors. Note: His term expires in May 2026. We don’t see this as a big deal. This Powell led Fed had already embarked on an easing cycle in September, well before the election. Given the duration of business cycles, the Fed isn’t likely to raise rates again during the remainder of Powell’s term. So, the only likely point of disagreement between Powell and Trump can only be the speed at which the Fed lowers those rates. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) showed up at -0.5% in September from their August reading. This is the 7th consecutive negative reading. The Index is down -4.8% from a year earlier, and as shown on the chart, that year/year percentage change hasn’t been positive since mid-2022. The Coincident Economic Indicators still showed up as positive (+1.4%), and while that means that the economy is still growing, the Leading Indicators are forecasting that the future road may be rocky. Here’s some food for thought: In January ’08, LEI was -4.9% year/year (quite similar to today’s -4.8%). The Coincident Indicator was +1.5% (again like today’s +1.4%). What happened next? The Great Recession! Further back, in February ’01, the LEI was -5.0% year/year, and the Coincident was +1.7%. Again, a Recession was not far off. Some economists want to write-off the predictive power of the LEI. We’re not in that camp. Let’s not forget the huge fiscal deficits have played a major role, and are likely the major reason why the economy remains in growth mode. As noted above, a continuation of such deficits endangers the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency. Leading Economic Indicators The left side of the chart shows the slowdown in Nonresidential Construction. It is rather dramatic with the year/year percentage change falling from more than 20% in 2023 to 5% late in 2024. On the residential side, the growth rate, which peaked in 2021 at over 30%, is now also at a 5% annual rate. While both are still positive, they reinforce our thesis that the economy’s growth rate is slowing. Construction Nonresidential and Residential Spending Since the end of September, interest rates have spiked (see chart). This was likely due to the +2.8% growth in GDP in Q3 and the Street’s expectation that such growth would continue. The labor market appears to be weakening, with payroll growth in the Non-Farm Payroll Survey in October at just +12K (and the Household Survey showed -368K with a falloff of -164K in Full-Time positions). Data shows that consumers spending growth has been far beyond their advancement in income. As Herb Stein famously remarked, “Something that cannot go on forever, won’t!” In the May to September period, income grew +1.1%, but spending grew far faster, at a +3.3% rate. The result has been a rapid drawdown in savings. That cannot continue for long. Consumption growth is likely to slow significantly in 2025 and we think that interest rates will come down by 2 percentage points or more, from a 4.5% Fed Funds rate today to the 2%-2.5% range in 2025-2026. 10 Year Treasury Yield From the rise to record levels in the equity markets this week, it is clear that Wall Street was happy with the results of the presidential election. It is also plausible that had Kamala Harris won, the financial markets could have performed similarly. After all, during President Biden’s term in office, stocks are up 50%. Perhaps the rise in the equity markets was just relief that there was a clear winner and that there won’t be days, weeks, or even months of uncertainty and ballot recounts. Also note that three of the Magnificent 7 (NVDA, AMZN, TSLA) also hit record highs this past week (ended November 8th). During President-elect Trump’s first term, the S&P 500 rose +67%. We presented a table that showed a comparison of significant economic indicators Then & Now. Given the much higher starting points in the Now column, especially the P/E ratio and the rising debt/GDP, a repeat of that 67% growth in the S&P 500 achieved in his first term appears to us to be much harder to achieve over the next four years. But, then again, who thought even a week ago that Mr. Trump would be re-elected so handily? Per market expectations, the Fed lowered interest rates by 25 basis points this past week. The tone of Fed Chair Powell’s press conference was on the dovish side, as the Fed sees inflation continuing to move to its 2% goal and whose attention is now focused on the labor market. Of interest was Powell’s response to a question regarding the +2.7% year/year PCE inflation rate. Powell’s response was that the six-month and three-month annualized rates were much lower. Quite the dovish response. We also now know that Mr. Powell will remain Chairman of the Fed at least through the end of his term (May ’26). Prior to the election, the Powell led Fed had already embarked on an easing cycle. That happened in September with the 50-basis point rate reduction. Given the duration of business cycles (measured in years), this Fed is unlikely to raise rates again during Powell’s remaining term. Meanwhile, the Leading Economic Indicators continue to forecast an economic slowdown (at a minimum), while the macroeconomic data coming from the government agencies mostly say that fairly robust economic growth will continue. We are of the belief that an economic slowdown is underway. We just don’t know yet if it will morph into a Recession. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.) One Community.

Title: What’s next for nuclear stocks after regulatory pushback?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nuclear energy stocks have become a favorite of Wall Street this year as the artificial intelligence boom spreads and Big Tech searches for ways to meet its growing power demand. They helped power the S&P 500’s Utilities index (XLU) to all-time highs — the index is on track to outperform the S&P 500's equal-weighted counterpart (^SPXEW) in 7 of the past 10 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And Vistra (VST), a nuclear power company, recently surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) year to date. Big Tech firms, including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG), drove the gains, announcing hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in nuclear power names over the course of several weeks. It’s a story the market ran with. Then came a regulatory wrist slap that briefly stopped the nuclear energy rally in its tracks. In a 2-to-1 ruling on Nov. 1, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a request from Talen Energy (TLN) to increase the power it could provide Amazon from its Susquehanna power plant, citing concerns about grid reliability and energy affordability. Several nuclear energy stocks, including Talen, Oklo (OKLO), Centrus Energy (LEU), Vistra (VST), and NuScale Power (SMR), tumbled the following Monday. Amazon is expected to petition the decision, according to CFRA analyst Daniel Rich. But for investors, “it certainly is a setback,” Rich said. Rich explained that co-location agreements have become a major focus for the tech industry, as they allow hyperscalers to buy power directly from an existing energy source for their data centers. This enables them to build more data centers at speed and at lower costs. But these agreements may be a sticking point for regulators, which is why Big Tech has pursued other strategies, such as creating new sources of nuclear energy through small modular reactors (SMRs). Though there are currently no SMRs in the United States, companies like Amazon see them as a way to affordably add to the power grid while also meeting the increased energy demands AI requires. "The order may not represent a long-term risk," ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox told Yahoo Finance. "It’s more that FERC may have punted or didn’t want to set a precedent about co-location until it had firm policy." Clay Sell, the CEO of nuclear reactor designer X-energy, told Yahoo Finance that “a significant portion of the increased electricity demand in the US for the next 25 years is going to come from AI.” “It could be as high as 10%, 20%,” Sell added. Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk also recently contextualized the amount of power the AI boom is going to require. His data shows that you’d have to add three New York Cities' worth of power to the grid by 2030 to meet the demand that is going to come from artificial intelligence. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) Tech companies see nuclear as a way to meet that demand. That may be one reason why Amazon is not done with co-location, telling Yahoo Finance via email that “we remain committed to continue innovating and advancing carbon-free energy solutions with companies like Talen Energy to power data center operations in the United States and the many technologies supporting our customers and our daily lives.” Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez also rebuffed regulators on his company's earnings call, which came one day after the ruling, saying, "Co-location in competitive markets remains one of the best ways for the US to quickly build the large data centers that are necessary to lead on AI." Despite beating on earnings and revenue, Constellation stock (CEG) fell after the company reported third quarter results due to fallout from the Talen news. But CFRA's Rich said Constellation is a stock to watch in nuclear. “I think Constellation is the most buyable dip," he said. "Constellation … is by far and away the largest nuclear operator, more than three times more megawatt capacity than the next competitor. And we think that in our view, nuclear is really one of the best ways to service this type of demand from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, [and Magnificent Seven] names that have large needs for power.” Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks capped their best week of the year on Friday after the S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly hit 6,000 in a market rally spurred by Donald Trump's White House victory followed by the Federal Reserve's latest rate cut. The broad-based index rose 0.4% to a new record, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed near the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6% after crossing 44,000 for the first time during the session. Stocks edged higher to end a stellar week of gains driven by optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's policies will boost the economy. The initial "Trump trade" rush was volatile on Friday as the US dollar (DX=F) and Treasury yields gave up a good chunk of their post-election gains. Even so, Wall Street major gauges notched fresh milestones during the session after racking up more records on Thursday as the Federal Reserve delivered the expected interest rate cut. Disappointment over China's new fiscal stimulus drew investor attention, putting pressure on Chinese stocks and oil prices. The $1.4 trillion plan to refinance local government debt left investors unconvinced of its potential to spur a faltering economy. In equities, AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) officially entered the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Tesla (TSLA) hit $1 trillion in market cap as shares of the electric vehicle giant soared more than 9%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped more than 10% after Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of his social media platform, Truth Social. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Stocks capped their best week in a year on Friday as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly touched the 6,000 mark and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) crossed 44,000 for the first time ever. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed just above the flat line. Friday's gains were a continuation of the monster rally this week spurred by Donald Trump's White House win on Wednesday. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) held above $76,000 ,while Tesla (TSLA) shares rose roughly 8% on Friday to extend gains of 30% for the week. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped 15% as Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. After a week of market highs on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win, investors can look forward to more economic data next week for clues on the health of the economy. The next monthly inflation read is scheduled for Wednesday before the market open. Economist expect the Consumer Price Index to have risen 2.6% on an annualized basis in September, with a rise of 0.2% from the prior month. Next week Wall Street will hear from more companies as they announce their quarterly results, including Live Nation (LYV), Spotify (SPOT), Home Depot (HD), and Hertz (HTZ). On Monday, Nov. 11, the stock market will be open but the bond market will be closed in observance of Veterans Day. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed out of negative territory to hit new intraday highs along with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Utilities (XLU) led the market gains along with Real Estate (XLRE) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) as Tesla (TSLA) shares gained more than 9% during the session. Tesla (TSLA) shares rose to a session high of 9% on Friday to hover near $325 each. The EV maker's market cap also climbed above $1 trillion. Tesla stock has soared more than 30% over the past week on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory as the company's CEO Elon Musk was one of Trump's biggest supporters. Tesla shares have rallied more than 30% in the past week. Stocks were on track for their best weekly gain this year as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hit the 6,000 mark on Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) crossed 44,000 on the heels of Donald Trump's White House win earlier this week, followed by Federal Reserve's latest rate cut. On Friday the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) wavered between positive and negative territory but if the tech-heavy index manages to close above the flatline, it will notch another record close. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), now a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, briefly touched a new high earlier in the session but later slipped below the flatline. Other notable movers touching all-time highs include the S&P 500's Industrials Sector ETF (XLI) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) stocks. Tesla's (TSLA) market cap rose above $1 trillion on Friday after shares of the EV maker touched 52-week highs. The stock has soared 30% over the past week on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly touched 6,000 for the first time ever on Friday as stocks head toward their best week in a year. The broad market index jumped more than 0.4% to new record highs after a monster rally this week on the heels of Donald Trump's White House win. The move higher also follows the Federal Reserve's latest decision to cut rates by 25 basis points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also climbed to new highs on Friday, surpassing the 44,000 level for the first time ever. Chip stocks initially soared on former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s win and the Fed’s latest rate cut. But they moved into the red Friday as analysts begin to contemplate uncertainty surrounding Trump’s approach to the chip sector as he returns to the White House in January. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) fell more than 1%, dragging the Nasdaq (^IXIC). Nvidia (NVDA) dropped 1.1%, Qualcomm (QCOM) fell 1.4%, Arm (ARM) sank 3.5% while AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron (MU) fell less than 1%. "Trump's victory brings further uncertainty to the semiconductor sector in terms of its impact on additional China restrictions, higher tariffs, and CHIPS Act funding. The industry is broadly braced for another round of restrictions on the supply of chips and equipment to China,” Jefferies (JEF) analysts wrote Friday. "Trump's win was clearly the key event this week, and many semiconductor stocks, esp semicaps, are likely to trade sideways till there is clarity on further restrictions, tariffs, and Chips Act funding," Jefferies said. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered near $76,000 on Friday as the risk-on rally post Donald Trump's White House win was on pace to end the week on a high note. The cryptocurrency spiked to new highs on Wednesday following the presidential election results. Trump was a supporter of bitcoin during his campaign, advocating for the creation of a national crypto stockpile if elected to the White House. Chinese stocks fell on Friday, dragging on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which hovered near the flatline. Disappointment over China's new fiscal stimulus sent shares of Chinese tech stocks lower. The recently announced $1.4 trillion plan to refinance local government debt left investors unconvinced of its potential to spur the economy. E-commerce and cloud giant Alibaba (BABA) fell nearly 6% while PDD Holdings (PDD) also dropped 6%. Earlier this week the sector fell over concerns of potential tariffs after Donald Trump won the presidential election. Airbnb (ABNB) shares fell nearly 10% Friday after posting mixed third quarter results. Quarterly earnings per share of $2.13 missed Wall Street’s forecast of $2.15, and revenue of $3.73 billion came in ahead of the $3.72 billion expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Bank of America (BAC) analyst Justin Post maintained his Neutral rating on the stock, raising his near-term estimates for bookings over the next year but lowering his 2025 earnings growth outlook. “While Airbnb is expanding its geographic reach, and has a number of new growth initiatives to help to capitalize on its large bookings ecosystem, core nights growth is in line with peers and the margin growth seems less likely in 2025,” Post said. He expects shares to rise to $154 over the next 12 months. The stock stood at roughly $133 Friday morning. JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth also has a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hitting $142 over the next year. Anmuth said in a note to investors Friday morning “Overall, we are encouraged by improving demand trends & ABNB’s early progress toward expanding beyond the core, but expect growth sustainability to remain the biggest pushback.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) soared to new intraday highs on Friday, crossing the 44,000 level. The blue-chip index was up nearly 0.7%, or about 290 points. Ironically, AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), which joined the Dow on Friday, was lower by about 1% during the session. The major average is up about 28% year to date. Tesla (TSLA) hit $1 trillion in market cap on Friday as shares of the electric vehicle giant soared as much as 7%. The stock has been on fire this week following Donald Trump's White House victory. CEO Elon Musk bet big on Trump, with more than $130 million in political support. The question for investors is whether the financial commitments will benefit Tesla. On Friday, Tesla shares were trading at their highest level since March 22. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped 10% and was briefly halted for volatility after Donald Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. Trump, who made the announcement on his Truth Social account, maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $30 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $6.5 billion, giving the president-elect a stake worth around $3.9 billion. Shares in the company have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. On Thursday, the stock fell nearly 23% to reverse the gains it enjoyed the day prior as Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. But with Friday's moves to the upside, the stock is down just 2% over the past five days, although shares have rallied by more than 60% in the past month. Read more here. Americans are feeling increasingly better about the short-term path for inflation. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed consumers expect inflation to sit at 2.6% in a year, a decrease from last month's expectation of 2.7%. November's reading is the lowest since December 2020 and is within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation did tick higher, though, rising to 3.1% from 3% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 73, up from 71 in October. Interviews for the survey concluded on Monday and therefore don't capture any reactions to election results. US stocks flirted with their record highs on Friday following the latest rate cut announced by the Federal Reserve. Market euphoria following a Trump White House victory seemed to drift as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was little changed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.3% On Thursday the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point cut, a move widely anticipated by the markets. And on Friday AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) replaced semiconductor giant Intel (INTC) as one of the Dow's 30 components. The new addition should give the blue-chip index an added boost. Intel shares are down roughly 45% year to date while Nvidia is up more than 200%. Paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW) also replaced Dow Inc. (DOW) as a component of the major average. Here’s a look at the key market themes as you wake up today: China’s stimulus falls short, Paramount misses earnings despite streaming growth, and Nvidia hits a $3.6 trillion market cap.

US stocks hovered near record highs on Friday, with the Nasdaq lagging as post-election euphoria ebbed and China's latest stimulus plan fell flat. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped roughly 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%. Stocks drifted higher to end to a stellar week of gains driven by optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's policies will boost the economy. But the initial "Trump trade" rush appears to be fizzling out as Wall Street questions whether Trump will be able to push through his ambitions policies. The dollar (DX=F) and Treasury yields, for instance, have given up many of their post-election gains. Disappointment over China's new fiscal stimulus also dampened market spirits, putting pressure on oil prices, the yuan and local stocks. The $1.4 trillion plan to refinance local government debt left investors unconvinced of its potential to spur a faltering economy. Even so, Wall Street major gauges are still on track for strong weekly wins after racking up more records on Thursday as the Federal Reserve delivered the expected interest-rate cut. The S&P 500 is closing in on crossing the 6,000 level for the first time. On the corporate front, Sony (SONY) shares popped in premarket trading after the PlayStation maker posted a 73% jump in quarterly profit.

Title: Stock market today: Fed cuts rates, Nasdaq surges as Nvidia and Amazon lead tech rally

US stocks held onto gains as investors digested a fresh interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and Donald Trump's electoral victory. In a widely expected move, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.3% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded right around the flat line, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. Spirits still appeared buoyant after Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. The Fed's interest rate decision later Thursday could be the next catalyst that moves markets. Aside from the rate cut, the focus is on what Chair Jerome Powell might reveal about the future path of policy, especially as Trump's return could mean rates stay higher for longer. On the corporate front, Arm Holdings (ARM) stock rose about 4% after amid a broader tech rally despite the chip designer's revenue forecast disappointing Wall Street's hopes for stronger, AI-powered growth. Peer Qualcomm's (QCOM) shares were near flat after its sales and profit outlooks topped estimates. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) continued to pull back from the big spike that followed the election result. Shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — fell by double digits during the session. The Fed's next policy decision is less than 30 minutes away. Here's a look at where markets sit before Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's closely followed press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.2% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Broadly, big tech led the market action with all of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks up more than 1% on the day, led by more than 3% pop in Meta (META). In bonds, a recent move higher in yields took a breather, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling about 7 basis points to 4.35%. Below is a look at the sector action for the day where Information Technology (XLK) is leading the way. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president. "They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down and not say anything all that new," said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust. Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one. Fed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes. And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, and those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions.

"Exuberance lies ahead," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday night. "President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response." Emanuel, who already had a 6,000 call on the S&P 500 for 2024, now sees the S&P 500 hitting 6,600 by the end of June 2025, about an 11% increase from its current level. A "public reengaged in speculation," as evidenced by Wednesday's market action with bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting 76,000 for the first time and Tesla (TSLA) stock soaring 14%, could help drive the benchmark index higher, per Emanuel.

The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.79% through Wednesday, up from 6.72% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. The average 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was essentially unchanged, to 6% from 5.99%. Mortgage rates typically mirror 10-year Treasury yields, which rose quickly in recent weeks as traders grew increasingly confident that former President Donald Trump would win Tuesday’s election and implement inflationary policies like tariffs. Read more here. About 24 hours after Donald Trump won the presidential election, American CEOs are already weighing on how the president-elect's policies could impact their business. For one, Trump's proposed increases on tariffs are expected to weigh on retailers. On Wednesday, Steve Madden (SHOO) CEO Edward Rosenfeld said his company has been “planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly.” “Our goal over the next year is to reduce that percentage of goods that we sourced from China by approximately 40% to 45%, which means that if we’re able to achieve that and we think we have the plan to do it, that a year from today, we would be looking at just over a quarter of our business that would be subject to potential tariffs on Chinese goods,” the shoemaker's CEO said. Trump's presidency is also expected to be less restrictive on mergers and acquisitions. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said Thursday Trump's second term could provide an opportunity for more consolidation in the media industry. "We have an upcoming new administration, and it's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different," Zaslav said on a call with analysts following the company's third quarter results. Raymond James analysts on Thursday downgraded shares of DHI (DHI), saying that in the wake of Trump's election win, they view mortgage rates staying “higher for longer” and constraining housing affordability. The investment firm downgraded DHI to Market Perform from Outperform but kept the same price target at $195.00. It lowered its fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates to $13.25 from $15.80 and projects an EPS estimate of $15.00 in the fiscal year of 2026. Due to “the near-term pressures we see on entry level homebuilders, whose core first-time buyers are likely to face even greater affordability challenges this spring,” Buck Horne, director at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a note to clients. "Coming out of a volatile October, DHI was already facing pressure from a more competitive inventory environment, rising rates, and buyers’ election anxiety,” Horne added. The bearish call comes as DHI reported weaker-than-expected home orders for its fiscal fourth quarter as high mortgage rates dampened buyer affordability. Netflix (NFLX) stock has surged to another all-time high as tech rallies after Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. The stock is currently trading above $790 a share and has climbed more than 60% since the start of the year, with 10% gains over the past month — far outpacing broader markets. The moves higher extend beyond the recent Trump-fueled rally, however, as Netflix stands out among a list of battered media sector names. The streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%. And in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close. Disney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks. "Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field," Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance. Read more about Netflix's dominance here and why analysts say it's won the hard-fought streaming wars. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared more than 25% after its third quarter earnings beat expectations. Lyft’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 were ahead of the $0.20 expected, while quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Rides for the period ended Sept. 30 totaled 217 million, above the 213 million expected. On Wednesday, Lyft announced partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies as it looks to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market, adding driverless cabs to its network in Atlanta in 2025. Wall Street analysts in notes to investors Thursday gave kudos to Lyft’s expansions beyond ride-hailing. “LYFT is no longer a ride-hailing pure-play with it now embarking on partnerships in food delivery and AVs,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst and Lyft bull Brad Erickson. Lyft recently unveiled a partnership with DoorDash (DASH). Still, analysts overall maintained Neutral ratings on the stock, with Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt, writing, “[W]e wait for clear evidence of a more sustainable growth trajectory for the business.” Lyft shares are up 74% from last year but far below highs in the $60 range in 2021. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly touched new highs just north of $76,000, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House win. The cryptocurrency jumped to new records on Wednesday and crypto-related stocks also rose following the presidential election results. Over the summer Trump promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world and form a 'strategic bitcoin stockpile.' Shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) each gained more than 1% on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House victory. Both stocks closed at all-time record highs on Wednesday. Earlier this week Nvidia surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as the largest company in the world. The artificial intelligence chipmaker is expected to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) on Friday, replacing semiconductor giant Intel (INTC). Meanwhile, Amazon stock has been in an upward trend after the company posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly result last week. On Thursday, shares were trading just above $210 each. Another batch of companies reported earnings Thursday morning. Moderna (MRNA) jumped 5% at the market open as its earnings beat expectations partly thanks to better-than-anticipated COVID vaccine sales. Warner Bros. (WBD) jumped 10% thanks to streaming growth as Max subscribers soared. Meanwhile, Hershey (HSY) fell more than 1% after sinking as much as 3% premarket as high cocoa prices cut into its sales outlook for the year. Here’s a closer look at how the companies performed: Hershey: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 vs. $2.56 per share expected, revenue of $2.99 billion vs. $3.07 billion expected Moderna: Earnings per share of $0.03 vs. a loss of $1.98 per share expected, revenue of $1.86 billion vs. $1.25 billion expected Warner Bros.: Adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 vs. a loss of $0.12 per share expected, revenue of $9.62 billion vs. $9.81 billion expected Meanwhile, energy companies traded flattish after showing mixed results as natural disasters impacted some of their businesses. Duke Energy (DUK) saw its profits hit by hurricane costs, while Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) missed on revenue just as it shut off power in Northern California amid fire risks. Nuclear power provider Vistra soared 11% after an earnings beat as it recovers from earlier losses. Stocks extended their gains on Thursday following a monster rally on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The move higher in stocks comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.5% after all three major averages closed at record highs on Wednesday. As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and avoid any unnecessary surprises after the election of Trump as the next president. Meanwhile, parts of the "Trump Trade" showed some signs of unwinding on Thursday as Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits, reversing the gains it enjoyed in the prior session. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits in premarket trading on Thursday, reversing the gains it enjoyed on Wednesday as Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. As Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal reports, shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. The stock is down about 10% over the past five days, although shares have rallied nearly 120% in the past month. Read more here. Initial jobless claims jumped to 221,000 last week, an increase of 3,000 from the previous week's revised level, according to data released by the US Department of Labor on Thursday morning. The previous week's level was revised up by 2,000 from 216,000 to 218,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims came in at 1,892,000, an increase of 39,000 from the previous week's revised level.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks stepped higher on Thursday, eyeing a return to the Trump rally as investors mapped out the next president's likely impact on markets and awaited the Federal Reserve's policy decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1%, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022.

His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. But some on Wall Street see signs of a relief rally, given Trump's decisive victory also put paid to worries about a contested vote. They suggest stock gains could slow as the euphoria fades. The Fed's interest-rate decision later Thursday — typically, a dominant event for markets — is taking something of a back seat amid the election fallout. For one thing, investors see a 25 basis point rate cut as pretty much a sure thing at the end of policymakers' two-day meeting. Instead, the focus is on what Chair Jerome Powell might reveal about the future path of policy, especially as Trump's return could mean rates stay higher for longer.

Title: Nvidia Stock Prices to Watch as AI Darling Becomes World's Most Valuable Company

Nvidia (NVDA) this week surged into the top position among the world's most valuable companies by market capitalization, surpassing iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). The AI chipmaker’s shares gained about 4% on Wednesday, hitting a record high of $146.49, as U.S. equities soared following the election of Donald Trump as president. Nvidia shares have risen nearly three-fold since the start of the year amid insatiable demand for the company’s family of AI chips, including its next generation Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs). Below, we analyze the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels that investors may be watching. Since breaking out from a symmetrical triangle last month, Nvidia shares have traded mostly sideways to higher as investors look for future catalysts that may drive the AI favorite’s next move. It’s worth pointing out that in recent months, the stock’s volume has tracked steadily lower, potentially indicating that larger market participants remained on the sidelines ahead of the US election and amid uncertainty over chip export curbs. Looking ahead, investors should monitor for increasing share turnover while eyeing these important price levels on Nvidia’s chart. The first lower level to watch sits at $144, an area on the chart just below Wednesday's closing price where the shares may encounter support near a period of consolidation positioned around the prior all-time high (ATH). Further selling could see Nvidia shares fall to around $125, an area on the chart where they currently find support near the closely watched 50-day moving average and symmetrical triangle’s upper trendline. A breakdown below this level could see the stock fall to the $97 region. Investors may seek entry points at this location near a trendline joining two March peaks with a series of prices positioned around the early-August low. To forecast a higher level using technical analysis, we can apply the measuring principle, often referred to as a measured move. This technique works by calculating the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near their widest point and adding that amount to the initial breakout area. In other words, we add $55 to $125, which projects an upside target of $180. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Title: Trump's election win could take the U.S.-China chip war to a new level

Time Published: 2024-11-06T22:25:00Z

Since President-elect Donald Trump’s first term in office, the U.S. has wielded its trade restriction and sanctioning powers in an effort to curb China’s technological advances. Now that he’s headed back to the White House, the semiconductor war between the U.S. and China could escalate. “If Trump ascends to the office, he’s already said in his campaign rhetoric that he’s going to double down and even make tariffs as well as export controls more severe,” Arthur Dong, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Quartz in a pre-election interview. Efforts to slow China’s advanced chipmaking abilities under Trump’s first presidential term were continued by the Biden administration. Earlier this year, the Biden administration was reportedly debating using an export control called the foreign direct product rule, which would impact companies in U.S. allies including Japan’s Tokyo Electron (TOELY) and Dutch chip machine-maker ASML (ASML). The rule does not allow the export of any good to any country if it is manufactured with a certain percentage of U.S. intellectual property components. It was later reported that some allies would be exempt if the rule is expanded. “He’s [Trump] likely to go further than the Biden administration has gone with regard to the imposition of blanket tariffs across a much wider variety of goods,” Dong said. Under Trump’s first administration, Chinese tech giant Huawei was placed on the U.S. Entity List in 2019 after the government determined it had “been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” Other Chinese semiconductor firms have been added to the list to restrict U.S. companies from sending equipment for advanced chip manufacturing. Trump extended the ban on Huawei’s products through 2021, and trade restrictions on it and other Chinese tech firms have only tightened under the Biden administration. Before the election, U.S.-based chip equipment makers were reportedly bracing for more export controls under the Biden administration, telling suppliers they worried about risking their vendor status for using certain components supplied by China. The companies also reportedly told suppliers not to have Chinese investors or shareholders. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” ASML chief executive Christophe Fouquet said in October. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” During his most recent campaign for the presidency, Trump said he would impose tariffs on chips from Taiwan, which could have a heavy impact on global chipmaking, as a majority of the world’s most advanced chips are fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). The Taiwanese-chipmaker counts Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) as major customers. In October, Trump accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry during an appearance on the The Joe Rogan Experience podcast — a point he also made in July during an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. In response to a question about supporting Taiwan against Chinese aggression, Trump said the island “took our chip business from us.” “I mean, how stupid are we,” Trump said. “They took all of our chip business. They’re immensely wealthy.” Instead, Trump said, Taiwan should be paying the U.S. to protect it. “I don’t think we’re any different from an insurance policy,” Trump told Bloomberg. “Why? Why are we doing this?” During his interview with Rogan, Trump also criticized the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed by the Biden administration in 2022 — partly to spur domestic advanced chip manufacturing. “That chip deal is so bad, we put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come and borrow the money and build chip companies here, and they’re not going to give us the good companies anyway,” Trump said on the podcast, adding that the U.S. should instead put tariffs on chips coming into the U.S. Over a dozen chipmakers, including U.S.-based Intel (INTC), Taiwan-based TSMC, and South Korea-based SK Hynix, are still awaiting billions of dollars in funding and loans from the U.S. CHIPS Act to build semiconductor hubs throughout the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Super Micro Computer stock bleeds 24% after it can’t even say when it will post actual earnings

Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) shares plummeted more than 24% on Wednesday after the AI hardware company released a disappointing preliminary first-quarter report and failed to confirm a timeline for its actual first-quarter results. The San Jose-based company, which missed the deadline for filing its annual report, is also facing a potential Nasdaq delisting. The company reported unaudited quarterly results on Tuesday after the market closed, leading to the sharp sell-off. This development follows the recent resignation of its auditor, Ernst & Young, which departed last week, citing disagreements over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. On Wednesday, the stock was trading near $21, marking a fresh 52-week low. Compared to its March peak of $123, the price has plunged over 82%, erasing over $55 billion in value. For the quarter ending September 30, Super Micro reported net sales between $5.9 billion and $6 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, which had forecasted $6.45 billion. The company’s forecast for the December quarter also fell short of expectations, and it projected revenue between $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion, which was below the consensus estimate of analysts of $6.86 billion. Additionally, Super Micro expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to range from 56 cents to 65 cents, while analysts had anticipated EPS of 83 cents. On Tuesday, the company made no mention of Ernst & Young’s departure or any ongoing corporate governance concerns. However, CEO Charles Liang did confirm that Super Micro is actively working to hire a new auditor. It’s important to note that the company has not reported audited financial results since May. Moreover, the company is facing potential delisting from the Nasdaq. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. The company makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI, and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. CEO Liang said on Tuesday that the company is working closely with Nvidia and that the demand is strong. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Google (GOOGL) parent company Alphabet’s shares were up over 3% after the market open, while Amazon (AMZN) shares were up over 2% — hitting a record intraday high since a peak in July. Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) shares rose minimally by around 1% and 0.2%, respectively. Meta (META) was the only Big Tech company to see its shares fall; they dropped around 1.3%.

The president-elect also said he would impose tariffs on Taiwan’s chips and called the Biden administration’s U.S. Chips and Science Act “so bad.” Intel (INTC), which is expecting the largest Chips Act package so far (almost $20 billion in funding and loans), saw its shares rise over 4% on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 1,300 points at the market open, while the S&P 500 index rose 1.9%, and Nasdaq futures were up 1.8%.

Stock futures surge after the election win by former President Donald Trump, as did with bitcoin, Trump Media (DJT), Tesla (TSLA) and the Russell 2000. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as the firms that hold them, all made strong upward moves in early trading; Super Micro Computer (SMCI) declined as it provided uncertainty on filing its report and delivered weak revenue; Novo Nordisk (NVO) moved higher after reporting strong sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug; Nvidia (NVDA) climbed to make it the world’s most valuable company, overtaking iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring after the presidential election victory for Republican Donald Trump, with premarket trading pushing Dow futures higher by about 3% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures up roughly 2%. Futures trading for the smaller-company focused Russell 2000 jumped by more than 6%. Shares of Trump Media (DJT) were up more than 30% and Tesla (TSLA) shares are up more than 12% in the premarket session. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 15 basis points to reach 4.45%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surged to a record high, briefly topping $75,000, on the Trump victory. Bitcoin was recently around $74,586, up about 8% over the past 24 hours, while the estimated total value of the crypto market was higher by a similar percentage. Shares of several bitcoin-related companies, including trading app Robinhood (HOOD), cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and Marathon Digital parent company MARA Holdings (MARA), surged 10% or more in premarket trading. Shares in Microstrategy (MSTR), a big holder of bitcoin, were 14% higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged premarket after the server maker said it couldn’t predict when it will file its delayed annual report for 2024. The company has been warned by Nasdaq about its requirements of “timely filing” of reports, giving it until Nov. 16 to issue its report or to submit a plan. The company reported preliminary quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ projections at $5.9 billion to $6 billion, down from the its previously guided range of $6 billion to $7 billion. Novo Nordisk (NVO) shares rose by about 3% premarket after the Danish drugmaker reported strong sales of its popular Wegovy weight-loss drug. Wegovy sales reached 17.3 billion Danish crowns, or $2.5 billion, in the third quarter, a jump of 48% from the prior quarter. For the nine-month period ended in September, the company reported a 21% increase in operating profit and a 31% increase in North American sales. Nvidia (NVDA) shares continued their climb in premarket trading, rising by a bit less than 1%, pushing its market capitalization to $3.43 trillion, higher than iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Apple’s shares edged higher in early trading, keeping its market capitalization at around $3.38 trillion. Nvidia had briefly overtaken Apple on Monday before moving higher again on Tuesday as demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips pushed the company’s share price higher. Microsoft (MSFT) is the only other company with a market cap above $3 trillion.

Title: What the Latest Dow Shakeup Could Mean

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This week, two new stocks are joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nvidia Inc (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW). The Dow is a widely followed index made up of the 30 biggest companies with a history dating back to the 1800’s. NVDA and SHW will be replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow Inc. (DOW) – no relation to the index. This week, I examine past changes to the Dow’s constituents and explore how the stocks tended to perform after being added or removed. I have a list of 26 stocks that have joined the Dow Industrials since 1997. I looked at how those stocks performed after officially being added to the index. The table below summarizes the returns. The second table is for comparison, and it shows what the returns looked like had you purchased the index instead of the individual stocks. The results are mixed. The stocks averaged an 8% return over the first three months after being added to the index with 65% of the returns being positive. However, a year after the additions, those same stocks were up just 1.74% on average, with less than half of the returns positive. Based on this, avoid NVDA and SHW and put that money in a Dow index fund. Purchasing the Dow Index rather than the stocks would have yielded a 7.45% return on average with 84% of returns positive over the next year. The last change to the Dow was earlier in February, when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). Since then, AMZN has gained over 12%, while WBA is down more than 50%. The table below shows the stocks added to the Dow since 2010. These stocks have fared better than the summarized table above but still, less than half have outperformed the index over the next six months and year. My list of stocks removed from the Dow is less than stocks added, because more of these companies have gone out of business or have been bought out. So perhaps we’re not getting the full picture. The 18 stocks I have data for have performed terribly, especially immediately after leaving the index. These stocks have averaged over an 8% loss over the next month of trading after leaving the index with only 17% being positive or beating the Dow Index. The six-month returns also underperform by a lot averaging a loss of 2.7% with 33% positive. Nine of the 18 stocks, however, have beaten The Dow over the next six months. Here’s the list of individual stocks removed from the index since 2010. These ten stocks show significant underperformance in the first month of trading, averaging a loss of 3.8% with just 30% positive and 30% beating the Dow Index. Over the longer term, the stocks eliminated from the index have done much better than stocks added. Over the next year, these stocks averaged an impressive 28% return with 67% of them beating the index. The stocks added to The Dow since 2010 have averaged a return of 6.3% with just 44% beating the Dow Index (see table above). One way to look at index changes, especially on such a popular index, is as a driver or indicator of sentiment. Stocks added to the blue-chip index could gin up some positive sentiment, while those eliminated might get the stocks off some people’s radars. I could argue the data above supports this interpretation. New stocks in the index underperformed and have been less likely to beat the index than those kicked out of the index. I’m focusing on the data since 2010. Based on the analysis, perhaps wait at least a month then take a look at the two stocks recently eliminated, INTC and SHW. Sign in to access your portfolio

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) will report quarterly earnings on Tuesday after market close, following a series of recent challenges. Most recently, the AI hardware company’s auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned over disagreements about Super Micro’s governance practices and board independence. Additionally, Super Micro is facing a potential delisting from the Nasdaq, having received a non-compliance letter in September. The company has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance — or risk being delisted for the second time in five years. Super Micro shares rose 1% to $26.25 on Tuesday afternoon, nearly 80% below their March peak of $123. The company announced a stock split earlier this year that was popular among investors. The company is set to report earnings on Tuesday for the fiscal quarter ending September 2024. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $0.75, up from $0.28 in the same quarter last year. In the previous quarter, Super Micro missed EPS expectations by $0.19, triggering a sharp drop in its share price the following day. Revenues are projected to reach $6.52 billion, representing a 207.5% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498.

Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Super Micro’s stock price took a significant hit following the accusations. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course.

Title: Nvidia and Apple keep taking turns at the top of the world

Nvidia (NVDA) is back on top as the world’s most valuable public company ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The chipmaker’s shares rose around 2.4% on Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.42 trillion and past Apple’s (AAPL) market cap of $3.37 trillion. The iPhone maker’s shares were up by around 0.4%. Apple was able to defend the top spot at the market close on Monday after Nvidia briefly took over earlier in the day. In late October, Nvidia briefly overtook Apple after a record-setting stock rally, but ended the day below the tech giant. Nvidia will take over Intel’s spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the end of the week. Nvidia passed both Apple and Microsoft (MSFT) for the first time in June to become the most valuable public company in the world. Earlier in the month, the chipmaker reached the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. It became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after it reported record fourth-quarter earnings in February. Nvidia’s South Korea-based chipmaking partner SK Hynix saw its shares surge on Monday after it said the U.S.-based chipmaker asked it to move supply of its next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips up by six months. The U.S. presidential election could have implications for Nvidia and other chipmakers which have come under tightening U.S. restrictions on selling to China under both the Trump and Biden administrations. In October, the head of Dutch chipmaking equipment company ASML (ASML) said he expects more pressure on U.S. allies to curb chip sales to China. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML, said. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” The U.S. finalized restrictions on investments in sensitive technologies in China by U.S. individuals and companies late last month. The rules cover three categories of technology: semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Some investments are banned, while others require notice to the U.S. government.

Title: University A.I. Programs See Massive Enrollment Surges Thanks to ChatGPT

In 2018, the University at Buffalo became one of the first schools in the world to establish a master’s program focused on A.I. The technology “wasn’t a big craze” at the time, Kemper Lewis, dean of the university’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, told Observer, with the program’s enrollment seen as “slow and steady for a little while.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The program is classified as a Master of Science in Engineering Science with a focus on A.I. and provides a foundational background in A.I. and relevant subsets like machine learning, deep learning and advanced artificial neural networks. The degree opened for enrollment in the spring of 2020 and counted five students in its inaugural semester. That number has since risen more than twentyfold, with the university counting 103 students in the program this fall. “It was a great investment now that we look back on it,” said Lewis. A portion of this surge can be attributed to the mainstream breakthrough of A.I. following the November 2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, said Lewis, who noted a “decent jump” in enrollment in connection to the chatbot’s release. But the program’s more significant surges occurred in relation to local initiatives like Empire A.I., a $400 million statewide research consortium unveiled by New York Governor Kathy Hochul earlier this year. The University at Buffalo is part of the new public-private research center and plans to build an A.I. supercomputing center on campus valued at $250 million. “I think there’s a lot of Google searches going on right now about A.I. degrees, Buffalo, and they’re finding our master’s program from all over the world,” said Lewis. The University at Buffalo isn’t the only school embracing A.I. into its degree programs. Schools like Carnegie Mellon, Purdue University and MIT were also early adopters, while the University of Pennsylvania earlier this year made history as the first Ivy League school to offer an undergraduate degree and a subsequent master’s in A.I. Carnegie Mellon, which established its A.I. undergraduate degree in 2018, has also seen a rise in interest. While its 2019 enrollment totaled 53, the program has reliably counted more than 100 students annually since 2021. Oregon State University’s graduate A.I. program grew from 15 students in its inaugural 2021 class to 62 last fall, and MIT’s A.I.-related undergraduate major counted 300 students this year compared to just 37 in 2022. A.I.-related undergraduate and master’s degree conferrals have risen by 120 percent since 2011, according to a 2023 report from Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, while A.I.-related Ph.D. conferrals have increased by 33 percent during that time. At the University at Buffalo, the school’s A.I. degree takes between 12 to 18 months to complete and has sent off alumni to companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon Web Services and Salesforce. The school is in the process of bolstering the program through initiatives like Advancing Top 25: Faculty Hiring, which has helped add more than 200 faculty members researching A.I. Such research is needed as the program’s subject matter continues to shift, according to Lewis. “We’re constantly working on improving the degree and making sure it continues to be relevant,” he said. Lewis added that its efforts are starting to pay off as people grasp the relevance of A.I. and begin perceiving it as a valuable sector in higher education. “I think students around the world are starting to realize, okay, this is here to stay,” he said.
