Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 4% on Thursday as the chipmaker's new AI lineup failed to excite investors who are eager to see the company take on Nvidia (NVDA). AMD's next-generation products, unveiled at its Advancing AI event today, come as demand for AI chips soars and AMD aims to expand its market share. Analysts said investors may have been looking for clearer signs of competition with AI investor darling Nvidia, an outlook boost, or a new customer announcement. AMD shares have gained 11% year-to-date (YTD) through Thursday’s close, trailing the S&P 500’s return by about half over the same period. The stock has lagged amid concerns that the chipmaker has failed to capitalize on the lucrative AI infrastructure boom. Below, we break down the technicals on AMD’s chart and identify important price levels investors should watch out for. Since a bearish engulfing pattern marked AMD’s all-time high (ATH) in early March, the chipmaker’s share price as oscillated within an orderly descending channel, a chart pattern consisting of parallel downward sloping trendlines indicating lower highs and lower lows. More recently, the stock has run into selling pressure around the channel’s upper trendline, with Thursday’s drop occurring on the heaviest trading volume since the early August sell-off, pointing to conviction behind the move lower. It’s also worth noting that although the stock remains above the 200-day moving average (MA), the indicator crossed above the 50-day MA in August to form a death cross—a chart signal predicting lower prices. Let’s take a look at three key lower price levels that could come into play if the chipmaker’s stock continues to undergo a retracement, and also use the chart to forecast an upside price target. The first area to eye sits around $162, not far below Thursday's closing price of $164.18. This is a location where the shares could attract buying interest near the 200-day MA and a trendline connecting a range of similar trading levels on the chart between February and October. If bulls fail to hold this level, the stock could fall to the $142 area, where it may find support from a horizontal line linking a period of consolidation in December last year with the prominent May trough. A deeper correction could see the shares revisit lower support around $122, a location on the chart where investors could look for buying opportunities near the channel’s lower trendline, which closely aligns with the early-August low and late-November 2023 peak. To forecast an upside price target above the descending channel, we can use the measuring principle. This chart technique works by calculating the distance between the pattern’s two trendlines and projecting that amount from the channel’s top trendline. In other words, we add $50 to $170, which forecasts an upside target of $220, slightly below the stock’s record high of $227.30.

Title: Nvidia, Mag 7 Flash Warning Signs For Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/10/10/nvidia-mag-7-flash-warning-signs-for-stocks/

The Fed surprised the market with an aggressive 50 bps cut recently, which has pushed the S&P 500 back to new all-time highs. However, not all markets are celebrating this move. Bond yields and mortgage rates, for example, have been in an uptrend since this decision, which is not normal to see at the onset of a rate cutting cycle. Also, the bull market leaders – the Mag 7 and AI focused semiconductors – are making a series of lower highs, not confirming this move in the S&P 500. This divergence between the market leaders and the broad market has been the consistent theme of the I/O Fund’s broad market reports in 2024. More times than not, the bull market leaders will lead on the way up, as well on the way down. So, when my firm sees the primary beneficiaries of a bull market start to make lower highs while the broad market makes higher highs, it tends to be a warning. Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang, left, talks about artifical intelligence with Meta's ... [+] chief Mark Zuckerberg at SIGGRAPH 2024, the premier conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques, Monday, July 29, 2024, in the Colorado Convention Center in downtown Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) In this report, my team will address the risks brewing in the market. The strange behavior in the bond market could be signaling that the FOMC has made a policy error. This coupled with key tech stocks trending lower against the S&P 500’s advance, has my firm cautious for the time being. In 2023 we saw these market leaders trending higher with the broad market. This was a powerful trend that lasted into late 2023. As a result, the collective Mag 7 returned around 90% in 2023 vs. the S&P 500 returning 24%. However, this trend is not continuing into 2024, as we are beginning to see cracks in market leadership. This year, the Mag 7 are up ~30% compared to the S&P 500’s ~20%. Though this year has been excellent for investors, it’s concerning the relative strength between the bull market leaders and the broad market is narrowing, which has been a constant theme in our broad market analysis throughout all of 2024. “When the cycle leaders start to underperform, it tends to mark the start of a trend change. The FAANGs have been the undoubted leaders of this bull run, and we are now seeing them start to trend lower against the indexes. More times than not, the leaders on the way up, tend to be the leaders on the way down.” More importantly, the Mag 7 is making a lower high, while the S&P 500 makes a higher high. In other words, the bull market leaders are not confirming this push higher in the broad market. This is a rare pattern that has only shown up one other time in this bull market – July of 2023, just before we saw an almost 11% correction in the broad market. A rare pattern observed in the bull market, similar to July 2023, preceding an 11% correction in the ... [+] broad market. This divergence is not only happening with the Mag 7, but it’s also happening with the most important sub-sector within tech due to AI – semiconductors. Since the current bull market began on October 13th of 2022, the Mag 7 has returned over 102% vs. the S&P 500’s 61%. During the same period, semiconductors have returned over 174%. The leading stock, Nvidia, is up over 967% over the same period. So, while the Mag 7 are the popular market leaders, the true market leaders of the current bull cycle are semiconductors, and specifically, Nvidia. This is a trend that the I/O Fund positioned for in 2022, making NVDA our largest position, as we rotated out of cloud stocks and into AI. Performance of the Mag 7, S&P 500, and semiconductors since October 13, 2022: The Mag 7 returned ... [+] over 102%, the S&P 500 returned 61%, and semiconductors returned over 174%, with Nvidia up over 967%. SMH has a history of leading market swings in the broad market. Since 2021, every time the S&P 500 made a new high without SMH, it preceded a period of volatility. Today’s divergence is one of the largest on record. The Semiconductor Index topped in July at $283, and is still well below this high, compared to the S&P 500 that just pushed to new a new high this week at 5796. Chart illustrating the semiconductor sub-sector’s corrective pattern, featuring a 3-wave drop since ... [+] June followed by a bounce from the August 5th low, suggesting a potential final drop targeting $190 to $165. When digging deeper into this key sub-sector, we can see that a clear corrective pattern is playing out. Since the June top, there is a clear 3 waves down. This has been followed, so far, by a symmetrical 3 wave bounce off the August 5th low. This pattern best fits a standard corrective patten. This implies that a final drop is still needed, which is targeting between $190 - $165. The advance seen today is poking above the downtrend line from the July top. However, this is happening on less volume and less momentum. Note the momentum indicator below the chart. It has given three lower highs while price provided three higher highs. This is a rare pattern that tends to precede a trend reversal. Chart depicting the current market advance above the July downtrend line, showing decreasing volume ... [+] and momentum. The momentum indicator reveals three lower highs, while the price shows three higher highs, suggesting a potential trend reversal. Nvidia topped in June at $140, and failed to make a new high in July with the rest of the Semiconductor Index. This was a warning that semis, and the broad market, were heading lower. This same relative weakness is still present today. While most semiconductors have broken out above their August high, NVDA remained below it. This week, it has moved above the August high, which appears to be the final move in this bounce which is happening on less momentum and less volume. This lines up with the I/O Fund’s game plan, which was to sell a quarter of our NVDA position in June around $129, and attempt to buy it lower in the coming months, which was discussed in detail on my recent interview. Chart illustrating NVDA’s incomplete corrective pattern, indicating potential drops below $114 and ... [+] $108, which could lead to a decline toward the $90 - $70 region, completing a multi-month correction. Like SMH, NVDA appears to be tracing an incomplete corrective pattern. A move below $114 and then $108 will signal that the stock is heading toward the $90 - $70 region, which would complete this multi-month correction. NVDA remains weaker than the broad market, as well as SMH. Considering the importance of this stock, as long as it remains below its June high, it is a warning to the current broad market advance. Some have argued that the market is taking gains in the AI leaders and spreading that money out into beaten down sectors. In other words, there is a healthy broadening out of the market, which typically exhibits strength. The narrative that supports this idea is that the FOMC just offered a surprise 50 bps rate cut into a seemingly healthy economy. The cheaper cost of borrowing should propel more economically sensitive sectors to play catch-up as the economic expansion continues. As plausible as this sounds, it’s just not showing up in data, yet. Since the Fed cut rates on September 18th, we are not seeing money flowing into your beaten down sectors that should do well if this narrative is playing out. Sectors like, transportation, small caps, retail sales, consumer discretionary and high beta are still under their 2021 highs. These are the sectors that would benefit from a soft-landing. As you can see below, aside from consumer discretionary, they are all underperforming the S&P 500. Chart illustrating the market dynamics where AI leaders are gaining, but beaten down sectors like ... [+] transportation, small caps, retail sales, consumer discretionary, and high beta are still lagging behind the S&P 500, showing no significant investment flow after the FOMC’s 50 bps rate cut. While Nvidia and Semiconductors are making a lower high, there is more money flowing into defensive and inflationary markets, like, Energy, Apple, Utilities and even the US dollar is doing better than the markets that would support the broadening out narrative. Another unusual development since the Fed cut rates is that bonds are not acting as they should at the onset of a rate cutting cycle. Historically, the relationship between long-dated bonds and the Fed cutting rates has been an inverse relationship. As the Fed cuts rates, it is usually in the face of a weakening economy. If prices are going down due to demand collapsing, then a fixed yield is desirable in that environment, meaning that we should see bonds going higher. This is not what is happening today. The day the Fed cut rates, the 10-year government bond began a sharp decline and is currently down nearly 4% from its high. This is a big move for the 10-year bond. Chart showing the 10-year government bond’s sharp decline after the Fed’s rate cut, highlighting an ... [+] unusual trend where bond prices typically rise in a weakening economy. The bond is down nearly 4% from its high. This is unusual behavior, as the above chart shows. Bonds should be going higher, not lower, based on historical comparisons. The popular narrative for this behavior in the bond market is that this is evidence that the FED accomplished a soft landing. If we were going into a slowing economy, which could lead to a deflationary event, then bonds would be catching a bid. So, the fact that we are not must mean that the economy is strong, and the economic expansion will only continue. This will then propel asset prices higher, as well as inflation, making the need for fixed yields a poor investment. As we just saw, the market is not buying this narrative, as money is not flowing into the sectors that would support this thesis. So, what could be going on? It’s important to understand that the Fed does not control the 10-year yield; this is controlled by the bond market’s expectations for future growth and inflation. The Fed’s reasoning for aggressively dropping rates on September 18th was that inflation is heading to 2% and the employment market is starting to show weakness. Since then, the ISM non-manufacturing PMI posted its hottest reading since February of 2023. Twelve out of the 18 segments of this report stated that prices are rising, not falling. Chart highlighting the ISM non-manufacturing PMI’s highest reading since February 2023, with 12 of ... [+] 18 segments reporting rising prices. Additionally, the labor market added 107,000 more jobs than expected, revising September figures up by 17,000, causing the unemployment rate to drop from 4.22% to 4.05%. This was accompanied with a labor market that is much stronger than expected. The most recent jobs report showed that the US added 107,000 more jobs than expected, while September’s report was revised higher by 17,000 jobs. This caused the unemployment rate to drop back to 4.05% from 4.22%. This is further confirmed with current mortgage rates. Everyone was expecting mortgage rates to drop with the Fed Funds Rate. However, since the cut, there has been a sharp increase in average mortgage rate from 6% to 6.32%. Current mortgage rates defy expectations, rising sharply from 6% to 6.32% following the Fed’s rate ... [+] cut, contrary to the anticipated decrease. The reason for this is because mortgage rates are not determined by the Fed. Instead, they are the result of an equation that includes the 10-year yield and the borrower’s credit score. So, the 10-year getting sold, means yields are going up. This happening on the day of the FED’s rate cut policy means the bond market is not convinced inflation is heading to 2%, which is pushing mortgage rates higher. This means that we could be getting signals that the FED made a policy error, and dropped rates too soon, as yields continue to climb in the weeks after this decision. Interesting enough, at the Grant’s Annual Fall Conference, Druckenmiller stated that his largest bet is shorting the US bond market. His reasoning is not because the Fed achieved a successful soft landing, which the consensus believes, but it is because “bipartisan fiscal recklessness is on the horizon.” In other words, the larger our deficits become, the more money will need to be borrowed to cover interest payments. As more and more debt gets created, yields will have to go up to attract more buyers, which will put pressure on fiscal budgets, and therefore creates a vicious cycle. To put this into perspective, the budget deficit for the fiscal year 2024 is going to come in around $1.9 Trillion, or 6.7% of GDP. There is no other year in US history where the budget deficient was this large outside of a major war, like WW I & WW II, or dealing with a major recession, like 2008. It is unheard of to have fiscal spending this high, in an expanding economy, with historically low unemployment. This makes you wonder what the deficit will look like in the face of a contraction. This was an issue that the market has been aware of for decades but was able to ignore due to historically low interest rates. With rates low and trending lower, this fiscal recklessness was allowed to go on. However, we are seeing for the first time in 30 years, bond yields are starting a new uptrend. Since 1981, the 10-year yield has been in a classic downtrend, making a series of lower highs. This trend made borrowing easier, as low rates made the cost of borrowing affordable. However, in 2021, yields broke this downtrend and made their first higher highs in 30 years. Today, yields are higher than they were in 2008, making the cost of borrowing higher than most investors are used to in over 20 years. Diagram illustrating the market’s awareness of excessive debt and low interest rates enabling fiscal ... [+] recklessness. Since 1981, the 10-year yield has followed a downtrend until breaking the trend in 2021, resulting in the highest borrowing costs seen in over 20 years. If this uptrend in yields continues, which looks likely, it would become problematic for inflation expectations, as well as the Fed’s ability to lower rates. It will also become problematic for the cost to service government debts, as more debt will be issued at higher rates to cover current service requirements. And, it will become problematic for stocks, specifically high beta stocks that need to borrow to fund operations, as estimates on future cash flows will have to account for a higher cost to borrow. In short, the last +20 years have built on the idea that inflation will not happen, and the FED can keep rates close to zero. The bull market pattern off the 2022 low has taken the shape of a messy diagonal pattern. This is a 5 wave pattern where the internal waves are 3 waves in all directions. It is also marked with large, overlapping swings. Note how wave 4 went into wave 1 territory – this is typical of diagonals. The 5th wave in this pattern is a blow off, and from what I can tell, we are in the final swing of this pattern. If SPX can breakout above 5825, then it can likely push into the 6000 – 6185 region. If instead, it breaks down below 5675 this will be your first indication of a potential trend change. Below 5500 and then 5115 will be the final confirmations. Chart illustrating a messy diagonal pattern in the bull market since the 2022 low, consisting of 5 ... [+] waves with overlapping swings. Key breakout points are at 5825, while downtrend confirmations are at 5675 and 5500, indicating potential trend changes. In conclusion, as the economic expansion continues, the odds of a recession remain low. However, money is not flowing into the beaten down sectors that would benefit from this reality. Instead, defensive and inflationary names are getting more flows than transportation, small caps, high beta and retail sales. The market leaders continue to make lower highs while the broad market pushes higher, and bonds are getting sold as if the FED stopped cutting rates, not started. The warning signs are high, and my firm remains defensive until these signals reverse, or the market corrects.

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground after the latest Consumer Price Index report showed greater-than-expected price increases in September, driven by an uptick in grocery prices. In addition to weighing on household budgets, the hot inflation data could constrain the Federal Reserve as policymakers deliberate over further interest-rate cuts. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% on Thursday, while the Dow was down 0.1%. Both indexes receded from record closes posted in the previous session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also retreated, though it fared slightly better, closing with a minimal daily loss of less than 0.1%. Shares of solar panel producer First Solar (FSLR) plunged 9.3%, the most of any S&P 500 constituent, after Jefferies reduced its price target on the stock to $266 from $271. Research analysts warned of potential delays that could restrain First Solar's volumes in the current quarter and those to come. Other solar industry stocks also moved lower: Shares of solar technology firm Enphase Energy (ENPH) slipped 5.8%. Semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) unveiled new artificial intelligence (AI) chips at its "Advancing AI 2024" event in San Francisco on Thursday. Its shares dropped 4%, with some analysts suggesting that its presentation may not have been sufficient to convince investors that its new products will be able to compete with AI chips from Nvidia (NVDA). Shares of Generac Holdings (GNRC), which provides home generators and other power solutions, fell 3.5% as Hurricane Milton moved through Florida. Thursday's downturn reversed a portion of the gains posted by the stock ahead of the storm. The day's strongest performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), which climbed 5.6% after RBC Capital included the stock on its list of top picks in the software space. Analysts believe the company is successfully moving past an incident in July when a faulty software update caused widespread IT outages around the world. Shares of fertilizer maker Mosaic Co. (MOS) gained 4.4%. Based in Tampa, Fla., Mosaic faced uncertainties about the potential impact of Hurricane Milton on its operations. The company said Thursday that it will begin to assess the impact of the storm as soon as conditions allow. Shares of Micron Technology (MU) shares added 3.9%. Although AMD's AI event may have failed to generate much investor enthusiasm, its new chips included more memory than previous products, underlining the importance of high-bandwidth memory for AI processes. Micron, which manufactures memory chips, is a partner of AMD.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced new artificial intelligence chips to boost its rivalry with other chipmakers, including Nvidia (NVDA). The chipmaker launched its new Instinct MI325X accelerators and Ryzen AI PRO 300 series processors along with other leading-edge computing chips on Thursday at its Advancing AI conference in San Francisco. “The data center and AI represent significant growth opportunities for AMD, and we are building strong momentum for our EPYC and AMD Instinct processors across a growing set of customers,” AMD chief executive Lisa Su said in a statement. With its new chips, AMD is “delivering leadership compute to power our customers’ most important and demanding workloads,” she added. By 2028, AMD sees the market for data center AI accelerators reaching $500 billion, Su said, adding that the chipmaker is “committed to delivering open innovation at scale through our expanded silicon, software, network and cluster-level solutions.” At Computex in June, Su announced AMD’s next-generation MI325X AI accelerator with improved “performance and memory capabilities for the most demanding AI” processing, which she said would be available in the fourth quarter. She also unveiled the Ryzen AI PRO 300 series which will be used for AI laptops, including Microsoft’s (MSFT) Copilot+ PCs. Like rival Nvidia, Su said in June that AMD has “expanded our roadmap so it’s now on an annual cadence, that means a new product family every year.” AMD expects to launch its next-generation Instinct MI350 series accelerators in the second half of 2025, the chipmaker said. Its Instinct MI400 Series accelerators are planned for 2026. The company’s Instinct MI300X accelerators were launched in December, and are used by some of the world’s leading AI models from OpenAI, Meta (META), and open-source models on Hugging Face.

Title: PC shipments fall in Q3 despite AI push by Microsoft, chipmakers

The global PC industry hit a snag in the third quarter, as worldwide shipments declined for the first time in three quarters — despite hype around so-called artificial intelligence PCs and growth in the US and Japan. According to Gartner, third quarter PC shipments, or devices sent out to retailers for sale, fell 1.3% year over year to 62.9 million units from 63.8 million units in the same period in 2023. Shipments dropped the most in China, with Gartner reporting a 10% collapse in demand in the country as government and state-affiliated entities sought out fewer desktops. Shipments in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa took a less dramatic hit than China, dropping 1.5% due to a flurry of events that Gartner says distracted consumers, including elections in the UK and France and sporting events like the Olympics. The US, meanwhile, saw a 5.6% increase in shipments, while Japan saw double-digit growth in the quarter. Still, the PC industry is in the midst of a broader comeback after years of declines and the massive amount of growth it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. At the time, consumers and enterprises bought up virtually as many PCs as they could get their hands on to ensure they had the means to work and stay entertained while stuck in their homes for months on end. But that boom meant people who might have been holding off on buying PCs ended up purchasing them sooner than they otherwise would have, pulling future sales forward. With so many customers outfitted with new PCs, demand crumbled, leading to an extended slump that lasted roughly two years, including the worst decline in 17 years in 2023. The slump hit companies ranging from PC manufacturers for Microsoft (MSFT) to chipmakers Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA). In Q2 2023, as sales struggled, Microsoft reported that its Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% year over year. Intel and AMD saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter 2023 Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million. The shipment declines come as the PC industry is pushing the concept of AI PCs, or computers outfitted with neural processing units (NPUs) or high-powered graphics cards that can run AI applications locally rather than via the cloud. Microsoft is pushing its own version of AI PCs it refers to as Copilot+ PCs, which meet certain hardware requirements such as powerful NPUs. But the marketing doesn’t seem to be paying off. According to Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa, AI PCs “did not boost the demand for PCs since buyers have yet to see their clear benefits or business value.” What’s more, she said, the end of Windows 10 support in 2025 didn’t drive updates in areas like China. There’s still plenty of debate about whether AI will become a huge selling point for consumer electronics, whether that’s PCs or smartphones. So far, Microsoft has shown off a number of potentially useful AI features for Windows 11, including its Click to Do option that provides you with a context-sensitive set of options to take action on what you’re viewing on your screen. Microsoft says you can do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing, allowing the search engine to search for content based on images rather than words. But it’s not clear yet if AI is a major selling point for consumers. Jefferies recently downgraded Apple’s stock saying that expectations for AI-powered iPhones are overblown. And if that holds true, you can bet it’ll be the same for PCs. Regardless of the declines in Q3 or whether AI proves to be the kind of catalyst the industry needs, Kitagawa says PC shipments should improve for the year as a whole and blow up in 2025. “At the worldwide level, PC demand will see more uptake toward the end of 2024 and more robust growth in 2025, when the PC refresh will be at its peak,” said Kitagawa.

Title: Morgan Stanley Details What Caused NVIDIA’s Blackwell Hiccup, Asserts That The Blackwell Production Ramp-Up Appears “Quite Strong”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Given the quantum of fund inflows into AI-related investment themes, Wall Street appears laser-focused on NVIDIA's Blackwell production ramp-up as a guarantor of sorts for the secular AI tailwind. Today, Morgan Stanley has penned yet another note on NVIDIA's latest GPU architecture, this time choosing to divulge some additional information regarding what exactly caused a production bottleneck over the summer. As we've noted in previous posts, NVIDIA had confirmed the rumors of a minor Blackwell design flaw during its recent earnings call, but assured investors that the resulting low-yields issue was rectified by implementing a few minor changes to the photomask - a specific template that is used to create bespoke patterns on semiconductor wafers. NVIDIA $NVDA Blackwell ramp appears "quite strong" and issues with initial Blackwell silicon are "totally behind us", says Morgan Stanley, reiterating at 'Overweight' with a $150 price-target: "In the shorter term, the Blackwell ramp appears to be quite strong, with no major… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 10, 2024 Now, Morgan Stanley is out with its own take on the Blackwell production hiccup, noting that the low-yields issue was only discovered in the post-packaging stage. The ensuing scrapping of the subpar units resulted in a loss of "CoWoS and HBM3e," which were already in short supply and only aggravated NVIDIA's supply problems. Morgan Stanley goes on to note: "But those issues are behind the company and there is high conviction in prior guidance that they will have several billion in Blackwell revenue in the January quarter." Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley has reiterated that it now sees a "quite strong" Blackwell production ramp-up, "with no major changes to the roadmaps and every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility, in line with all of our checks." In a critical insight, Morgan Stanley notes: "Any new Blackwell orders now that aren't already in queue will be shipped late next year, as they are booked out 12 months or so, which continues to drive strong short term demand for Hopper which will still be a major factor though the year." Of course, the Wall Street titan has already stated that it sees NVIDIA shipping up to 450,000 units of the Blackwell GPUs in the December-ending quarter, resulting in between $5 billion and $10 billion in revenue. Moreover, Morgan Stanley believes that NVIDIA will produce between 700,000 and 800,000 units of Blackwell GPUs in Q1'25, which corresponds to a 3x sequential increase in volumes. At the same time, the bank sees Hopper volumes at 1.5 million units in Q4'24, and at around 1 million units in Q1'25.

Title: Macro Guru Hugh Hendry Betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and Lower Interest Rates for 2025 – Here’s Why

Hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry is betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and low interest rates next year. Hendry says there “always two ever-present tail risks” in a short volatility investment strategy, which aims to profit off decreases in market volatility by selling options. “Do you buy the call option that the Mag-7 become capitalized at 100% of GDP or that rates descend rapidly to the lower bound? That’s why I keep hammering on about observing where stock levels are on the day of the next cut. I’m running a barbell: long BTC and long calls on <2% Fed Funds at year end 2025 I am of course exposed to a tracking error, that stocks surge and bitcoin is flat or down on some idiosyncratic news. I’m content to run that risk.” Mag-7 refers to the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL; GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). Hendry also compares Bitcoin’s size to the Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the Nasdaq-100 Index. “BTC is everyone’s phantom, good or bad. In reality, its MASS renders it irrelevant to this conversation but highly attractive for upside consideration. In the game of Newton’s Cradle, MASS is paramount today, it’s the outlier. BTC’s capitalization is just $1 trillion. QQQ is $42 trillion. The Qs, or rather the $13 trillion in the Mag-7, are therefore the only consideration. Bank stock lending renders the robustness of that valuation paramount. If that melts, the credit unravels, the margin call is immense. Perhaps doesn’t happen, but if I were a bank I’d be circumspect about the moneyness of that collateral. I’d be trying to contra-cyclically reduce my assets, markets and their liquidity permitting. By moneyness I mean the pledged assets’ proximity to a t-bill. Your t-bill ain’t gonna lose 83% of its value over the next 18 months. Bur stocks capitalized at these vaunted levels vis-a-vis GDP have periodically suffered such reversals.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: GOOGL vs. META: Which AI/Big Data Stock Is Better?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/googl-vs-meta-ai-big-064609819.html
Time Published: 2024-10-10T06:46:09Z
Full Content:
In this piece, I evaluated two AI/Big Data stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META). A closer look suggests bullish ratings for both, although a clear winner emerges. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, generates revenue from online advertising, sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, and fees on cloud services and other licensing revenue. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, also generates revenue from online advertising. Shares of Alphabet have tumbled 12% over the last three months, bringing their year-to-date gain to 20%, which accounts for nearly all of the 21% one-year return. In contrast, Meta Platforms stock is up 12% over the last three months for a year-to-date jump of 69% and a one-year bounce of 88%. The two companies’ equally opposite three-month performances create a setup for an interesting matchup, as outlined below. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.5x, there’s no ignoring the fact that Alphabet is cheap. While concerns about generative AI could threaten the technology giant, the current P/E is just too cheap to ignore, suggesting a bullish view is in order. Notably, advertising still accounts for the lion’s share of Alphabet’s quarterly revenue, including $64.6 billion of the $84.7 billion in total revenue. Google Search alone accounted for $48.5 billion of total revenue. Thus, it’s easy to see why some might give credence to the concerns raised by a fund manager last week. However, I would suggest that his view might be a bit short-sighted, especially since Search revenue is still growing. At the 2024 Quality-Growth Conference last week, Stephen Yiu of Blue Whale Capital explained why he’s bearish on Alphabet right now. He expects generative AI to significantly change Alphabet’s business model, although he does see some upside left in the near term. Nonetheless, he maintains a negative view due to signs of a market share decline from Google Search, which once held a 90% share. Furthermore, Alphabet’s AI model, Gemini, has yet to meet the expectations set by competing models. Despite Yiu’s longer-term concerns for Alphabet, this looks like a buy-the-dip opportunity. On a P/E basis, the shares have been range-bound since about April 2023. However, they’re currently at the bottom of the valuation range, suggesting another leg up could be in the offing soon. Even if Alphabet does enter a period of struggle, as Yiu maintains, this company isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. In short, Alphabet is one of those stocks that’s good to buy and hold for the long term, although the size of the position in your portfolio might fluctuate based on valuation. Thus, I would recommend a small position right now if you don’t already have one, potentially with plans to add a few more shares if you already have a position. After all, Alphabet has more than doubled over the past five years, rising 174%. Additionally, should Gemini deliver positive surprises, Alphabet shares will rise further, potentially breaking out of their current range. We’re already starting to see signs of this with the integration into Google Search and the recent Gemini at Work event, which covered a range of AI use cases for enterprises. Alphabet has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, nine Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $200.29, the average Alphabet stock price target implies upside potential of 21.85%. See more GOOGL analyst ratings At a P/E of 30x, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s on the rise after hitting bottom at around 25.5x in early August. Meta has been rangebound for about a year or so on a P/E basis and is approaching the middle of that range. Nonetheless, a long-term bullish view looks appropriate. Meta Platforms is less diversified than Alphabet, capturing 98% of its revenue from advertising in the second quarter. This could prevent a problem in the event that digital advertising goes south, though that looks doubtful. Yiu also commented on Meta Platforms, picking it as his top Magnificent Seven stock aside from NVIDIA (NVDA). He believes that Meta has greater access to personal information than Alphabet, thanks to the interactions occurring across its various platforms. He noted that this provides more personal information about individuals than just searching for things on Google. Further, Yiu mentioned that he believes ads on Meta Platforms will become more personalized through generative AI, which he expects to have a greater impact on Meta than on Alphabet. He argues that personal interactions are more likely to drive immediate purchase decisions compared to Google searches. Additionally, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg supported Yiu’s remarks, stating that AI will allow Meta to offer even more tailored advertisements. I would agree with Yiu on these points, but I don’t think Meta will enjoy greater benefits from AI than Alphabet, especially over the long term. Notably, Meta’s ad revenue growth rate reached 22% in the second quarter, double that of Google’s growth rate. However, it’s important to consider that Alphabet’s growth rate was based on a much larger scale versus Meta’s total revenue of $39.1 billion for Q2. Meta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $607.92, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies downside potential of 2.54%. See more META analyst ratings Although both Alphabet and Meta Platforms receive bullish ratings, Alphabet is the clear winner here. Google Cloud revenues continued to rise sequentially, surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the second quarter. The Cloud division accounts for Alphabet’s AI revenue, which is critical because AI is already starting to cover for the drop in ad revenue. On the other hand, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s verging on overbought territory with a Relative Strength Index of 69.4. Ultimately, I expect Alphabet and Meta to both capture significant AI revenues. However, Alphabet takes the crown this time around due to valuation and the fact that it was able to put an actual number on AI-related revenue, while Meta just talked about AI making a difference in its revenue growth.

Astera Labs (ALAB) shares jumped Wednesday after the Nvidia (NVDA) supplier announced new products to support artificial intelligence (AI). The company introduced two new fabric switches that Nvidia Senior VP of GPU Engineering Brian Kelleher said will support the chipmaker's AI infrastructure "across a wide variety of AI and [high-performance computing] workloads." Astera, which went public in March, said in its initial public offering (IPO) filing that its customers include several key players in the AI space such as Nvidia, as well as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Jefferies analysts said the new products could help Astera diversify its offerings and expand the market for its products. The analysts held a "buy" rating for the stock, with a price target of $65, about 6% above Wednesday's closing price of $61.22. Astera Labs shares surged over 15% Wednesday, and have gained about 70% from their IPO price in March.

Following a brief but dramatic dip in late August and early September, Nvidia has rebounded sharply. The stock closed down slightly on Wednesday at $132.65, just shy of its closing high of $135.58 reached in June. Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft as the second-most valuable company, behind only Apple. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom, as companies including Meta, OpenAI, Alphabet, Microsoft and Oracle continue to unveil technologies and products that require hefty investments in its graphics processing units, or GPUs. In August, Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that showed revenue rose 122% year over year while net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion. The company also gave stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter and said it expects to ship several billion dollars worth of its new Blackwell AI chip. Demand is so high that Nvidia anticipates shipments for its current-generation Hopper chip to increase over the next two quarters. "We see NVDA remaining the leader in the AI training and inference chips for Data Center applications," Mizuho analysts said in a note Wednesday, estimating that the company has about 95% market share. The analysts have a $140 price target on the stock but noted risks in potentially escalating export restrictions to China, geopolitical tensions regarding Taiwan or a significant pullback in AI server spending. "Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first," CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview last week on CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime," speaking of the "insane" demand for the Blackwell chip. Production for the GPU, which will cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. The stock rallied for other reasons over the last month, too. Nvidia shares jumped 4% on Sept. 23, after a filing showed Huang finished selling the company's stock. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

Title: Nvidia wants to drive AI costs down as 'reasoning' models rise

Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips have been a driver of the current artificial intelligence boom — and the chipmaker only wants to make it move faster, chief executive Jensen Huang said. During an appearance on the Tech Unheard podcast, Huang was asked by host Rene Haas, chief executive of British semiconductor company Arm (ARM), if the pace of AI innovation is moving “faster than you imagined.” Huang replied, “No,” and said Nvidia is “trying to make it go faster.” “We’ve gone to a one-year cycle,” Huang said about the company’s production of new chips. “And the reason for that is because the technology has the opportunity to move fast.” Nvidia is designing “six or seven new chips per system,” Huang said, then using “co-design to reinvent the entire system” and inventing other technologies that allow it to improve performance by two or three times while using the same amount of energy and cost each year. “That’s another way of, essentially, reducing the cost of AI by two or three times per year,” Huang said. “That is way faster than Moore’s Law.” Over the next few years, Huang said, Nvidia wants to drive down the cost of AI amid the rise of even more complex models. This evolution is already underway. In September, OpenAI released a new series of “reasoning” AI models called o1, which are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond,” the way humans do. In the future, AI services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which Huang said he uses every day, will “iteratively reason about the answer” and could go through hundreds or thousands of inferences before producing an output. This level of complex processing would require significantly more computational power than current models. Despite the increased demands, Huang believes the trade-off is worthwhile. “[T]he quality of the answer is so much better,” Huang said. “We want to drive the cost down so that we could deliver this new type of reasoning inference with the same level of cost and responsiveness as the past.” On Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock was climbing back toward its record high $135 close in June. The chipmaker’s shares were down 0.27% during midday trading, but opened up almost 1% at around $134 per share.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock is aiming for a new all-time high close as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom. The stock traded flat midday Wednesday at $133. It previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. Nvidia stock notched its fifth consecutive day of gains Tuesday, rising 4% to $132.89. Shares are up 12% from last week. The stock’s climb has been fueled by a barrage of good news for the company. Wall Street analysts this week have reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday. Nvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Nvidia’s weeklong ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second-quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China, due to rising trade tensions with the US, had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June. Other positive news in the semiconductor sector Wednesday could help Nvidia stock achieve a new record close. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term. “AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.” The chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown. Semiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that it’s boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs (graphics processing units). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

AI behemoth NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is breaking out and could be heading to its June high of around $141 per share, according to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies. "Heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) confirmed a triangle breakout yesterday, supporting near-term follow-through toward its June high (~$141)," Stockton said. "While the SPX and NDX have seen short-term momentum weaken, NVDA’s breakout is likely to prevent a major pullback in the major indices, which is part of the reason why we keep a short-term neutral bias for U.S. equities in today's Fairlead Tactics." NVIDIA stock has been up six straight sessions, including today's fractional gain of 0.12%. The stock is up more than 170% year-to-date. Analysts have been increasingly bullish on the company's Blackwell product, which the CEO Jensen Huang said is seeing "insane" demand. "Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and demand for Blackwell is insane," Huang said on CNBC's last week. "Everyone wants the most, and everyone wants to be first." Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) reported that September sales beat estimates on solid AI chip demand. TSM said revenue for September 2024 was approximately NT$251.87 billion, an increase of 0.4 percent from August 2024 and an increase of 39.6 percent from September 2023. TSM makes NVIDIA's AI chip. On Tuesday, analysts at Morgan Stanley said Blackwell production revenue in 1Q25 may surpass Hopper. Blackwell chips command a price premium, with B200 chips priced 60-70% higher than H200, positioning Blackwell revenue to overtake Hopper in the upcoming quarter.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are nearing their all-time highs Wednesday morning on positive news about the chipmaker's artificial intelligence (AI) products. Nvidia shares, which have ended higher the past five sessions, recently edged up to $133.30. Their all-time closing high is $135.58, achieved on June 18, and record intraday high is $140.76, recorded the following session two days later, after markets were closed for Juneteenth. On Tuesday, contract electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn reported strong demand for its servers powered by Nvidia's GB200 semiconductors, part of the latter's Blackwell architecture. Microsoft announced it was "the 1st cloud" running the Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers. OpenAI also thanked Nvidia for delivering "one of the first engineering builds of the DGX B200 to our office." Also yesterday, Nvidia noted that the Blackwell platform has slashed energy consumption by up to 2,000 times over the last decade for AI training models such as OpenAI's GPT-4. Bob Pette, vice president and general manager of Nvidia's enterprise platforms, told participants at the company's AI Summit that "We are in the dawn of a new industrial revolution," adding that the firm is "designing our systems with not just performance in mind, but with energy efficiency in mind." Nvidia shares have soared about 170% this year. TradingView

September sales rose at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), with the chipmaker on Wednesday reporting numbers that pointed toward better-than-expected third-quarter revenue. The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported September sales of 251.87 billion New Taiwan dollars ($7.82 billion), up just under 40% from the same time last year. Added to its results for August and July, TSMC reported NT$759.69 billion ($23.58 billion) in revenue for the third quarter, above the NT$749.88 billion analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had expected and roughly 36% above sales for the third quarter of 2023. The results surpassed TSMC's own outlook, as the company said in its second-quarter earnings report that it expected third-quarter revenue between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. The company's US-traded shares were recently down more than 1% as broader markets wavered. The stock has risen steadily from August lows and is near record levels, up roughly 75% this year. The PHLX index of semiconductor shares edged lower Thursday. TSMC is set to report the rest of its third-quarter financial results on the morning of Oct. 17. The company surpassed estimates in the first two quarters of 2024, as demand for its chips to power AI technology have remained in high demand.

Nvidia stock seems to be climbing back to its record high close from June. The AI chipmaker’s stock was up almost 1% at the open on Wednesday, to about $134 per share. It later fell to about $133 per share. Nvidia (NVDA) shares closed at almost $133 the day before. Nvidia’s rising stock has pushed its market capitalization past Microsoft’s (MSFT) again. During Wednesday morning trading, the chipmaker’s market cap reached $3.26 trillion, while Microsoft’s was $3.09 trillion. Both trailed Apple’s (AAPL) market cap of $3.44 trillion. In June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite falling back down, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings. In June, Nvidia’s shares closed at a record high $135.58, days after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. Since then, its shares have experienced some turbulence, but the company’s stock is still up 173.4% so far this year. Compared to a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up 192%. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which supplies Nvidia and Apple with chips, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue of NT$759.7 billion, or $23.6 billion, for the September quarter, according to Reuters. Compared to a year ago, TSMC’s revenue grew 36.5%, Reuters calculated. In July, the chipmaker said it expects third-quarter revenue to be between $22.4 billion and 23.2 billion.

Talk about an undecided market. As of the close on Monday, October 7, in four of the past five days, the closing range of the S&P 500 (SPX) was 13.6 points. That is two-tenths of 1% based on the price of the index. For the Nasdaq, the range in four out of five days was 14.76 points or eight one-hundredths of 1%. The Nasdaq 100's (QQQ) range was 0.83 points or two-tenths of 1%. The Nasdaq and the QQQ tested their 21-day exponential a few times and remain perilously close to breaking that average, while the SPX has come close to the average on several occasions intraday. Third-quarter EPS season is now underway and the next three weeks will be very heavy with earnings reports. Just prior to and just after earnings reports, companies are in a blackout period. During that time, a company cannot repurchase its stock. So in April/early May, July/early August, October/early November, and January/early February, there is an absence of demand that can create weakness in the overall market. First-quarter 2024 share buybacks on the S&P 500 were $237 billion and for the 12-months ending March 2024, buybacks were $817 billion.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business

Time Published: 2024-10-09T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.

Tejas Dessai, director of research at Global X, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): The chairman of Foxconn said the AI boom “still has time to go.” Chip makers such as Nvidia are up on the news today. Where do you see the next phase of artificial intelligence expansion coming from? TEJAS DESSAI (TD): We expect it to play out in several phases. Currently, the first phase focuses on building the infrastructure that is needed to run, train, and deploy these AI models. And in this particular phase, clearly, you need semiconductors that are specialized — the chips that Nvidia (NVDA) provides or companies like AMD (AMD) or Intel (INTC) are even trying to provide. Now, on the other hand, you have companies like Broadcom (AVGO) that want to participate in this revolution through ASIC-type chips. There’s a wide area of other chips, as well. But beyond that, we also anticipate the broader data center industry being very well positioned here, as that infrastructure build-out happens at a very large scale, as well. So it’s clearly still early days in this revolution; we expect a large number of companies within the semiconductor value chain to participate in this. But beyond that, you have the hyperscalers with their own play. You have the data center operators and then, eventually, a much broader area of network infrastructure that will play a role in bringing these AI systems to the common masses. AM: Data centers are going to be a big part of the next phase of AI. What companies do you see taking advantage of it? TD: What’s happening now is you are seeing an increasing mix of AI-specific workloads come into the data center equation. And AI workloads are extremely computer-intensive. They’re energy-intensive. They need a very different kind of memory, very different kind of storage systems, very different kind of networking solutions, cooling systems, power requirements. So it’s really a breadth of innovation that we are seeing here with companies participating in this across the spectrum. In the first phase, obviously, you’re starting to see the semiconductor players benefit from this. But as we see more and more AI clusters being deployed, you could see an uptake in memory solutions, in storage solutions, in networking solutions. And you have companies across the spectrum there that play into that equation. And from there on, we expect companies that specialize in providing comprehensive data center solutions — complete clusters of AI that the average S&P 500 enterprise can leverage. So you talk about data center operators like Equinix (EQIX) or Digital Realty (DLR) or Next DC and several others around the world, we expect these companies to be able to participate in this revolution through infrastructure provisioning. At the same time, you have your traditional hyperscalers, the FAANG names that build these massive computing facilities and really sell that capacity through their cloud franchises. You have Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) for sure, Google (GOOGL) Cloud, even companies like IBM (IBM) benefiting from that revolution. As they see incremental growth within their cloud franchises, they will be compelled to invest more significantly in building this infrastructure, which, again, benefits a large area of component providers in that list. AM: Gotcha. So a big driver in economic growth over the last couple of years has been these big tech companies — their stocks are way up. Would you recommend that investors continue to invest in Big Tech going into the fourth quarter and beyond into 2025? TD: Our advice to our clients has been to focus on adding exposure to the ancillary areas around this new revolution that is forming. Data centers are obviously top of mind. You need to have some sort of exposure to the entire data center value chain if you want to participate within the AI revolution. Beyond that, you can look at the consumer semiconductor ecosystem. You can look at cloud computing ecosystem because ultimately you will see a large breadth of these technology companies participating in this cycle and benefiting from that growth, as well.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 4% in Tuesday, notching its fifth straight day of gains. Wall Street analysts at KeyBanc, Citi (C), Bernstein, and several other investment firms reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock this week. KeyBanc analysts raised their fiscal year 2025 sales outlook for Nvidia from $128.5 billion to $130.6 billion, with Nvidia’s new flagship Blackwell AI chips contributing $7 billion to fourth quarter revenues. That’s higher than Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $125.6 billion for 2025 revenue, according to Bloomberg data. Even as production of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips ramps up, KeyBanc said in a note to investors Monday that demand for Nvidia’s prior AI chip models — H100s and H200s — “remains extremely robust.” Nvidia shares are up nearly 14% over the past week and 190% from last year. Wedbush analysts said “another positive data point” for Nvidia is a potential new wave of funding for AI startups. The Information reported Monday that OpenAI’s staggering $6.6 billion funding round will likely drive a wave of new AI investments. New funding for AI-related startups would, in turn, fuel demand for Nvidia's AI chips. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson said on Tuesday that the report is an indication "that there is little likelihood AI spending growth pauses through much (if not all of 2025) to NVDA's benefit." Nvidia is also looking to prove its worth beyond AI hardware. At its AI Summit in D.C. this week, the company is attempting to highlight the strength of its AI software offerings in a bid to show that it’s more than just a chipmaker. Adding to the wave of positive press for Nvidia was the announcement of Foxconn's (2354.TW) new megafactory assembling Nvidia's AI servers. The chair of the Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer, Young Liu, said during an annual event in Taipei Tuesday that Foxconn is building the world’s largest factory assembling Nvidia GB200 servers in Mexico, according to the Financial Times. Liu said there is “crazy” demand for Nvidia’s latest AI chips. The move will reduce Nvidia’s reliance on China amid rising trade tensions. Nvidia and Foxconn said they're also working to build Taiwan's fastest supercomputer. Nvidia isn’t the only semiconductor company that’s thriving. Citing WSTS semiconductor industry data, JPMorgan (JPM) said Tuesday that sector-wide sales rose 28% in August from last year. “We remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 [the second half of 2024 and 2025] and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25 [the 2024 and 2025 calendar years].” The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) both rose more than 1% on Tuesday. Meanwhile, chipmakers in China faced a different fate Tuesday. After China’s economic planning agency failed to live up to the market’s hope for more stimulus measures, China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (0981.HK) fell 18%. Investors had expected stimulus initiatives to boost China’s semiconductor sector. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose on Tuesday after Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, touted strong demand for artificial intelligence servers. Executives at Foxconn—officially named Hon Hai Precision Industry—said Tuesday at the company's annual tech day they were constructing in Mexico the world’s largest facility for assembling AI servers to house Nvidia’s GB200 chips, part of its Blackwell AI architecture. Young Liu, chair of Foxconn, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that the company is aiming to produce 20,000 GB200 NVL72 servers at the factory in 2025. HSBC analysts have estimated the price of one GB200 NVL72 server is about $3 million. Demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell system is “awfully huge,” said Benjamin Ting, Foxconn’s senior vice president of cloud enterprise solutions, at the company’s tech day. Liu told Bloomberg demand was “crazy,” echoing comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last week. Nvidia stock climbed more than 4% Tuesday, extending gains from yesterday when the company overtook Microsoft (MSFT) as America’s second-most valuable company. The stock, which closed just under $133 on Tuesday, is approaching its record closing high of $135.57, which was set on June 18. Nvidia's all-time intraday high, set on June 20, is $140.76. TradingView Nvidia shares have more than doubled this year after rebounding from a summer slump amid reports that a design flaw would delay the rollout of the Blackwell system. Those reports coincided with a sell-off of big tech stocks as earnings disappointed and Wall Street questioned the wisdom of massive AI spending. Update—October 8, 2024: This story has been updated to reflect Nvidia's share price at the market close on Tuesday.

Nvidia (NVDA) is best known for its highly coveted artificial intelligence chips. But at its Nvidia AI Summit in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, the Nvidia vice president of Enterprise Platforms, Bob Pette, delivered an address providing greater insights into the company’s various software platforms. Nvidia says companies ranging from AT&T (T), Deloitte, and Quantiphi to research centers like the National Cancer Institute and the SETI Institute are using its software technologies to do everything from helping employees work through software development and network engineering jobs to searching for signs of extraterrestrial life. Nvidia has a number of AI software platforms including Nvidia NIM Agent Blueprints, Nvidia NIM, and Nvidia NeMo. NIM Agent Blueprints is designed to help businesses develop generative AI applications, while NIM provides the ability to quickly put together chatbots and AI assistants. Nvidia NeMo gives companies the means to build their own custom generative AI models. Shares of Nvidia rose 3.7% following the announcement. The offerings are part of Nvidia’s strategy of ensuring that companies don’t just look to the company for AI processors but also for its software as well, driving additional revenue streams outside of hardware sales. According to Nvidia, AT&T is teaming with Quantiphi to create a conversational AI platform to assist employees with software development and financial services tasks. The University of Florida is using Nvidia’s NIM and MeMo to improve its learning management system for teaching assistants, and Deloitte is using Nvidia’s NIM Agent Blueprint alongside its own cybersecurity products. Nvidia says the National Cancer Institute is using NIM Agent Blueprint to help cut down on the time and cost of developing novel drug molecules, while the SETI Institute used the company’s Holoscan software development kit to create software for receiving and analyzing radio waves from space. Nvidia is also teaming with Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh as part of its new AI Tech Community initiative, establishing two new AI centers at the schools. The company says its Nvidia Joint Center with Carnegie Mellon University for Robotics, Autonomy, and AI will provide students, faculty, and researchers with technologies related to robotics and autonomy, while the Nvidia Joint Center with the University of Pittsburgh for AI and Intelligent Systems will revolve around AI focused on health sciences. Nvidia has developed the most sought-after AI chips in the world, which has sent its stock price skyrocketing a staggering 934% over the last two years. To put that in perspective, and maybe generate some envy, if you invested $10,000 in Nvidia in 2022, your stake would now be worth $103,400. But the company is facing increasing competition in the hardware space from longtime rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Nvidia’s own customers are also developing their own chips to power their AI software, which could cut into the company’s bottom line in the future. Nvidia’s endgame is to use software to hold on to its customers well into the future while providing recurring revenue streams. Highlighting its software also attracts developers to Nvidia’s offerings, and the more developers that build on Nvidia’s services, the more companies will seek out those platforms. Nvidia’s hardware lead isn’t going to disappear anytime soon, though. The company has been investing in AI technology for years, and it should continue to hold on to its competitive edge for some time. But by showing off its software, Nvidia is looking to prove it’s more than just a chip firm. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: One Wall Street Titan Thinks NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPU Production Volume Will Hit A Whopping 750K – 800K Units By Q1’25

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Over the past few weeks, the tech news airwaves have become literally choked with speculation surrounding the production cadence of NVIDIA's latest GPU architecture, dubbed Blackwell. While NVIDIA had already laid a lot of consternation to rest during its recent earnings call, when it confirmed that the architecture's minor design flaws were rectified via specific changes to the photomask, the true scale of the company's oncoming production ramp-up is only now becoming visible, with Morgan Stanley expecting a 3x jump in the Blackwell production volume between Q4'24 and Q1'25. As our discerning readers would remember, Morgan Stanley had penned an important note on NVIDIA back in September, noting among other things that the company was on course to ship 450,000 units of the Blackwell GPUs in the December-ending quarter, resulting in ~$10 billion in revenue. At the time, the Wall Street titan had conceded that NVIDIA was still in the process of resolving a few "technical challenges" with its GB200 server racks, positing a qualifier that such issues were a part of a "normal debugging process for new product launches." NVIDIA $NVDA Blackwell revenue could surpass Hopper as soon as Q1 2025, says Morgan Stanley: "According to our checks of the GPU testing supply chain, Blackwell chip output should be around 250-300k in Q4 2024, contributing $5-10 billion revenue for NVIDIA, which is still… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 8, 2024 Now, Morgan Stanley is out with a fresh investment note on NVIDIA, where the bank leverages its channel checks to confirm its earlier prognostication of between $5 billion and $10 billion in Blackwell-derived revenue for Q4'24. However, this time around, Morgan Stanley moves a step further by expounding on its thoughts for NVIDIA's first quarter of the calendar year 2025. Specifically, the Wall Street behemoth believes that NVIDIA will produce between 700,000 and 800,000 units of Blackwell GPUs in Q1'25, which corresponds to a 3x sequential increase in volumes: "And into 1Q25, we understand that Blackwell chip volume may reach 750k-800k units, up almost 3x from 4Q24." The bank goes on to note: "Meanwhile, we expect Hopper volume (including H200 and H20) to be around 1500k units in 4Q24, and gradually ramp down to 1000k units in 1Q25." Critically, given the fact that the B200 chip is priced at a 60 to 70 percent premium to the H200 chip, Morgan Stanley expects NVIDIA's Blackwell-derived revenues to exceed those related to its Hopper architecture in Q1'25.

US stocks opened higher on Tuesday as investors welcomed a pullback in surging oil prices, putting focus back on the ongoing debate over the economy and interest rates. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) stepped up around 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also rose about 0.5% as tech megacaps began to recoup some of the previous session's losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up roughly 0.3%. Stocks are set to pick up on the winning trend of recent months as Monday's headwinds ease, with oil prices retreating as Mideast tensions cool somewhat. Some "Magnificent 7" stocks were starting to regain ground lost amid negative headlines, with Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) all nudging slightly higher. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) built on a closing gain as the chip heavyweight's partner Hon Hai pointed to "crazy" AI demand. But the market is still grappling with busted hopes for jumbo interest-rate cuts, while lingering recession worries got a boost as China failed to deliver expected big stimulus on Tuesday. Stocks in Hong Kong (^HSI) slumped over 9%, as a roaring stimulus-fueled rally in Chinese stocks fizzled out.

Meanwhile, Fed governor Adriana Kugler said data will continue to drive rate decisions. Those comments sharpened investors' focus on the CPI inflation report due Thursday, which will provide further clues on the path forward for interest rates. In corporates, PepsiCo (PEP) got the ball rolling on earnings season, posting a surprise drop in quarterly revenue and lowering its forecast for 2024 sales growth. Shares of the snack and drinks giant slipped in early trading. US stocks opened higher on Tuesday after all three major indexes closed Monday's session in the red. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) each climbed around 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up roughly 0.3%. Oil prices, which have surged amid Middle East tensions, retreated early Tuesday. Crude oil (CL=F) fell about 3% to trade just below $75 a barrel. PepsiCo (PEP) lowered its sales outlook for the year, forecasting organic revenue growth in the low single digits below the previously expected 4% growth. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, PepsiCo's third-quarter revenue trailed behind Wall Street's estimates, coming in at $23.3 billion, versus the $23.8 billion expected. CEO Ramon Laguarta said in the release that Pepsi's performance was impacted by "subdued category performance trends in North America," the impact of recalls at Quaker Foods North America, and business disruptions from "rising geopolitical tensions in certain international markets." In a phone interview with Yahoo Finance, Laguarta said consumers are "very challenged" and they are making a "lot of trade-offs" when it comes to food. Those tradeoffs are weighing on the snacks business most acutely, Laguarta explained. PepsiCo shares dipped nearly 1% in pre-market trading. Read the full story here. Sign in to access your portfolio

PepsiCo (PEP) earnings come in below estimates and it cuts its full-year guidance; Honeywell (HON) will spin off its Advanced Materials division; a judge rules that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google must offer alternatives to its Play Store; Nvidia (NVDA) shares are rising after it overtakes Microsoft (MSFT) as the second-largest company by market capitalization; and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Big Deal Days kicks off as retailers look to grab consumers ahead of the holiday shopping season. Here's what investors need to know today. PepsiCo (PEP) shares are slipping about 1% in premarket trading after the soda giant reported third-quarter revenue of $23.32 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.13 that came in below expectations. "Given our performance to date and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect to deliver a low-single-digit increase in organic revenue (previously approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth)," PepsiCo Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ramon Laguarta said. PepsiCo's report comes after it warned about a weaker consumer in its prior-quarter report. Honeywell International (HON) will spin off its Advanced Materials division into a separate publicly traded company, the conglomerate said. According to The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the plan, the division could be worth more than $10 billion as a separately traded public company. Shares of Honeywell were roughly 2% higher in premarket trading. A U.S. judge has issued a permanent injunction that will force Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play Store on Android phones. The ruling comes from video game maker Epic Games' successful antitrust suit, which found that Google maintained illegal monopoly power in operating its app store. After declining about 2.5% Monday, Alphabet shares are up less than 1% in premarket trading. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) are gaining about 2% in premarket trading, a day after it overtook Microsoft (MSFT) in market capitalization to become the second-largest company in the world behind Apple (AAPL). Nvidia shares added 2% Monday, lifting the chipmaker's market cap to $3.13 trillion, as its partner Super Micro Computer (SMCI) reported strong shipments of its GPU processors used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Amazon (AMZN) will hold its Prime Big Deal Days today and tomorrow as retailers attempt to draw in consumers looking to get an early start on holiday shopping. Concurrently, Walmart (WMT) is running its Holiday Deals event from today through Sunday, while Target (TGT) is holding its second Circle Week of the year through Saturday. Shares of Amazon are higher by less than 1% in premarket trading, while Walmart and Target are little changed.

Title: Nvidia: What are investors are asking?

Investing.com -- Analysts at Citi have been on the road marketing in Boston and Europe, where they discussed with investors key topics regarding the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. According to the Wall Street firm, the company's AI adoption “remains in 3rd/4th innings as enterprise AI demand takes off next with AI agents.” Analysts expect Nvidia stock to remain range-bound through the CES event in early 2025 before new product launches, such as Blackwell GPUs, drive a sales and margin inflection. Citi notes that a recurring investor concern is Nvidia's gross margin trajectory. The bank predicts that gross margins will bottom out at around 72% in the January quarter, stabilizing in the mid-70s once the Blackwell series ramps up. Another focal point for investors is the competition between Nvidia’s GPUs and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). While ASICs can be advantageous for fixed-function applications, Nvidia GPUs offer versatility. As AI models expand, Nvidia's GPUs, which are capable of handling various applications, will likely see continued demand, analysts said. Moreover, enterprises favor multi-cloud strategies, and GPUs allow applications to run across different cloud platforms without rewriting. Citi also highlights that data center operators prioritize the total cost of ownership (TCO) and return on investment (ROI), areas where Nvidia continues to lead due to its ability to run diverse applications, including AI. “As NVDA runs various applications including AI, the data center operators rely on NVDA to have the hardware to run multiple applications rather than buying accelerators that are limited in their use cases,” analysts said in a Monday note. At the same time, investors are also keeping a close eye on Nvidia’s vertical integration strategy, which has progressed from chips to entire systems, a response to the slowdown of Moore’s Law. As for the Blackwell sales mix, the shift towards the GB200 format from the B100’s 8-GPU format is also expected to optimize TCO and ROI, Citi’s note states. Looking ahead, investors are optimistic about the long-term ROI, particularly with Nvidia’s emphasis on AI across large markets like social media and e-commerce. However, patience will be required as generative AI matures into disruptive business models. “We expect to see positive ROI data points next year led by GPU-as-a-service providers,” analysts said. With a Buy rating and a price target of $150, Citi remains bullish on Nvidia, with potential risks stemming from competition in gaming and possible market volatility in the auto and data center segments.

Nvidia's (NVDA) market capitalization overtook Microsoft's (MSFT) on Monday, making it the second-largest company in the world behind Apple (AAPL). Nvidia shares climbed just over 2% Monday, lifting the chipmaker's market cap to $3.13 trillion, ahead of Microsoft's $3.04 trillion. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a partner of Nvidia, reported strong shipments of its GPUs driven by artificial intelligence (AI) demand, helping send shares of both companies higher. Nvidia and Microsoft have been jockeying with Apple for the top spot by market cap in recent months. In June, Nvidia briefly took the crown when it surpassed Microsoft, but Microsoft later reclaimed the title, and Apple has since pulled ahead. Nvidia's stock price has more than doubled in value since the start of the year, as demand for its AI chips surged. Analysts suggested Nvidia shares could still climb higher, given the strength of AI spending trends and seasonal tailwinds. Semiconductor companies typically perform better in the fourth quarter than they do in the third quarter, with Nvidia “still set to lead," Melius Research analysts said Monday, adding "the setup here is still pretty darn good." Melius holds a price target of $165 for Nvidia, a 29% premium on Monday's closing price of $127.72. That compares to an average price target of $152.52, according to Visible Alpha.

AMD shares are more than 15% above where they started the year, though off the record levels set in March. Thirteen analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating on AMD stock, while three have a "hold" rating. AMD stock has an average target price of $190.56, meaning analysts broadly expect AMD shares will rise a further 11%. AMD closed Monday at just under $171 after changing only slightly tostart the week. The company's shares rose nearly 20% in the days following a similar event last December. Analysts have said they expect AMD to announce new products at the Thursday event, which could pave the way for it to gain market share in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator space as it faces off against Nvidia (NVDA), the industry leader. Analysts said the "AI ecosystems partners, customers and developers" that AMD mentioned in the event's announcement could include new customers—evidence of AMD's growing market share.

Title: Citi: NVIDIA To Remain Range-Bound Through The CES In January 2025, Margins To Bottom Out In Q1’25

Citi has penned an important investment note on NVIDIA today, touching on the stock's immediate prospects and the likely trajectory of the GPU manufacturer's margins as the Blackwell production ramp-up gets underway. Off the bat, Citi has asserted that NVIDIA's under-pressure gross margins will bottom out in the low-70s percents in Q1 2025, with the Wall Street titan continuing to view the ~72 percent level as the likely trough. After Q1, Citi expects NVIDIA's gross margins to stabilize in "the mid-70s%" as the Blackwell architecture ramps up. The bank notes: "While we are bullish on another strong +40% Y/Y cloud data center capex growth next year, we expect the stock to likely remain range bound through CES Jan before Blackwell driven Y/Y sales and gross margin inflection in the Apr-Q." On the topic of the GPU competition that is rapidly heating up, Citi perceives no immediate threat as NVIDIA's products currently lead the market on multiple metrics, including the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and the Return on Investment (ROI). The bank believes data centers prefer NVIDIA's GPUs for the flexibility that they offer: "As NVDA runs various applications including AI, the data center operators rely on NVDA to have the hardware to run multiple applications rather than buying accelerators that are limited in their use cases." According to the bank, an enterprise operating across multiple cloud-based platforms has to re-write its applications specific to every cloud operator, which poses a huge pain point. In contrast, "with NVDA GPUs, enterprises write their applications once as it will be transferable across clouds." What's more, NVIDIA's large installed base already constitutes a strong pull for developers, who desire "the largest possible adoption of their applications." On the topic of the Blackwell sales mix, Citi asserts that the GB200 chip will attract a greater proportion of orders from customers instead of the "B100’s 8-GPU format," owing to the former's favorable TCO and ROI metrics. In light of its positive - if a bit dampened - view on NVIDIA, Citi has maintained its Buy rating on the stock with a target of $150 per share.
