US stocks were muted on Wednesday as investors digested results from Morgan Stanley (MS) and others to potentially power a rebound to record highs after an ASML (ASML)-fueled slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were all near flat at the open. All three major gauges pulled back from all-time highs on Tuesday as ASML's deep cut to its 2025 sales forecast dented faith in the AI chip trade, driving down stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). Markets are on alert for any fresh news from ASML on the day the chip tool maker's apparently accidentally released earnings were scheduled to land. Morgan Stanley's quarterly report before the bell showed fresh signs of the Wall Street comeback that has boosted big bank earnings this week. Profits jumped compared to last year, thanks to a rise in dealmaking that has also lifted its peers. Shares rose more than 6% following the release. At the same time, disappointing earnings from ASML, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and luxury stalwart LVMH (MC.PA, LVMUY) have an otherwise bullish Wall Street on the lookout for signs of weakness elsewhere. Abbott (ABT), Alcoa (AA), and Discover Financial Services (DFS) are on the docket on Wednesday. In commodities, gold (GC=F) rallied toward a fresh record high as fresh tariff promises from Republican nominee Donald Trump added to uncertainty around the outcome of the tight US presidential race. Morgan Stanley (MS) stock jumped 4% at the open after the company reported large year-over-year increases across a variety of metrics in its third quarter earnings release. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Fees from investment banking jumped 56% from a year ago, the largest leap among big banks, to nearly $1.4 billion. The pick-up in investment banking and an increase in trading helped Morgan Stanley push its net profit up by 32% from a year earlier, to $3.2 billion. The results cement a broad rebound across the Wall Street operations of the country's biggest banks. Investment banking fees and equity trading revenue also jumped at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C). Read more here.

US stock futures took a breather on Wednesday as investors waited for results from Morgan Stanley (MS) and others to potentially power a rebound to record highs after an ASML (ASML)-fueled slide. Futures on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) hugged the flatline, while contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) were down 0.1%. All three major gauges pulled back from all-time highs on Tuesday as ASML's deep cut to its 2025 sales forecast dented faith in the AI chip trade, driving down stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). Markets are on alert for any fresh news from ASML on the day the chip tool maker's apparently accidentally released earnings were scheduled to land. Eyes are on Morgan Stanley's quarterly report before the bell for signs of the Wall Street comeback that has boosted big bank earnings this week. A strong showing would give weight to optimism that the US economy is headed for a "soft landing". At the same time, disappointing earnings from ASML, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and luxury stalwart LVMH (MC.PA, LVMUY) have an otherwise bullish Wall Street on the lookout for signs of weakness elsewhere.

Title: Tech is leading markets higher — but 3 other sectors have joined in: Morning Brief

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings There's no doubt that Big Tech is in the bull market's driver's seat — but it's got company. Though the major indexes are narrowly in the green this October, they have been boosted by third quarter earnings from Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which reported a big beat on investment banking fees. More significantly, the so-called "fins" have rallied alongside three others — tech, consumer discretionary, and industrials — to outperform the S&P 500 since the Japanese yen-induced panic of Aug. 5. All four sectors are up about 15%, with a slight edge to tech. (The low is important technically because it marks the bottom of the year's biggest decline — a quite normal 8.5%). It might seem familiar — and perhaps a bit unnerving — that "tech is leading" once again after the concentration hand-wringing over the "Magnificent Seven." But unlike other periods in this bull market — now two years old — tech has some company, thanks to money flowing, or rotating, into other sectors. It's a process as old as public markets. As the godfather of technical analysis, Ralph Acampora, CMT, famously quipped, "Sector rotation is the lifeblood of a bull market." Ralph's nephew, Jay Woods, who is an executive NYSE floor governor and chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, recently joined Stocks In Translation to break down the concept. "Money's not leaving the market, it's just going from one sector to the next to the next," said Woods, noting the strength in software stocks. He specifically highlighted cybersecurity plays like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Cisco (CSCO) — both damaged stocks at one time that are now leading. Woods reflects on Cisco's round-trip journey right back to its dot-com bubble highs. "I hate that I like Cisco right now," Woods said. "I liked it in '99, and it's right where it was trading in 1999. That's amazing." In fact, the tech sector leadership of today stands in stark contrast with earlier in the year, when the Mag Seven stocks dominated. Although perennial leader Nvidia (NVDA) is up 30% since the Aug. 5 low, IBM (IBM) is close on its heels — rising from its legacy tech ashes to fresh records. For that matter, more than 20 stocks in the S&P 500 are doing better than Nvidia since the yen low, led by electric power company Vistra Corp. (VST) and United Airlines (UAL) — up 85% and 70%, respectively. Many of these stocks are simply laggards that got beaten up in the 2022 bear market and left behind. But even among the overextended, there are still potential winners to be found. "Put up a five-year weekly chart in utilities for me. Talk about a nice rounded base and then a breakout," Woods said, adding, "[These are] not your grandparents' utilities anymore." On Yahoo Finance's podcast Stocks in Translation, Yahoo Finance editor Jared Blikre cuts through the market mayhem, noisy numbers, and hyperbole to bring you essential conversations and insights from across the investing landscape, providing you with the critical context needed to make the right decisions for your portfolio.

Title: Apple is losing out to Huawei in China. Here's why
URL: https://qz.com/apple-losing-huawei-china-smartphone-iphone-ai-market-1851672936
Time Published: 2024-10-16T09:00:00Z

Since releasing its Mate 60 Pro series last August, Chinese tech giant Huawei has made a comeback in China’s smartphone market, knocking Apple (AAPL) from its pedestal. Huawei and other homegrown smartphone makers have experienced double-digit growth this year, boosting smartphone shipments in China by 8.9% year-over-year in the second quarter, according to the International Data Corporation. China’s Vivo, Huawei, Oppo, Honor — a former subsidiary of Huawei — and Xiaomi made up the top sharers of China’s smartphone market, respectively. Apple, meanwhile, fell to sixth place. And despite cutting prices on some iPhone models to compete, the data showed Apple’s year-over-year sales declined 3.1%. Apple’s iPhone shipments in China experienced “marginal decline” in the second quarter of this year, Counterpoint Research said, noting that during the same period last year, Apple had the third-highest number of shipments — only behind Oppo and Vivo — while Huawei was in sixth place. Apple’s fall in China can be tied to many factors, experts said, including the country’s faltering economy and changes in how its citizens view their country versus the rest of the world amid the pandemic and the growing number of sanctions imposed by the West. “There’s a higher degree of nationalist sentiment right now within China, of buying local and buying the home team versus buying an American product,” Arthur Dong, professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Quartz. Since Huawei was placed on the U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 under former President Donald Trump, the company has faced increasingly tough trade restrictions under President Joe Biden — especially on the latest generation of semiconductors such as those from Nvidia (NVDA), Dong said. Escalating trade rules on China and Huawei are putting the tech company, which has ties to the Chinese government and which Dong called “a national champion for the Chinese economy,” “in a tough spot right now.” “Huawei is scrambling right now to try to find alternative sources for these all-important chips, as well as some very significant self-development efforts to try to replicate these technologies and build chips on their own,” Dong said. “With regard to that issue, China is having a really difficult time being able to replicate the chips that sort of fuel AI advancements simply because they don’t have access to the tools and the machinery that build these chips, all of which are within the confines of U.S. export controls.” Dong said he doesn’t see the current situation getting better for Huawei. With another round of restrictions expected over the next few months, the “gaps” that China and Huawei depend on to move around sanctions “are going to be closed,” he said. In the early 2010s, Apple was seen as a “legitimate, ultimate symbol of status,” Andy Tsay, professor of business and analytics at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business, told Quartz. Tsay, who is also a visiting professor in Peking University’s MBA program, said his friends in China would “place their orders” with him for iPhones because Apple’s products were more difficult to find there and there were shortages. Now, there are more Apple Stores in the country. “There really was no comparison, no competitor,” Tsay, who has visited China roughly every year since 2006, said. “Now, people still think Apple is a fine and legitimate luxury product. But the difference is, they’re not fanboys and fangirls anymore.” On his most recent visit to China a few months ago, Tsay asked his MBA students, part of China’s professional class, what they thought about their iPhones. While his students told him that they are satisfied with their iPhones, they also said their next phone “won’t necessarily be an Apple,” and that “there are some Chinese options that are pretty good.” “I’ll get whichever phone has the best price-to-benefit ratio,” Tsay’s students told him. In 2020, Huawei had 18% of the world market for smartphones, Dong said. Two years later, that number fell to 2%, largely because Huawei was restricted from necessary chips and components, he said, and he doesn’t see the company rebounding soon. “They’re still facing challenges in the Chinese market because the overall consumer economy of China has gone into a tailspin,” Dong said. “Apple’s problems are mostly related to the fact that the Chinese consumer has gone into hibernation and they can’t afford this kind of phone because their entire economy is, in a sense, collapsing.” Huawei’s growing sales are “only because their phones are a lot cheaper than Apple’s phones,” Dong said. If Huawei and other Chinese smartphone makers are offering cheaper alternatives, consumers will want those smartphones, he added. China is “more isolated” than it was during its superpower status in the 2010s, Tsay said, likely due to anti-Chinese sentiments stemming from the pandemic. Meanwhile, companies are “trying to extricate themselves from being too reliant on China,” and Western governments continue to ban China’s access to certain technologies, such as equipment to build advanced semiconductors. “You combine that all together with the rise of domestic products, and if people, locally, can feel a little bit good about themselves by supporting the home team, there’s a little bit of something in the trend,” Tsay said. There are two views of the AI chips in Huawei’s smartphones, Dong said. “On the one hand, it could send us an alarming signal that China has the ability to create their homegrown chips,” Dong said. “But there are other stories that you will see where these chips have been examined and the engineering analysis on them is that they’re not even close to the capabilities of what Nvidia is producing — that it’s actually several generations and years behind.” Despite Huawei’s “headline-grabbing” announcements about developing its own chips, Dong said he finds it difficult to imagine how the company has made its advanced chips without access to critical machines and components under trade restrictions. “This is perhaps more bark and less bite when it comes to this announcement that they have advanced-level chips,” Dong said. The competition between Apple and Huawei in China is also tied to the difference in what Apple can offer its U.S. consumers versus its Chinese consumers, Tsay said. Apple’s advantage in the U.S. is its control over its ecosystem, according to Tsay, allowing it to deliver a differentiated user experience. China, however, has a “unique situation” where its “version” of Apple’s iOS is WeChat. “You almost don’t need the tightly integrated, walled garden of the Apple ecosystem in China to deliver that experience because it already exists inside the WeChat world,” Tsay said. “That gives the local cell phone companies an advantage in the sense that they can use Android or their own version of Android or a brand new operating system — they don’t need to create that self-contained ecosystem that Apple has so painstakingly created over the years because Tencent (TCEHY) already did it for them by creating WeChat.” The one place the two companies differ, Tsay said, is with Apple’s security and privacy features. “Of course, nobody in China has any expectation of security and privacy when they are online,” he said.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) (TSMC) is expected to beat revenue expectations for the third quarter when it reports quarterly earnings Thursday. The Taiwanese chipmaker is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter. The company set its third-quarter guidance between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. Meanwhile, TSMC is expected to report $9.3 billion in net income for the third quarter, according to FactSet. The chipmaker’s shares were down 2.63% at the market close Tuesday. However, its stock is up 84.3% so far this year. TSMC announced net revenue of $7.82 billion for September — an increase of 0.4% from the previous month and an almost 40% increase year over year. Revenue for January through September grew 31.9% from the previous year, TSMC said. The chipmaker, which counts Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) as customers, has seen its sales climb amid the generative artificial intelligence boom. In July, TSMC beat analysts’ expectations for the second quarter, reporting revenue of $20.82 billion — up 40% from a year ago. Wendell Huang, the chief financial officer of TSMC, said in a statement that the company expects smartphone- and AI-related demand to drive business in the third quarter. C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, said he expects chip production to catch up to demand by 2025 or 2026. In August, TSMC reported revenue of NT$250.87 billion ($7.8 billion) — a 33% increase from the previous year. The company’s August sales were down 2.4% from July, which saw a 45% surge year over year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia Price Levels to Watch as Stock Retreats From Record

Time Published: 2024-10-16T02:32:16Z

Nvidia (NVDA) shares will likely remain on investors’ radar screens after falling sharply Tuesday, just a day after setting a record closing high. The decline Tuesday came as Bloomberg reported that the Biden Administration is mulling AI chip export curbs to some Middle Eastern countries. The news tempered optimism about surging demand for Nvidia's chips from tech giants hyperscaling their AI infrastructure amid a backdrop of tight supply. Nvidia shares fell 4.7% Tuesday to close at $131.60. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels that investors will likely be watching. Nvidia shares consolidated within a symmetrical triangle between June and September before breaking out above the pattern earlier this month. Although the breakout signals a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend, it’s worth pointing out that the move occurred on below-average volume, indicating a lack of conviction behind the move. Conversely, Tuesday’s selling registered the highest daily share turnover in nearly a month, raising the possibility of a potential bull trap, a trading event that lures investors into buying a breakout before the price makes a sudden reversal. Let’s take a look at three important support levels on the AI chipmaker’s chart and also use technical analysis to forecast a potential bullish price target above the stock’s all-time high (ATH). The first sits around $125, where the shares find a confluence of support from the symmetrical triangle’s top trendline and a horizontal line connecting a range of comparable trading levels on the chart between early June and late September. A decisive breakdown below this level would confirm a bull trap, which could trigger a move down to the $115 level, where the stock may encounter buying interest near the triangle’s lower trendline and multiple minor peaks and troughs stretching back to late May. Further selling could see the shares revisit major support around $97, a location on the chart currently just below the upward sloping 200-day moving average (MA) where investors could look for buying opportunities near the twin March peaks and prices situated just above the August low. Investors can forecast a bullish price target above the stock’s ATH by using a measured move, also referred to by chartists as the measuring principle. This works by calculating the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s trendlines near the start of the pattern and adding that amount to the breakout point. In other words, we add $50 to $127, which projects a price target of $177. The forecast, around 34% above Tuesday’s close, indicates a potential area on the chart where investors may be happy to lock in profits.

Title: Jim Cramer on NVIDIA (NVDA): ‘I Have Never Seen’ a Company With Such Demand for Its Products

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Jim Cramer during his October 14 program on CNBC looked excited as he celebrated the rebound of major tech stocks, saying these companies are showing their “staying power” despite the odds. “We’re back. That’s right. Whatever you want to call them, these big tech plays are demonstrating their staying power no matter what happens.” Cramer said that the latest earnings season would be critical for the overall market and investor portfolios. He also pointed out the broadening of the rally, saying other groups besides the tech industry are also rebounding. “This rally is not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can work, too, in this market. There’s a lot of money going around, and we know there’s a lot of money coming into the market. The Fed is cutting rates, and friendly cash won’t be worth as much as it was. But the staying power of the Magnificent 7 is truly unbelievable.” For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Talking about Nvidia in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer talked about the much-awaited Blackwell chips: “They are so powerful, so fast. These guys basically invented a chip that is so quick that it created the entire AI business out of thin air. It wasn’t possible before, but now it can do incredible things, and very soon it will be both faster and better.” Cramer also talked about the demand NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is seeing: “I’ve never seen a company have such demand for its products, including demand from Tesla, which needs NVIDIA for self-driving cars.” Nvidia’s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia. Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave. At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range. Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector. Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.” Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Chipmakers tumble as ASML forecast cut issues a growth warning to the sector
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chipmakers-tumble-asml-guidance-semiconductor-nvidia-chip-growth-2024-10

Semiconductor stocks fell Tuesday after ASML slashed guidance for next year, and as the sector mulled reports that the US was weighing a cap on chip exports from some American companies. ASML, Europe's most valuable tech company, plunged 16% in its biggest single-day drop since 1998. Other chip stocks followed, with NVDA dipping almost 5%, AMD falling 5.3%, and Broadcom tumbling 3.5% around midday Tuesday. SMCI, meanwhile, fell as much as 3.4% earlier in the day before paring most losses. The industry's downturn comes after ASML, a Dutch chip machine maker, posted a downbeat earnings report and cut its sales guidance for next year. The report's forward guidance lowered total net sales for 2025 to between €30 billion and €35 billion, the lower half of the previously stated range, citing weak demand from chipmakers for its machinery. "It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected. This is expected to continue in 2025, which is leading to customer cautiousness," CEO Christophe Fouquet said in a statement. ASML's third quarter bookings were €2.6 billion, coming in under half the average estimate of €5.39 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey. The report was posted a day earlier than expected, adding to the surprise of the results and lower guidance. Flows into AI stocks slowed over the summer as investors expressed worries about returns on huge spending on AI. Investment in the sector has rebounded in recent weeks, though, propelling Nvidia to a fresh high on Monday to help the S&P 500 hit another record close. Reports that the US is weighing a cap on chip exports from American chipmakers only compounded the industry's tumultuous start to the week. According to Bloomberg, the Biden administration has been in talks to cap sales of advanced AI chips from some American chip companies—including Nvidia—to certain countries in order to protect national security. The plans would likely target Persian Gulf countries, which are increasingly interested in AI, sources told the outlet, and would build on existing restrictions that originally set out to curb China's progress in AI. Previously implemented restrictions have regulated chip shipments to over 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia to prevent chip technology from flowing to China.

The Dow and other major indexes experienced losses Tuesday afternoon as chipmakers struggled amid news of potential export caps. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 118 points, or 0.28%, to 42,939. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 shed 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. Shares of Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML (ASML) plummeted following the company’s disappointing third-quarter bookings and a downward revision of its 2025 guidance. During afternoon trading, ASML’s stock dropped by more than 16%, reflecting investors’ concerns about the company’s outlook. “While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” CEO Christophe Fouquet said in the company’s earnings report. “It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.” ASML is the only company in the world that makes the equipment needed for advanced chip manufacturing, and nearly half of ASML’s revenue for the second quarter came from sales to China. However, due to export restrictions from the U.S. and the Netherlands, the company is now facing a more challenging business outlook in China. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) fell over 5% Tuesday, a day after after closing at a record high. The chipmaker’s stock was down less than 1% in pre-market trading, but had fallen by about 5% by midday. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported. Among major semiconductor stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell by 4.9%, Micron Technology (MU) declined by 3.5%, and Broadcom (AVGO) decreased by 3.5% on Tuesday. –Britney Nguyen contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Nvidia(NVDA, Financial) ended at an unprecedented high on Monday, bringing it within close distance of Apple (AAPL,Financial) as the most valuable company in the world. The economic value of Nvidia is at $3.39 trillion and thus, it is behind Apple's $3.52 trillion only, but ahead of Microsoft's $3.12 trillion. This jump attests to solid investors' belief in Nvidia's present and future AI chip products. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Earlier this year, Nividia briefly surpassed Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) to become the world's most valuable company. Nevertheless, the tech giants have since repositioned themselves thoroughly, and their market caps bounced around with more fluctuation for several more months. Indeed, Wall Street has placed Nvidia among critical contenders for the position of the market leader for next-gen AI tech, manufacturers of which include Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial), Amazon (AMZN, Financial), and Microsoft. TD Cowen analysts indicate that the investment environment in the AI space is competitive and calls for more Australia's needs to invest continuously, which investment is critical in preparing for potential obstacles in the burgeoning field. Nvidia expects further sales growth even if it experiences a production slowdown of the Blackwell chips it is expected to release. Sales of other chips for artificial intelligence deployments are expected to remain steady at least. TD Cowen has placed Nvidia as their Top Pick for investment, and the firm reaffirms its price target of $165. Before the reporting season starts emotions are also rather high: both Apple and Microsoft have increased their movements which led to S&P 500 record. Nvidia along with companies like Apple and Microsoft jointly hold appreciable weight at the S&P 500. As we look ahead, Nvidia has forecasted revenue surge to almost $125.8 billion thanks to continued investments in AI data centres, according to LSEG data. Still, there is some wariness regarding the further stable growth of AI spending. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell from yesterday's all-time closing high, and shares of other chipmakers declined, following indications the Biden administration is considering limiting the export of artificial intelligence chips to some countries in the Middle East. Bloomberg reported that White House officials have discussed putting a cap on export licenses to certain nations because of national security concerns. The focus was on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing interest in AI and the funding to purchase those technologies, the report said, adding that the discussions are in the early stages. Also weighing on semiconductor stocks was a warning from chipmaker equipment ASML Holding (ASML), which released its third quarter earnings a day earlier than expected. "While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover," said CEO Christophe Fouquet. "It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.” ASML predicted 2025 sales of EUR30 billion to EUR35 billion ($32.7 billion to $38.1 billion), which is in the lower half of the range of its previous guidance. New York-traded shares of ASML sank some 16%, pulling them into the red for the year. The PHLX index of semiconductor stocks fell more than 4%. Nvidia's shares were down nearly 5%, though they remain up more than 160% in 2024. TradingView

Title: Nvidia stock tumbles from record high on news of possible US chip export cap, ASML's dismal earnings

Nvidia (NVDA) stock sank 4.5% Tuesday, partially reversing its two week-rally and coming down from a record close the day before. The stock's tumble began before the market opened in response to a Bloomberg report that Biden administration officials are considering capping US chip exports to certain countries. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that potential regulations would focus on Persian Gulf countries in the interest of national security. The stocks of fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) also fell on the news. Intel declined to comment on the report. Nvidia and AMD did not immediately respond to requests from Yahoo Finance. "While NVDIA has not disclosed its sales to the Gulf region, the level of investment in AI from that region has been very substantial," DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance. "More importantly, if the government continues to narrow the geographies chip companies can sell into, they are significantly narrowing the market for AI services for NVDIA customers Microsoft, Google and Amazon." Adding to the woes of chip stocks Tuesday was a dismal earnings report from semiconductor equipment supplier ASML (ASML). The Dutch company — which sells equipment to Nvidia's chip manufacturer TSMC as well as Intel — reported booking orders worth just €2.6 billion ($2.8 billion) for the third quarter, far lower than the €5.39 billion forecast by Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The PHLX Semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 5.3% Tuesday, far underperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which was down 0.7% at market close. Nvidia’s decline Tuesday partially reverses a two-week winning streak that saw the stock rally to a new record closing price Monday, nearly eclipsing Apple (AAPL) as Wall Street’s most valuable company. Shares closed above $138 Monday, ahead of its previous record of $135.58 in June. Nvidia's tear was fueled by industry leaders' comments about intense demand for its AI chips and renewed bullishness over AI. Nvidia stock has been more volatile since its 10-for-1 stock split in June, and news of heightened trade tensions focused on the AI chip sector — which Nvidia leads — has pushed shares down various times over the past two years. For example, Nvidia shares experienced a similar decline this time last year — when the Biden administration tightened export controls on US chips — before extending its historic rally. Despite Tuesday’s decline, Nvidia shares are up 190% from last year. While demand for its AI chips is strong in the near term, a potential slowdown in AI spending by Big Tech companies is another cause for concern to investors, in addition to geopolitical risks. DA Davidson's Gil Luria recently told Yahoo Finance that AI spending could ease as soon as 2025, which would be bad news for Nvidia shares. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Title: Alibaba Still Has Room to Run: How China’s Stimulus Drives Growth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/10/15/alibaba-still-has-room-to-run-how-chinas-stimulus-drives-growth/

By Muslim Farooque Summary Chinese eCommerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Financial) has been on a superb run over the past six months, gaining upwards of 49% in value. After a sluggish phase from late 2020 through 2023, Alibaba stock is finally hitting its stride, showcasing healthy momentum as it climbs back to its pre-pandemic highs. Naturally, with its impressive rally, many are concerned about whether Alibaba stock has run too far. Given the tailwinds in play, spearheaded by the likely boost from China's massive stimulus plan, there still appears to be significant growth potential for the stock ahead. The dramatic shifts in China's monetary policy of late, led by unexpected interest rate cuts and a dovish stance, have fueled a superb rally in Chinese equities. Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People's Bank of China, announced sweeping economic measures, including reducing the 7-day reverse repo rate from 1.7% to 1.5%. With a firmer commitment to rejuvenating China's economic landscape, Chinese stocks have been running hot of late. In fact, Chinese stocks recorded their highest gains since 2008 in the past couple of weeks. The SPDR S&P China ETF (GXC SPDR S&P China ETF ), for instance, has outperformed the S&P 500 by a sizeable margin. Over the past month, GXC stock has climbed more than 20%, comfortably beating the S&P 500's gain, showcasing its sustained bullish momentum in response to the economic stimulus. Consequently, analysts are finally bullish on Chinese stocks. David Chao of Invesco Asset and Raymond Chen from ZiZhou Investment Asset Management expects strong fiscal measures to sustain the rally. Additionally, Laura Wang of Morgan Stanley sees a potential 10% short-term gain for the CSI 300 Index, indicating a marked shift in market sentiment, primarily due to the recent economic stimulus. Since November 2020, when the Chinese government initiated a rigorous regulatory crackdown on major tech companies, Chinese tech stocks have been suppressed. Following the high-profile suspension of Ant Group's IPO, the landscape from 2020 to 2023 marked a major cooling period for the sector, marked by a focus on antitrust, data security, and financial regulations. However, the recent economic changes aimed at stabilizing the Chinese property industry signal a pivotal shift. These interventions will likely alleviate major economic pressures, boost business conditions, and increase consumer spending power. Moreover, as we head toward late 2024, the strategic focus on economic revitalization could potentially lead to superb gains for Chinese stocks, especially Alibaba. It's important to note that from September 2014 to January 2020, Alibaba stock experienced a remarkable rise of 122%, hitting a high of $231. This period marked a golden era of growth for Chinese tech, supported by expansionary supportive government policies. Alibaba has quickly become one of the top AI players, arguably the biggest long-term catalyst in driving the company's growth and enhancing its global footing. Through its Qwen AI model, it has cemented its position as one of the giants in the international AI landscape, going head-to-head with top models like OpenAI's GPT and others. Furthermore, the tech giant's recent partnerships with industry bellwethers like Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) and Mastercard (MA, Financial) showcase its AI-powered capabilities, including autonomous mobility. The integration of its AI model with Nvidia's Drive AGX Orin platform, perhaps one of the most promising future sectors, bolsters its appeal as an AI play. Also, Qwen's link to AliAlibaba's own mammoth platforms like Taobao and DingTalk, each with north of 600 million active users, underscores the powerful, robust infrastructure Alibaba has built to support its AI-driven services. Most recently, the company released more than 100 open-source AI models, having released its powerful text-to-video tool at its Apsara Cloud event. Also, a potential partnership with Apple to integrate AI adds new layers to Alibaba's growth story, fortifying its credentials in the niche. Hence, the company's comprehensive AI strategy isn't just about its current operations but is also strategically positioning it for substantial future growth. Despite some inconsistency in top-line growth over the past few years, Alibaba's robust profitability numbers continue to impress. Alibaba Profitability Rank As depicted in the visual, Alibaba attracts a superb 8 on 10 rating from GuruFocus, underscoring its robust bottom-line health compared to sector benchmarks. Starting with its gross margin stands at an impressive 37.9%, highlighting its ability to maintain healthy profits relative to sales. Moreover, its operating margin is solid at 12.12%, indicating efficient management operations despite operating in a competitive landscape. However, its net margin stands at 7.36% while its ROA is at 3.9%, suggesting that while Alibaba is profitable, there are areas where it needs to step up its game with regard to efficiency in turning assets into net income. Also, its FCF margin of 18% is commendable, reflecting robust cash generation capabilities that remain critical in sustaining operations and funding future expansions. Moreover, Alibaba's ROC ( Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio)) is at 57.3%, dramatically outperforming many of its competitors, highlighting its effectiveness in generating returns from capital investments. Additionally, with 10 consecutive years of profitability, Alibaba's financial stability has shielded it from previous crises, positioning it to thrive in the competitive landscape. A huge part of Alibaba's margin growth has been the expansion of its Cloud business, which is emerging as a key growth engine for Alibaba. Despite a challenging retail environment in China and a brief dip in cloud sales last year, the integration of advanced AI technologies has revitalized this segment, driving a strong rebound in recent results. Alibaba Cloud Revenue From the chart above we can see that Alibaba Cloud has shown impressive growth over the years, as shown by its revenue trajectory from 2018 to 2023. Despite a sizeable dip in 2023, the cloud division's rapid expansion from $2,135 million in 2018 to a peak of $11,763 million in 2022 highlights its expanding influence within Alibaba. Moreover, as per recent financials, Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence Group contributes significantly to sales, which accounts for 11.3% of the pie, underscoring the cloud sector's expanding influence. Alibaba Income Statement Breakdown Chart Also, from the graphic above, it's clear that the company draws sales from an array of sources. Though it still generates the lion's share of sales from Taobao and Tmall Group at 46.2%, other segments collectively contribute over 30%, which is imperative in stabilizing the company's financials against sector-specific downturns while helping to capitalize on multiple growth avenues. In its most recent showing in Q2 2024, Alibaba Cloud grew superbly, with segment-wise revenue reaching $3.64 billion, marking a 6% increase YOY. This growth is propelled by AI-driven products, reflecting a powerful demand in the AI sector, which Alibaba is tapping into. Also, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu emphasized the pervasive impact of AI on the cloud division's future, projecting double-digit growth in the latter half of 2024. Hence, the substantial investments in AI and cloud infrastructure that Alibaba has been making signal its intent to accelerate this momentum, ensuring its competitive edge in a fast-evolving digital landscape. Alibaba's stock performance has demonstrated superb gains over the past year, with stellar gains across various timeframes. Over the past month and three months, Alibaba has achieved healthy returns of more than 27% and 47%, respectively, outpacing its competition in PDD and MELI over the short term. Despite the challenges over the past three to five years, the tailwinds propelling Alibaba suggest it is positioned excellently to maintain its growth and continue delivering substantial returns for its investors. Alibaba Annualized Return Comparison Table Furthermore, based on the 12-month price target chart for Alibaba points to a consensus target of $108.40, with a potential increase of 2.15%. It's important to note that projections range significantly, with a $146 high estimate and a low of $79.70. Despite the volatility expected in Alibaba stock, I expect favorable market tailwinds to continue driving more upside as optimism in Chinese equities continues moving from strength to strength. Alibaba Analyst Price Targets Furthermore, if we look at the value of Alibaba stock based on the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, we see that there's still plenty of upside left in the stock. The DCF analysis is based on the company's TTM free cash flow (FCF) per share, projecting a fair value of $146.07, which is significantly above the current stock price. This indicates a margin of safety of more than 26%. Additionally, the model includes key variables including a 10% discount rate, reflecting the risk and time value of money. Also, the analysis is broken down into the growth and terminal stages. For the growth stage, a 10-year period is assumed with an annual growth rate of 8.3%, which amounts to a growth value of $86.28. For the terminal stage, also spanning 10 years, a lower growth rate of 4% results in a terminal value of $59.8. Given the sizeable margin of safety, there is hefty opportunity for capital appreciation, which shows that Alibaba stock's current price may not fully reflect its future cash flow potential, making it an attractive value investment. Alibaba DCF Model Chart Despite the run-up in value, I expect Alibaba stock to continue rising in value on the back of multiple tailwinds. Perhaps the biggest boost the stock is centered around China's economic stimulus measures, that led to a broader rally in Chinese equities. Moreover, Alibaba's inroads in the AI realm and cloud business expansion bolster its growth prospects further. Also, despite past challenges, Alibaba will likely continue sustaining its momentum with key drivers like cloud growth, AI innovations, and higher consumer spending. Also, a DCF analysis based on realistic assumptions points to a fair value of $146.07, implying a strong margin of safety and capital appreciation potential. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Investor sentiment sees biggest jump since June 2020 but offers a sign of caution
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investor-sentiment-sees-biggest-jump-since-june-2020-but-offers-a-sign-of-caution-150423806.html

Investor sentiment saw its largest jump in nearly four years during October amid resilient economic data and the start of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. In Bank of America's October Global Fund Manager Survey, investor sentiment rose to a reading of 5.6 from 3.8, marking its largest one-month increase since June 2020. The broad measure of sentiment takes into account investors' allocations to cash and equities as well as their economic growth expectations. Allocations to bonds and cash plunged in October, according to BofA's survey, as investors appeared more confident in the economic outlook. The drop in cash allocations fell to a level that BofA noted is often a near-term "sell signal." But when looking at other broad measures, the firm's "big sell signal" hasn't been triggered yet. The survey of 195 global participants was conducted from Oct. 4 to Oct. 10. The first day of responses was on the same day the blowout September Jobs report helped quell recession fears. Just 8% of respondents said they see a "hard landing" for the global economy over the next 12 months. That marked the lowest level of respondents fearing a situation where restrictive central bank policy leads to an economic downturn in four months. The optimism from investors reflects the recent market action. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) have both surged, hitting several record highs, including closing at all-time highs on Monday. Artificial intelligence market leader Nvidia (NVDA) closed at its first record high since June on Monday. More speculative areas have rallied too, with cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) both gaining more than 5% on Monday. Tuesday's Bank of America Survey did come with a sign of caution though, as hyper-optimistic investors can sometimes be considered a sign of a near-term top in the market. Cash allocations among respondents fell to 3.9% in October. Bank of America noted that any reading under 4% can be considered a "sell signal." Since 2011, the worldwide equity index iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) has declined by 2.5% on average in the one-month period following sell signals and fallen 0.8% over the next three months, per BofA. Still, there are plenty on Wall Street who think optimism among investors has further to run before the current bull market rally hits a true bump in the road. "We are in 'goldilocks zone', where investors are rightly trying to pick winners and avoid losers but are not so optimistic that they have thrown caution to the wind," DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday when making the case for the stock market rally to keep rising higher.

Title: Nvidia stock falls over 4% on news that U.S. could cap exports

Time Published: 2024-10-15T15:03:00Z

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) fell over 5% Tuesday, a day after after closing at a record high. The chipmaker’s stock was down less than 1% in pre-market trading, but had fallen by about 5% by midday. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported. Earlier this year, U.S. officials started slowing down the issuing of licenses to Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. chipmakers for shipping large-scale AI accelerators to the Middle East, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, Dell (DELL) plans to ship computer servers with Nvidia’s Blackwell AI chips to select customers starting next month, with general availability slated for the start of next year, Arthur Lewis, president of Dell’s infrastructure unit, told Bloomberg. Dell’s rollout shows production of Nvidia’s highly-anticipated Blackwell chips is on track after reports of delays earlier this year. Nvidia’s shares have experienced some turbulence in recent months. In August, the chipmaker’s shares fell about 13% in pre-market trading after a report that its Blackwell chips were delayed due to design flaws. Still, Nvidia’s stock is up around 173% so far this year, and it remains the second-most valuable public company after Apple (AAPL). The company’s shares climbed 2.4% and closed at a record $138.07 on Monday, beating its previous record close of $135.58 on June 18 — a week after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. During Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings in August, CEO Jensen Huang said the company had shipped samples of Blackwell chips to customers during the period and that Blackwell’s production will ramp up in the fourth quarter into fiscal year 2026. To “improve production yield,” Nvidia made a change to Blackwell’s GPU mask, the chipmaker said. However, “there were no functional changes necessary,” Huang said on a call with analysts. Earlier this month, Nvidia’s stock rose after chief executive Jensen Huang said demand for Blackwell is “insane.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The U.S. reportedly could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries, including those in the Middle East. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The Biden administration’s focus is reportedly on countries in the Middle East that have started pouring billions into AI data centers. A ceiling on export licenses would follow the Commerce Department’s recent expansion of its license exceptions to include data centers. The license exception makes it easier for U.S. companies to send AI chips to countries building data centers in the Middle East. Earlier this year, U.S. officials started slowing down the issuing of licenses to Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. chipmakers for shipping large-scale AI accelerators to the Middle East, Bloomberg reported. U.S. officials were also reportedly carrying out a national security review of AI technology being developed in the region. Nvidia and the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which is responsible for export controls, both declined Quartz’s request for comment. AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In June, Saudi Arabia announced its National Semiconductor Hub to develop semiconductor companies that can design new chips. The kingdom said it wants to attract 50 firms to Saudi Arabia by 2030. However, the hub is currently focused on simple chips, not advanced chips for AI and military technology, Bloomberg reported. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which has investments in U.S. tech startups, has set aside $40 billion to invest in AI technology, the New York Times reported earlier this year. The fund is reportedly working with top U.S. investors, including Andreessen Horowitz. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Stock futures are little changed Tuesday, a day after the Dow and S&P 500 set fresh record highs and investors await a slew of corporate earnings reports; shares of chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel (INTC) are dropping on a report that U.S. regulators are looking to curb sales of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled chips to some Middle East countries; Bank of America (BAC) third-quarter earnings come in ahead of estimates; Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google says it will back construction of small nuclear plants by a startup in a bid to meet AI power demands; and Apple Q3 smartphone sales grow following its iPhone 16 release. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are little changed Tuesday, a day after the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average set fresh record highs as tech stocks helped lead gains. After several big banks reported better-than-expected earnings last week, investors will get another slate today, including from Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Bond markets will return to trading today after being off for the Columbus Day federal holiday Monday. After hitting an all-time closing high yesterday, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are pulling back less than 1% in premarket trading after a Bloomberg report that the U.S. is weighing curbs on exports of artificial intelligence (AI) chips to some countries. The sales cap would likely be targeted toward countries in the Middle East and comes as U.S. regulators are working to ease the licensing process for shipments to data centers in that region, the report said. The news sent shares of other chipmakers lower as well, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Bank of America (BAC) shares are rising more than 2% in premarket trading after it reported third-quarter results above analysts' estimates. The lender posted $25.34 billion in revenue, above last year's $25.17 billion, and profit that fell to $6.90 billion from $7.80 billion—a smaller drop than the consensus projection of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha. Bank of America joined rivals JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) in reporting better-than-expected Q3 results. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google said it would back the construction of nuclear power plants as the tech giant looks for power sources for its AI services. Google will buy power from startup Kairos Power, which is planning to generate 500 megawatts of power, with the reactor slated to be online by 2030, followed by others through 2035. The arrangement comes as tech firms search for additional energy sources to power AI data centers, with Microsoft (MSFT) recently announcing it would restart a reactor at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island to help meet power needs. Google shares are rising less than 1% in premarket trading. Sales of Apple (AAPL) smartphones rose in the third quarter following the release of its AI-enabled iPhone 16 last month, according to a report from International Data Corporation. Industry tracking data showed that iPhone sales were higher by 3.5% year-over-year, with sales strong for both older models and the latest iPhone release, with the company maintaining a steady market share of 17.7%, IDC said. Apple's 56 million worldwide shipments weren't enough to make it the top seller, though, as Samsung delivered 57.8 million phones to capture 18.3% of the smartphone market. Apple shares are about 1% higher in premarket trading.

Title: How To Play China’s New Stimulus Package With Closed-End Funds

Made in China. When I show you a chart like the one below, your first thought might be that we’re looking at, say, the recent stock performance of NVIDIA (NVDA)—or maybe a biopharma firm that just dropped a breakthrough treatment: MCHI Total Returns But you’d be wrong. What we’re looking at here is the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI), an index fund tracking the Chinese stock market, up to its peak early last week. That jump is the direct result of the Chinese Communist Party’s recently announced stimulus package. The gains have attracted the attention of Chinese day traders and speculators, as well as those in the West. But—as is often the case with China’s economic moves—there’s still a lot of uncertainty here, as the Chinese government has given few details on what, exactly, it will do. That lack of detail caused a reversal late last week that has dented, but not shattered, the bullish view. So how do us non-day traders profit from this situation? The obvious way is to buy Chinese stocks—but there’s a big risk here, since foreigners can’t do this directly. There are ways around this, such as buying US-listed firms like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA). But that adds risk, since stocks like these don’t actually give you ownership in Chinese companies. This all may sound surprising if you don’t follow Chinese stocks regularly, but Alibaba and other US-listed Chinese stocks are actually tied to something called a variable interest entity that’s registered in the Cayman Islands. So buying Alibaba isn’t just a bet on Chinese stimulus but also on Chinese regulators respecting international law and recognizing foreign investors’ real claim in Chinese firms. Another way to buy in is through an ETF like MCHI, which invests broadly in Chinese assets, and hope you can get out before this short-term frenzy stops. However, MCHI and ETFs like it aren’t your only option, nor are they even a particularly good one. The real problem with Chinese stocks is that, while short-term wins on a frenzy like this are possible, the Chinese market’s long-term performance has been, to put it frankly, dreadful. MCHI Lags Chinese stocks have returned around a tenth of the S&P 500’s gains, so an investor who bought $10,000 of US stocks in 2011 would have $56,120 as of this writing, while the same amount in Chinese stocks would now be $13,026, leaving over $40,000 on the table. The key takeaway here is that if you want to play this frenzy, don’t stick around long, or you’ll miss bigger returns elsewhere. But if you’re still determined to give it a try, MCHI isn’t the best way to do so. To explain this, let’s look at the Morgan Stanley China A Share Fund (CAF), a closed-end fund (CEF) that, like MCHI, invests in Chinese companies. CAF Lags As you can see, CAF is underperforming MCHI this year, and the pullback in the wake of the big spike we talked about off the top has been much worse for the CEF than it has been for the ETF. So why would an investor looking to profit off the Chinese stimulus package pick CAF? The answer is in the question itself. The frenzy has pushed up MCHI, the largest ETF by market cap tracking the Chinese stock market, but it still hasn’t spread to smaller, less-popular Chinese funds. And since CAF, with just a $275-million market cap, is about one-twentieth the size of MCHI, it’s probably going to remain a hidden gem of Chinese stock-market frenzy for a while longer. That may sound speculative. After all, how can I know that CAF isn’t getting as much attention as MCHI? Well, beyond its lagging performance, there’s the discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of CAF’s underlying portfolio): CAF Discount NAV Let’s start with the purple line above: MCHI trades at a 0.6% premium to NAV as of this writing. That shouldn’t happen. Typically, market pros look for opportunities to sell an ETF trading at a premium and buy the fund’s underlying assets, as doing so gives them instant profit. This is why big index funds, like S&P 500 ETFs, always trade close to par. This premium tells us that the difficulty of getting real shares in Chinese companies has made this arbitrage opportunity tough for all but the biggest investors. That should encourage more speculators to buy CAF, with its 17.2% discount (discounts to NAV are common with CEFs, since their shares are mostly fixed in number, while the value of the assets their shares represent fluctuates during trading hours). Bear in mind, too, that CAF is trading at a similar discount to where it was before the trading frenzy. That means CAF doesn’t have the big China stimulus–driven recovery priced in, while MCHI does. Of course, buying CAF means you’ll need to be active, vigilant and ready to sell at a moment’s notice. But that’s all part of day trading. This is also why we prefer a longer-term, dividend-focused approach at my CEF Insider service (as well as downplaying or avoiding Chinese stocks). After all, when there are CEFs from across the economy (and the world) yielding 8%+ on average, there’s just no need to take on the stress and workload of day trading.

Title: Nvidia and other chip stocks surge with no sign of AI spending slowdown — for now

Nvidia's (NVDA) record close on Monday comes as AI hardware stocks continue a recent tear fueled by investor enthusiasm over surging artificial intelligence demand. Nvidia shares are up 8% from last week, pushing the chipmaker closer to unseating Apple (AAPL) as Wall Street's most valuable company. The stock's rally follows recent comments from CEO Jensen Huang and the chipmaker's partners touting an intense need for the company's AI chips. Other AI chip and hardware stocks Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB), and Micron (MU) have risen, too, as the companies have given separate indications of strong demand for their products, thanks to the AI boom. TSMC (TSM) stock also closed at a record high Monday. All in all, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) is up 4.5% over the past five days, outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which rose 2.9% over the same time frame. The upward trajectory of AI chip stocks is a positive sign for AI hardware spending that assuages Wall Street’s concerns of a near-term slowdown on investment. "While Phase 2 stocks [i.e. AI infrastructure-related stocks, such as Arm, TSMC, and SMCI] appear modestly expensive relative to history, it is possible that the demand for AI leads the mega-cap tech stocks to spend even more on AI-related capex than investors and analysts currently expect," Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts wrote in their report on Oct. 10. Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) have all indicated that they will continue to spend large sums on AI infrastructure through next year, to the benefit of AI hardware companies, led by Nvidia. As a whole, mega-cap tech companies are set to spend $215 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2024 and $250 billion in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs. OpenAI’s recent $6.6 billion funding round is also expected to put cash in the hands of hardware companies — namely Nvidia — as it continues evolving its AI models. JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Harlan Sur sees revenues for the semiconductor industry growing 6% to 8% in 2024. “We remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks,” he said in a recent note to investors, “as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25.” A slowdown in investment will eventually come, though. The question is when. Whereas AI software is typically offered on a subscription basis, hardware is a one-time sale. Analysts have warned that AI chip stocks are in a bubble that will eventually burst once Big Tech’s massive spending on AI infrastructure eases. Indeed, tech giants' most recent earnings reports put on display a widening gap between their hefty spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure and their return on investment — and tested Wall Street’s thinning patience. The stocks of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all fell late this summer following their quarterly financial reports, which showed billions in AI spending. “We continue to believe that spending on data center infrastructure will be strong this year and possibly into next year,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email, “but that there is an eventual peak of capex spending by the hyperscalers, as early as next [calendar] year.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher in the first session of the new trading week as tech gains helped pushed major indexes to new highs, with earnings season set to pick up steam later in the week. The S&P 500 advanced 0.8% on Monday, adding to the benchmark index's all-time high Friday for a second straight record close. The Dow was up 0.5%, closing above the 43,000 level for the first time, and the Nasdaq gained 0.9%. Shares of power generator Vistra (VST) jumped 5.6% on Monday to notch the best daily performance of any S&P 500 constituent after BNP Paribas initiated coverage on the stock with an "outperform" rating. BNP also established a price target of $230 on Vistra shares, representing upside potential of around 74% from Monday's close. Vistra surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) last month as the S&P 500's top performer for 2024, riding a wave of enthusiasm around the company's opportunity to provide nuclear-generated power for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. It was also a strong day for semiconductor stocks, with shares of AI darling Nvidia reaching an all-time high after several bullish comments from Wall Street analysts. Citi analysts said yesterday Nvidia is “still king” when it comes to its client base in the AI accelerator market, and that its GPU sales to hyperscalers like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (MSFT) could double this year. Shares of Amentum (AMTM), which began trading last month following a spinoff from the engineering and construction firm Jacobs Solutions (J), were up 5.5%. The gains on Monday came after Truist initiated coverage of Amentum shares with a "buy" rating and $31 price target, suggesting over 9% upside as the company could outperform cost-savings forecasts. Shares of discount retailer Dollar General (DG) dropped 3.3%, marking the heaviest losses in the S&P 500 on Monday. Investment management firm Heartland Advisors published a report pinpointing Dollar General as one of the weakest-performing stocks in its midcap value fund during the third quarter. Shares of competitor Dollar Tree (DLTR) ended the session 3.1% lower. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) shares sank 3%. The downturn reversed a portion of the strong gains posted by the stock last week after RBC Capital analysts included CrowdStrike stock among their top picks in the software space, contending that the cybersecurity firm is successfully navigating the fallout from an incident in July when a malfunctioning software update caused extensive tech outages. However, CrowdStrike still faces potential repercussions from the incident. In its earnings report released last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL) cited the negative impact of the outage and said the carrier continues to seek compensation from the cybersecurity firm. Arch Capital Group (ACGL) shares slipped 2.9% after the specialty insurer announced a shakeup of its executive team. The company tapped Nicolas Papadopoulo to step into the chief executive officer (CEO) role and join the board of directors, effective immediately. Papadopoulo takes the reins from retiring CEO Marc Grandisson, who held the position since 2018. Shares of lithium producer Albemarle (ALB) fell 2.4% on Monday. The British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) announced last week that it would acquire Albemarle competitor Arcadium Lithium (ALTM) in an all-cash deal worth $6.7 billion. Albemarle was reportedly on Rio Tinto's radar as a potential takeover target before the multinational miner decided on Arcadium.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose again Monday in the wake of bullish comments from Wall Street analysts. The stock gained 2.4% to finish at a record closing high of $138.07 and has nearly tripled in value this year, as demand for the company’s chips to support artificial intelligence (AI) has surged. Shares are just shy of their intraday high of $140.76 set in June. Several stocks with ties to the chipmaker, including partners Arm Holdings (ARM), TSMC (TSM), and Nvidia-backed Soundhound AI (SOUN), gained Monday. The moves helped boost the tech sector, leading the S&P 500 index to a record high. In a note to clients Sunday, Citi analysts said Nvidia is “still king” when it comes to its client base in the AI accelerator market. They said they expect chipmaker’s GPU sales to hyperscalers like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (MSFT) will double this year. Citi and all but one of the other 22 analysts covering Nvidia tracked by Visible Alpha held a “buy” or equivalent rating on the stock as of Monday, with a consensus price target of $152.41, implying about 10% upside from Monday’s closing price. Citi’s comments come after Goldman Sachs analysts said Friday they came away from an investor meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang “with a better appreciation of the company’s competitive moat,” citing the company’s large customer base, “robust and growing” software offerings, and ability to innovate. The analysts said orders for Nvidia’s Blackwell chip are booked out with lead times extending up to a year, and that Nvidia “expects supply to remain tight for the foreseeable future.” Goldman Sachs analysts also maintained a "buy" rating on the stock, and raised their price target to $150 from $135 previously. A week ago, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world's second largest company by market capitalization, behind only Apple (AAPL). With Monday's gains, Nvidia's market cap is at $3.386 trillion, compared with Apple's $3.516 trillion. Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft are the only three companies with a market cap above $3 trillion.

US stocks rose on Monday with two major indexes clinching record closes as Nvidia (NVDA) led a risk-on rally in the market that permeated through most sectors and even into cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up nearly 0.8% to close at a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 200 points, or almost 0.5%, to close above the 43,000 level for the first time. Tech stocks led the day's gains, with chip giant Nvidia rising nearly 3% to close at a new high above $138 per share. Other semiconductor stocks also surged including chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Arm Holdings (ARM), and Applied Materials (AMAT). And the rally broadened even to cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8% on the day. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old. The Dow and S&P 500 entered this week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Nvidia rose nearly 3% to close above $138 per share for the first time ever. This surpassed Nvidia's prior record close of $135.58 in June. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Investors believe much of that funding could be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. That news was followed up by a swath of bullishness from Wall Street analysts as investors anxiously await the latest quarterly reports from Big Tech companies in the coming weeks. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller offered a sense of wariness when talking about the Fed's path forward for interest rate cuts. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Waller said Monday that the central bank needs to proceed with "more caution" when cutting rates as he absorbs recent data showing a strong job market and hotter-than-expected inflation. "Data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired," Waller said in a speech at Stanford University in California. "While we do not want to overreact to this data or look through it, I view the totality of the data as saying monetary policy should proceed with more caution on the pace of rate cuts than was needed at the September meeting." Read more here. The Federal Reserve held interest rates at multi-decade highs for more than a year. Investors took notice, piling into money market accounts to grab yield that hadn't been available in more than a decade. But since the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, the flows into money market accounts haven't stopped. In fact, through Oct. 10, research provided to Yahoo Finance from Crane Data shows that money market fund assets have increased by about $180 billion since the Fed began cutting rates. This reveals a truth about the surge of "cash on the sidelines" some have argued could be a reason for the stock market rally to continue. For starters, it could be a nod to the uncertainty some feel about where things will head over the next year. On Friday, Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients that "history does not lend much support to expectations of a cash-to-equity rotation." Kostin's research, as seen in our Chart of the Day, shows that since 1984, over the first three, six, and 12 month periods after the Fed begins cutting, flows into money market funds are greater than into equity or bond funds. Kostin expressed a view we've written about in the past, noting that whether or not equities see inflows following rate cuts has more to do with why the Fed is cutting than the cuts themselves. "Money market funds have historically experienced inflows following rate cuts regardless of the economic backdrop," Kostin said. "On the other hand, equity funds typically recorded inflows if the US economy avoided a recession and outflows if the US economy entered a recession shortly after the start of the cutting cycle." Goldman Sachs upgraded its China growth forecast over the weekend, citing recent stimulus measures and new commentary from government officials that showed an openness to spend more aggressively to revive its economy. The bank raised its full-year China GDP forecast to 4.9% from 4.7% and also upped its 2025 growth prediction to 4.7% from 4.3%. Beijing has previously said it's aiming for an annual growth target of "around 5%." On Saturday, China's finance ministry hinted at another large stimulus package to support the country's ailing property sector and suggested more government borrowing, although the ministry stopped short of unveiling the exact size or scale of spending. Although vague, the comments left the door open for a more aggressive fiscal package, which investors are increasingly betting on as Beijing attempts to pull itself out of a long slump spurred by deflationary pressures from a sluggish property market and weak domestic demand. Optimism that the government will follow through boosted Chinese stocks on Monday with the Shanghai Composite (000888.SS), a key indicator of the overall performance of the Chinese stock market, rising more than 2%. Similarly, China’s benchmark CSI 300 (000300.SS) finished the day up just under 2% to recover from last week's lows. The index is up 25% over the past month on the heels of China unleashing its most aggressive monetary stimulus since the pandemic. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. The world's largest cryptocurrency has been surging in recent days and is now up about 8% over the past five trading sessions. Other cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8%, in the past 24 hours. The risk-on rally in crypto is helping crypto-related US equities catch a bid too. Shares of Coinbase (COIN) are the leader in the space today, rising more than 8%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its massive rally on Monday, jumping as much as 9% as investors bet on former President Donald Trump's improved odds of winning the November election. Over the weekend, both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory, with prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. Separately, DJT announced the web launch of its Truth+ TV streaming service on Monday. The app is currently available to access on Android devices and will soon be released as a native Apple iOS app. DJT shares traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of the company's highly publicized lockup period last month. The stock has also been under pressure as previous polling saw Harris edging slightly ahead of the former president. Trump's recent campaign momentum follows an appearance by Elon Musk at his rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. Meanwhile, Harris has recently embarked on a flurry of media appearances in which she was pressed on how she would fund some of her proposals surrounding the economy and immigration. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said Monday that it’s "likely" the central bank will make "modest" interest rate reductions in the "coming quarters." Monetary policy, he said while speaking in Argentina, remains "overall restrictive," though how restrictive is unclear to him. The job market remains strong, he added, noting that recent data showed that a rapid weakening in that market doesn’t appear to be "imminent." Thus, "It appears likely that further modest reductions in our policy rate will be appropriate in the coming quarters to achieve both sides of our mandate," Kashkari said. Read more here. Technology and Utility stocks rose on Monday, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) up 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) up 0.6%. Both major averages were on pace to close at a fresh record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose the most among the major averages, up 0.7%. SoFi Technologies (SOFI) stock jumped as much as 9% after the online lender announced a $2 billion agreement with Fortress Investment Group to expand its loan platform business. The segment refers pre-qualified borrowers to loan origination partners and connects lenders with borrowers. The move reflects SoFi's strategy of diversifying from its roots in student loan refinancing. "SoFi’s loan platform business is an important part of our strategy to serve the financial needs of more members and diversify toward less capital-intensive and more fee-based sources of revenue," said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi, in a statement. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, only six recommend buying the stock, while 10 have Hold ratings and three have Sell ratings. The stock is up nearly 20% from last year but far from its record intraday high near $27 upon its IPO in 2021. Analysts see shares falling to $8.91 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club. TSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand. TSMC last week revealed third quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected, according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Some 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Boeing (BA) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week. On Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. "Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term," CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. S&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal. Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58. The stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus to upcoming big bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3% to eye a new record high. On Friday, the broader index ended above 5,800 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.5% soon after the bell on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2% from its Friday record close. Earnings season continues in full swing this week, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) among those expected to report. Oil futures dropped more than 2% as OPEC cut its demand forecast for 2024 and 2025. Traders also reacted to a lack of detail from China's Finance Minister over the weekend on any large new stimulus spending. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 1% in premarket trading to $136.22, putting the chipmaking giant on track to surpass its previous record closing price of $135.58 posted in June. The AI chipmaker's shares have made substantial gains in October following a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, much of which will be funneled back to Nvidia. AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have cited furious demand for the company's latest Blackwell chips. Its stock is up 8% over the past week. Nvidia's gains put it on track to once again claim the rank of No. 1 most valuable company in the world in terms of market capitalization. It currently holds the No. 2 position behind Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.3 trillion Monday, while Apple's was $3.46 trillion. Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect it to report revenue of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of those covering the stock and tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Mag 7 Become Drag 7, Taking Down QQQ & Create Opening For “Q Killers”
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/14/mag-7-become-drag-7-taking-down-qqq--create-opening-for-q-killers/
Time Published: 2024-10-14T17:28:20Z
Full Content:
Lately, the Mag 7 Have Become the Drag 7 The Magnificent Seven, led by Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Tesla helped major indices soar to new heights over the past decade. Since early February 2016, the S&P 500 has appreciated 265% while the QQQs nearly doubled that performance at 450%. Chief among the QQQ’s rise has been the tech heavy members of the Magnificent Seven (aka Mag 7). Each of the Mag 7 generated peak returns, that were in some cases, well above the 450% QQQ average. Standouts such as Nvidia (+21,280%), Tesla (+4000% peak return) and mega cap heavyweights, Apple (787% peak return), Microsoft (972% peak return) and Amazon (727% peak return) helped drive the exceptional performance. While the Mag 7 reached record levels, investors cheered. Who would publicly criticize a fund or index that produced exceptional results irrespective of disproportionate weights in only a handful of stocks? But what happens when these same 7 overweight stocks start to falter? Nothing good. The same Newtonian principles that drove stock prices and indexes higher, apply the same magic in reverse. Whatever goes up can come down. Seemingly overnight, the Mag 7 have become the Drag 7. Much of the appreciation occurs due to Market Cap weighted passive indices that do not easily change the mix of stocks or assigned weights. Consequently, as money flows into various funds, the index constituents are purchased automatically. This pushes the prices and market capitalizations of the stocks, and corresponding indices, higher. This is true irrespective of perceived valuation or price. There is no check or intervention as prices rise. And as more money flows in, the pace of appreciation and momentum rise even faster due to greater weight that the constituents hold. Passive indices hold to their prescribed rules and buy or sell in a pro rata fashion as dollars flow in or out. Although there are some benefits of a passive index, principally competitive, low fees and trading costs, there is an inherent flaw. There is generally no valuation overlay. And just as a few heavily weighted stocks can push an index higher as the prices go higher, the same will happen as heavily weighted stocks fall. This is what is happening now. Heavily weighted Mag 7 stocks are falling, due to active investors selling the stocks, and dragging major passive indices down. The cracks in the impenetrable Mag 7 base begin to appear around July 8, 2024. Since, that time period most of the Mag 7 have fallen. Though market dynamics can change at any time, this should be a concern for many investors in the future. The history of the Mag 7 began many years ago. For a long time the market leaders were referred to as the “FAANGs”. This acronym corresponded with: Facebook (before it became “Meta”), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Notable among the missing constituents were Microsoft and Nvidia. This was before Nvidia was recognized as an AI leader. At the time, investors were bullish on Netflix as a Covid stock darling. After Covid, Netflix fell and the moniker “FAANGs” was replaced with the broader grouping of “Mag 7”. Microsoft and Nvidia were added and Netflix disappeared. The Mag 7 proved to be a more powerful mix than the FAANGS. Investors enjoyed a strong bull market rally, and with each year, as more money flowed to passive ETFs, a disproportionate percentage of the funds went back into the Mag 7. Their market capitalizations swelled. Several companies reached $1 trillion market capitalization (META) then quickly became $2 trillion companies (AMZN and GOOGL) and then even faster to $3 trillion market cap valuations (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA). Never before had massive companies reached $1 trillion levels, let alone $2 trillion and $3 trillion. Moreover, the moves beyond $1 trillion moved with unprecedented speed. Money flowed into index funds, which pushed stock prices higher, that continued to replenish a buying cycle that added more buying pressure, which in turn, increased the stock weights of the Mag 7. Today, only a handful of stocks represent a disproportionate percentage of the weight in indexes with 100 or even 1000 companies. This is dangerous for investors and it violates the basic underlying investment principle of diversification by not putting too many eggs in one basket. By way of example, only 3 stocks (AAPL, MSFT and NVDA) now comprise 35% of the Russell 1000 Growth index. This is far too heavy and can create major problems for investors when these three stocks drop. Moreover, more than 1/2 or approximately 54% of the Russell 1000 Index now resides in the Mag 7. Concentration can be a terrific thing when the Mag 7 are rising. For example, in 2023 the Russell 1000 Growth Index generated a return of 42.60% and the Mag 7 contributed 62% of the total performance. It was even more concentrated for the Invesco QQQ which generated a return of 54.85% with 68% of the performance originating from the Mag 7. However, the table below shows what can happen when the heavy concentration in the Mag 7 starts to falter. While the concentration is terrific when the stocks rise, it can be devastating when those stocks start to decline. This is the interesting characteristic that is happening to the Magnificent Seven lately. Some of the constituents are dropping and, more importantly, rather than creating wealth for investors, at least 5 of the 7 members, are starting to lose wealth. The table below illustrates. Magnificent 7 Performance Since July 8, 2024 to Oct 11, 2024 Since July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024, five of the Mag 7 have fallen and the Tech heavy QQQ index has been negative (-0.66%). The worst performer since July 8, is TSLA (-13.89%), followed by GOOGL (-13.53%), MSFT (-10.55%), AMZN (-5.25%) and AAPL. This has far reaching ramifications for asset allocation among portfolio managers who currently invest in large capitalization, growth-oriented baskets. Despite holding hundreds of stocks in their funds, the preponderance of the equity weights reside among only a handful of securities. Perhaps, equally important, due to the heavy concentrations of just a few securities in an index, pension consultants and other fiduciaries, whose job it is to advise clients, may find that they may soon experience legal exposure by not better diversifying their clients’ portfolios. The Table below shows the performance of the QQQ relative to another Index with a similar correlation to Technology stocks, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR). The ER30TR Index does not hold 4 (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA) of the Mag 7 and is underweight 2 others (GOOGL, NVDA). In this particular case, the returns for the period July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024 were a positive 6.7% for the ER30TR while negative 0.66% for the QQQ. (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). QQQ's Are Negative Since 07/08/2024 to Present (10/11/2024) The returns year to date (YTD) have shown similar results. While the QQQ have generated a solid 20.99% YTD, they fall below the 23.24% SPX (S&P 500) and pale next to the 41.63% for the Entrepreneur 30 (ER30TR). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Stock Indexes YTD (through Oct. 11, 2024) Moreover, in the context of longer periods, it is clear that the Invesco QQQ have prospered since January 2023. In the time period January 1, 2023 through October 11, 2024, the Invesco QQQ generated an impressive 87.25% return with exactly 2/3 of the return coming from the Mag 7. This is well above the SPX return of 55.22% and far above the 33.80% return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, the performance could have been much better. As the table illustrates below, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index provided a return of 122.22% during the same time period with a little over 1/3 of its total return coming from the Mag 7. Moreover, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index had only 21% of its weight coming from the Mag 7 whereas the Mag 7 represent approximately 46% of the Invesco QQQ. In other words, despite the strong performance of the Mag 7, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index provided 1.4X the return of the QQQ (122% vs 87%) with less than 1/2 the weight of the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ) and less than 1/2 the performance coming from the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Index Performances Since 12/31/2022 Is it fair to compare an index with 30 holdings with an index that has 100 holdings? If the holdings were equal weighted, then the answer would be “no”. However, in the case of the Entrepreneur 30TR (ER30TR), the weights in the Mag 7 were only 21% vs 46% for the Invesco QQQ. This means that despite having more constituents in the Invesco QQQ, the weights in the Mag 7 were much more concentrated. Moreover, 2/3 of the total returns in the QQQ were from the Mag 7, whereas only 1/3 of the returns for the ER30TR were from the Mag 7. This means that it is possible to have fewer stocks in an Index, yet have less concentration and greater returns. As a result, many investors are now beginning to seek alternatives to the concentrated nature of the QQQ and Russell 1000 Growth. Could the ER30TR be the new replacement?(Note: past performance is no guarantee or guide to future returns). Overall returns, led by the Mag 7, have generated extraordinary returns for Tech heavy indices over the past few years. But concentration to just a handful of securities becomes dangerous when the heavily-weighted holdings begin to drop. Several popular indices, such as the Russell 1000 Growth and Invesco QQQ have seen their assets under management (AUM) ascend to hundreds of billions of dollars during the past few years. The Russell 1000 Growth is now approaching $100 Billion and the Invesco QQQ are nearing $300 Billion. With each index holding approximately 1/2 its weight in the Mag 7, this implies that 2 indices, control nearly $200 Billion of the Mag 7. Many other funds and indices, as well as private funds, pension funds, SMAs (separately managed accounts) control similar weights. This concentration can be devastating to investors as the Mag 7 decline. Investors are now seeking alternatives and discovering that it may be possible to achieve higher returns with less concentration—at least for certain periods of time. The QQQ have had an extraordinary growth record in raising AUM. If the concentrated Mag 7 continue to falter, replacement indices may soon become prevalent. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please refer to the below disclosures: https://lnkd.in/e29X6rN

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Research and development (R&D) expenses are one of the highest quality markers of future revenue growth. Given NVIDIA's heightened revenue projections for the upcoming quarters, it is hardly a surprise that it is now absolutely dominating its peers, including AMD, when it comes to the R&D metric. $NVDA is widening the R&D gap with its closest competitor. Annualizing last quarter's R&D spend, NVDA is investing now almost at twice the level of $AMD. And the latter will have to split R&D between GPUs, CPUs and FPGAs, whereas NVDA can fully focus on building out the AI stack. pic.twitter.com/nL4BpTPNeU — Tech Fund (@techfund1) October 14, 2024 To wit, NVIDIA recorded $3.090 billion in R&D expenses for its July-ending quarter. Annualizing this figure yields $12.36 billion as the GPU manufacturer's cumulative (probable) R&D metric for the previous 1 quarter and the next 3 quarters. In contrast, AMD recorded $1.593 billion in R&D expenses for its June-ending quarter. Annualizing this figure yields $6.372 billion as the the company's cumulative (probable) R&D metric for the previous 1 quarter and the next 3 quarters. In other words, NVIDIA is now investing ~2x AMD's R&D expenses, based on the current annualized projections. This marks a significant deviation of pace from back in 2013, when both companies were investing almost identical amounts in their respective R&D activities. Since then, however, NVIDIA has continued to invest a higher amount into its R&D activities, and is now enjoying the fruits of those investments. What's more, AMD has to divide its R&D resources between its CPU, GPU, and FPGA segments. In contrast, NVIDIA is increasingly directing its resources towards building out AI racks, which only furthers the GPU manufacturer's lead in this highly competitive segment. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, William Blair now sees NVIDIA's FY 2025 revenue at a whopping $110 billion. To put this figure into context, the company's FY 2023 revenue was just $15 billion! Bear in mind that NVIDIA's GB200 CPU+GPU combo is currently priced between $60,000 and $70,000, while a single NVIDIA B100 AI accelerator costs between $30,000 and $35,000. What's more, the company's 72-chip AI rack is now priced at between $2 million and $3 million. $NVDA CEO: "We’re not trying to take any share from anybody. NVIDIA is a market maker, not a share taker. If you look at our company slides, not one day does this company talk about market share. All we’re talking about is how do we create the next thing? What’s the next problem… https://t.co/eya7xp7WSm — The Transcript (@TheTranscript_) October 13, 2024 In a recent interview with Altimeter Capital, NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang asserted that existing data centers will need around $1 trillion dollar worth of GPUs in the next 4 to 5 years to modernize and remain abreast with the evolving demand environment.

Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on track to notch a record high as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company. Shares rose over 3% morning trading Monday to $137.87. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. Nvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive, $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. Nvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by a barrage of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday. Nvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a mega-factory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Nvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday morning, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia’s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China, due to rising trade tensions with the US, had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June. Other recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term. “AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.” The chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown. Semiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs (graphics processing units). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.” Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Stock market today: S&P 500 heads for record high, Nasdaq jumps as Nvidia surges

US stocks rose on Monday to head for fresh record highs as Nvidia stock climbed and investors prepared for more big bank earnings to test that rally and the chances of an economic "soft landing." The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up 0.7% to head for a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped around 1% as Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose toward new highs, up about 3.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered above the flatline. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old. The Dow and S&P 500 closed a winning week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards On the corporate front, Boeing (BA) shares slipped almost 3% amid questions about the crisis-hit plane maker's future. The company, which faces a record $5 billion in third quarter losses, has slashed 17,000 jobs as a month-long strike hits manufacturing. The the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club. TSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second-quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand. TSMC last week revealed third-quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Some 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Boeing (BA) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week. On Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. "Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term," CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. S&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal. Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58. The stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus to upcoming big bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3% to eye a new record high. On Friday, the broader index ended above 5,800 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.5% soon after the bell on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2% from its Friday record close. Earnings season continues in full swing this week, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) among those expected to report. Oil futures dropped more than 2% as OPEC cut its demand forecast for 2024 and 2025. Traders also reacted to a lack of detail from China's Finance Minister over the weekend on any large new stimulus spending. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 1% in premarket trading to $136.22, putting the chipmaking giant on track to surpass its previous record closing price of $135.58 posted in June. The AI chipmaker's shares have made substantial gains in October following a massive, $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, much of which will be funneled back to Nvidia. AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have cited furious demand for the company's latest Blackwell chips. Its stock is up 8% over the past week. Nvidia's gains put it on track to once again claim the rank of No. 1 most valuable company in the world, in terms of market capitalization. It currently holds the No. 2 position, behind Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.3 trillion Monday, while Apple's was $3.46 trillion. Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect it to report revenue of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of those covering the stock and tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Sign in to access your portfolio

US stocks traded mixed on Monday but held near record highs as investors prepared for the next batch of big bank earnings to test that rally and the chances of an economic "soft landing." The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.2% after ending above 5,800 for the first time, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.1%. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old. The Dow and S&P 500 closed a winning week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing.

On the corporate front, Boeing (BA) shares slipped amid questions about the crisis-hit plane maker's future. The company, which faces a record $5 billion in third quarter losses, has slashed 17,000 jobs as a month-long strike hits manufacturing. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus on more bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies.

Title: NVIDIA CEO: Elon Musk Is “Superhuman,” Asserts Moore’s Law Has Ended And That The Modernization Of Existing Data Centers Will Require $1 Trillion Worth Of GPUs

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, not only struck all of the right chords in a recent interview but went a step further to highlight the mind-boggling scale of the market opportunity that NVIDIA has yet to capitalize on. While NVIDIA investors have been busy scrutinizing the choice tidbits from this expansive interview, the streamed interaction is also gaining traction for the flowery language that Huang used for the CEO of Tesla and xAI, Elon Musk. Jensen casually explains the killing of Investment Banking and Consulting Analyst programs. ☠️ $NVDA 👀 “EVERY SINGLE APPLICATION - Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Photoshop, Premier, AutoCAD - you give me your favorite application…I promise you it will be HIGHLY machine learned in… pic.twitter.com/yRnZhzQgBT — Compound248 💰 (@compound248) October 13, 2024 To wit, in a recent interview with Altimeter Capital, Jensen Huang asserted that NVIDIA's ongoing bullish case is nothing like the mania around Cisco at the apex of the dot-com bubble. Specifically, Huang believes that NVIDIA is "reinventing computing" and that the future will be "highly machine learned." “Moore’s Law has largely ended.” Jensen Huang on why Nvidia will replace ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of the $1 trillion CPU-based data center TAM with GPU. “We’ve reinvented computing, we’re not going back. “Imagine you have $50B of CapEx to spend: “Option A, Option B; build CapEx… https://t.co/NG9KgX5XCZ pic.twitter.com/xbXqG5uKYC — Compound248 💰 (@compound248) October 13, 2024 In another remarkable take that is rightly going viral, NVIDIA's CEO believes that the Moore's Law as we know it has ended, and, therefore, in order to extract the requisite computing power to keep pace with the compute-hungry software of the future, existing data centers will need around $1 trillion dollar worth of GPUs in the next 4 to 5 years to modernize and remain abreast with the evolving demand environment. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talking about xAI and Elon Musk pic.twitter.com/tPrwPzWozO — Evan (@StockMKTNewz) October 13, 2024 Of course, another clip that is going viral, particularly among Elon Musk's vast fan base, relates to Huang's flowery language when he describes how xAI was able to bring together NVIDIA's gear and operationalize it within its own data center in just 17 days, when typically it would take a lot longer. NVIDIA's CEO noted: "... Just building a massive factory, liquid-cooled, energized, permitted in the short time that was done...I mean that is, like, superhuman. Yeah, there's. And, as far as I know, there's only one person in the world who could do that. You know, I mean, Elon is singular in this understanding of engineering and construction and large systems, and marshaling resources ..." Meanwhile, as we noted in a dedicated post recently, NVIDIA's entire supply of its latest Blackwell GPUs is already sold out for the next 12 months as demand for those chips remains "insane." It is hardly a surprise, therefore, that NVIDIA shares currently remain just shy of their existing all-time high stock price of $140.76.

Title: Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks to Invest In?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corp-nvda-most-profitable-195916555.html
Time Published: 2024-10-13T19:59:16Z

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable NASDAQ stocks. Recent analysis indicates that an anticipated tech rally may be delayed until year-end, despite the S&P 500 achieving a remarkable 20% increase year-to-date. As September closed, the index rose by 1.6%, defying its historical volatility and showcasing market resilience. Positive macroeconomic indicators are emerging, with upward revisions to Q3 growth estimates and low jobless claims, suggesting a stable economic foundation. However, concerns about sustaining market momentum without new catalysts persist. Historically, stock prices and price-to-earnings multiples rise together unless disrupted by negative events. As the market approaches traditionally strong months following elections, expectations for a potential year-end rally are building. Despite elevated volatility and geopolitical tensions, investor caution remains. The NASDAQ 100 has surged significantly over the past two years, but this performance does not yet indicate speculative excess. In the last days of September, DataTrek Research co-founder, Nick Colas, joined CNBC to discuss the trading day and highlighted his outlook on the NASDAQ during the conversation. We covered his views in our article on the 10 Best Performing NASDAQ Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it: “...Over the past two years, the NASDAQ 100 has surged approximately 67%, marking a significant recovery since its lows in October two years ago. This performance is substantially above the historical average return of around 25%. Colas emphasized that while such returns are impressive, they do not yet indicate speculative excess; historically, a doubling of the NASDAQ over two years would signal potential trouble for investors. Looking back further, Colas noted that since peaking before the bear market in November 2021, the NASDAQ 100 has only risen about 20% over three years. This suggests that there may still be room for growth compared to prior bubbles when returns were much more pronounced within shorter time frames.” In a recent discussion on October 9, Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss the tech sector's mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Despite these challenges, Jason Snipe noted that the tech sector is having a positive day, attributing this to a combination of improved earnings estimates across various sectors and substantial investments in AI-related capital expenditures. He emphasized that ~40% of operating cash flow is being allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will start to yield returns. This focus on AI has contributed to some recent downgrades but also suggests continued upside potential for select names within the sector. Snipe further defended the tech space by highlighting the profit margins of mega-cap stocks, which average over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors. This discrepancy indicates a strong reason for ongoing capital inflows into tech and software companies that demonstrate earnings strength. He acknowledged that while there may be some consolidation and a slowdown in growth, he believes that investors' muscle memory will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks. When discussing NVIDIA's recent performance, Snipe pointed to comments made by the CEO regarding the endless demand for their Blackwell chip as a significant catalyst for the stock's movement. He expressed confidence that it would exceed earnings expectations when they report later in the earnings season. However, Snipe also addressed concerns regarding Amazon, which has seen its stock decline for 8 of the last 9 days. He noted that its retail business appears to be struggling, with retail making up 62% of its operations. Despite this, he highlighted AWS as a bright spot, which reported a 19% year-over-year acceleration. He suggested that competition from other retailers could pressure its retail margins but remained optimistic about the company's diverse revenue streams, including advertising and subscription services. Snipe's analysis underscores the complexities facing the tech sector amid market volatility and evolving economic conditions. While challenges persist, particularly with mega-cap stocks experiencing downgrades, there are also significant opportunities driven by innovation and strong profit margins that could support continued growth in this space. As expert sentiments shift regarding MAG7 and other big tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining their positive momentum in the market. Methodology We sifted through Finviz to compile an initial list of the top NASDAQ stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 20 companies with positive TTM net income and 5-year net income compound annual growth rates. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. TTM Net Income: $53 billion 5-Year Net Income CAGR: 80.81% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are applied in gaming, artificial intelligence, data centers, and professional visualization. It's known for its innovative technology and its role in driving advancements in fields like machine learning and deep learning. Impax Asset Management, a $50 billion asset manager, has increased its stake in NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) after underestimating the company's potential. The firm believes the company is currently undervalued, considering the growing demand for its chips driven by the AI boom. Impax also sees the focus on energy efficiency as a positive factor from a climate perspective. The company achieved significant growth in FQ2 2025, with revenue surging 122.40% from a year-ago period. The data center segment was the primary driver of this growth, with revenue increasing 54% due to strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers accounted for a significant portion of data center revenue, contributing to the company's impressive financial performance. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and increasing demand for AI-powered diagnostic solutions also played a role. Its technology is used by various companies, including NetApp, which recently unveiled a new AI-powered data solution in late September. Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, is also utilizing NVIDIA's H100 GPUs for its Colossal AI training system. Its focus on AI monetization and sustainability initiatives positions the company for long-term success. While the stock may seem expensive, its valuation is reasonable considering its growth prospects. Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the most profitable NASDAQ stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The new reality for big food stocks: Shrinkflation, upset shoppers, and excessive meat sticks

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The investor appetite for big food stocks is as thin as I was back in the mid-1980s. Note in that time period I was about five years old. "From a generalist investor standpoint, I would say it has been pretty quiet [around packaged food names]. Your typical kind of institutional money has been quieter in the space," youthful, energetic packaged food analyst at Bank of America Peter Galbo said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below). The way Galbo explained it to me, investors are in search of faster-growth stocks ahead of a prolonged stretch of Fed rate cuts. Think of the desire to devour Nvidia (NVDA) shares on any dip, as opposed to eating up General Mills (GIS) on a pullback. You can easily see that in some Yahoo Finance-sourced data. Nvidia's stock is up a sizzling 168% year to date. General Mills is only up 10%. PepsiCo (PEP) and Conagra Brands (CAG) are both up roughly 2%. Hormel (HRL) is down 4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up 21% this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) 13%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) 20%. But as I digested (pun intended) my in-depth chat with Galbo, I think there are a few other fundamental reasons that are keeping these companies out of investor shopping baskets (pun also intended). Your shopping list of explanations: The companies are still too big inside an investing world that's no longer rewarding the conglomerate model. Investors want focused strategies executing at the highest level. For instance, does Conagra Brands need to be selling frozen food and also hawking Slim Jim and Duke's meat snacks? Should Spam maker Hormel have purchased the Planters nut business from Kraft Heinz (KHC) a few years ago? The companies want to get even bigger despite investors not rewarding the play! Conagra Brands just purchased the Fatty meat snacks line. The company now has the meat snacks market cornered with Slim Jim, Duke's, and Fatty. Galbo tells me meat snacks are a growth category in snacking. Fair, but I question why one must own three meat snack brands! The companies are slow to slim down their slower-growth businesses. Only recently did General Mills sell off its North American yogurt business for $2 billion. Campbell Soup is hunting for a buyer for the Noosa yogurt business it got with its Rao's business. I didn't get the sense from Hormel's latest earnings call it's going to sell the Planters business amid signs the deal may not be working out as planned. Consumers are pissed off at Big Food for its pricing strategies and are voicing their views by purchasing less. You saw that in PepsiCo's volumes this week. The cumulative effects of four years of inflation continue to pressure so many households. Buying snacks is now a luxury. Traffic at convenience store stores has really trailed off the past year for economic reasons, but shopping has also shifted to club stores such as Costco (COST). Convenience store channels need to be doing well for a lot of food players to do well. The Ozempic threat on the long-term health of Big Food earnings power is rising every single day as new users of these drugs enter the market. Bonus reason: The stocks aren't valued for the realities listed above. They are still being seen as defensive value plays since the companies sell food. That's the wrong way to think about it, I believe — it's hard to defend Hormel trading at almost 19 times forward earnings, which isn't too far removed from the S&P 500's forward multiple around 21 times. An old rule of thumb in investing is that a 15 times forward P/E multiple is on the attractive side (I caution this is not always the case and each company is unique, so don't use my line as gospel). Then, there is raw commentary that I would argue is weighing on the sector's multiples. First up: These companies have become political punching bags this election season. Vice President Kamala Harris has vowed to tackle price gouging by Big Food if she wins the White House in November. Senator Elizabeth Warren has been making the rounds talking about shrinkflation and taking food companies to task for it. All of this rhetoric doesn't exactly embolden investors to go search for diamonds in the rough in the food space. There is also what we are hearing from consumer company executives, which suggests a strong rebound in sales and earnings isn't guaranteed in 2025. "We see that [the] consumer is very challenged, and that the consumer is making a lot of decisions. They're optimizing their full budget, so they might be cutting on food to pay for their subscriptions, or they might be cutting on food to go to see movies on the weekend. Really, there is a lot of trade-offs they're making when it comes to food." PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta told me this past week moments after earnings hit the wires. The company trimmed its full-year sales outlook. This aligns with what Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon told me last week at the retailer's Bentonville, Ark., HQ. "People at lower income levels are always more challenged. They have to make trade-off decisions, and that's been, I think, more acute since this inflationary cycle on the heels of the pandemic. So, a household income below $100,000 feels pressure in a way that they might not have a few years ago, and you can see that in their behavior. And we are trying to get prices down ... some of the more stubborn inflation has been in the prepared foods, dry grocery type, consumable categories, like paper goods, cleaning supplies," McMillon said. I wish Big Food well in regaining the hunger of investors. After all, these companies do feed the planet. It will be tough, however.

Title: What To Watch As Third-Quarter 2024 Earnings Season Begins

Earnings growth is expected to decelerate to a 4.4% year-over-year pace in the third quarter from ... [+] the double-digit pace of the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, earnings growth was expected to decelerate to a 4.4% year-over-year pace in the third quarter from the double-digit pace of the second quarter. Topline sales were forecasted to grow by 4.7% year-over-year in the third quarter. Forward earnings guidance will be crucial as consensus earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year 2025 were predicted to increase by 14.8% and 15%, respectively. S&P 500 Earnings Estimates Earnings season began last Friday with a handful of companies, dominated by financials, reporting earrings. 44 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report earnings this week, heavily emphasizing banks, but many industries are represented. Among the banks reporting are Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and PNC Financial (PNC). There are a smattering of other companies on the calendar, like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), CSX (CSX), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Progressive (PGR). S&P 500 Earnings Season JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) reported better-than-expected earnings last Friday, getting the bank earnings season off to a good start. According to FactSet, the blended earnings growth rate for the financial sector increased to 1.6% from -0.7% year-over-year due to the better earnings from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. The pace of loan growth for the banking industry has been slow, which should weigh on earnings growth. However, investment banking and wealth management revenues continue to benefit from strong markets, benefitting earnings at the money center banks relative to smaller banks. Bank Loan Growth The technology sector should report the most robust earnings growth at 15.5% year-over-year. NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA) should be the most significant contributor to the sector’s earnings. NVIDIA’s profits are expected to soar by 84% year-over-year on the strength of demand for artificial intelligence semiconductors. According to FactSet, the sector’s earnings growth would be 7.5% without the boost from NVIDIA. After some poor headline growth numbers for healthcare due primarily to acquisition-related write-offs, the sector should show some earnings life this quarter at 11.2% year-over-year growth. Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Moderna (MRNA) are expected to be the primary drivers of the profit increase, according to FactSet. The communications services sector rounds out the top three in forecasted year-over-year earnings growth at 10.5%. Not surprisingly, Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to be responsible for most of the growth. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector The energy sector earnings are forecasted to have the worst showing for the third quarter, with a 19.1% year-over-year decline. Natural gas and oil prices fell, resulting in an expected decline in revenues for the energy industry. Energy Commodities Two of Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKA, BRKB) top ten largest publicly traded stock holdings are Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Chevron (CVX). Berkshire has amassed an almost 28% stake in Occidental. A previous piece discussed why Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway favors Occidental Petroleum. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Sales growth is typically closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Estimated 5% nominal year-over-year economic growth supports the consensus estimate of a 4.7% year-over-year sales increase for the S&P 500 with some upside. GDP Growth Drives S&P 500 Sales Despite a more challenging start to the year, the pace of inflation growth has seen a general downtrend, which should help earnings this quarter. U.S. CPI Year-Over-Year The differential in price growth for producer’s input costs (PPI) versus the price increases hitting consumers (CPI) indicates that profit margins should be able to hold steady or increase this quarter. The topline sales growth, driven by economic activity in the quarter and supportive margins, allows positive year-over-year earnings growth expectations. Margins & Inflation The slightly weaker U.S. dollar could positively impact earnings growth from multinational companies this quarter. With approximately 40% of the sales of S&P 500 companies coming from international sources, the dollar can impact profits for companies selling products internationally. U.S. Dollar Softens Following the robust monthly jobs report, the markets repriced the pace of expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. Fed Fund futures now indicate a slightly less than 100% probability of a 25 basis point (0.25%) cut in November and December. The September retail sales reading on Thursday is the next significant indicator of the strength of the U.S. consumer and economy. Fed Rate Cuts Expected The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have continued to outperform the less sensitive defensives, implying that stocks are pricing in a higher probability that the U.S. avoids an economic recession. The relative performance of cyclicals versus defensives is nearing the trailing one-year high, reached in mid-July 2024. Cyclicals Versus Defensives The third quarter’s mid-single-digit year-over-year earnings gains provide a seemingly low hurdle for this earnings season. The profit growth should be achievable, assisted by topline sales boosted by solid economic growth. With the fear of recession fading reflected in stock prices and faster earnings growth expected for the fourth quarter and 2025, more attention will likely be paid to management’s future earnings guidance than the third quarter’s earnings beats. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), CSX (CSX), Wells Fargo (WFC), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), NVIDIA (NVDA), Chevron (CVX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: ETF Investors Shrug Off Market Uncertainties, Bullish on Mag 7, Schwab Survey Finds

Market volatility, high interest rates, inflation and the upcoming presidential election haven't affected the investment strategies of most exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors. Most ETF investors surveyed by Charles Schwab (SCHW) Asset Management said that these economic and political events did not change the way they invest in ETFs. In fact, roughly a third of the investors put more money into ETFs based on their reading of stock market volatility, high interest rates and persistent inflation, according to the survey results released this week. ETFs have a track record across market cycles, said David Botset, Managing Director, Head of Innovation and Stewardship at Schwab Asset Management, adding that "investors are confident in their investments even when the outlook is uncertain.” ETF investors have grown more bullish on certain types of stocks and sectors since last year: 69% are bullish on technology and 60% on growth stocks. Additionally, 55% of investors are optimistic about the the Magnificent 7, a group of seven mega-cap technology companies including Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). The Mag 7 stocks have a big influence on the stock markets and have driven much of the S&P 500's returns over the past year. But when they falter, as they did in July this year, they tend to drag the broader stock market down with them. The survey also showed how investment preferences vary across generations. For instance, 62% of millennials (or those born between 1981 and 1996), said they plan to invest in cryptocurrency ETFs over the next year versus 15% of Boomers (or those born between 1946 and 1964). A quarter of millennials said they plan to invest in alternatives ETFs, compared with just 11% of boomers. At the same time, 44% of millennials also want to increase their exposure to lower-risk fixed income ETFs. In contrast, fewer GenX (34%) and Boomer (26%) investors plan to do likewise. This is in line with other recent studies that point to recent stock market volatility making millennials more risk-averse compared to some older generations.

Title: How Interest Rates Will Impact This 7%+ Closed-End Fund

Small Cap write on sticky notes isolated on Office Desk. Stock market concept Normally when interest rates fall, we closed-end fund (CEF) investors are tempted to pick up a fund like the 7.3%-paying Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT). It seems like a particularly savvy move today, with this small cap–focused CEF trading at a 10.3% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Cheap! But is that really a good value, or could RVT get cheaper still? Let’s take a look, starting with small caps generally. Like large caps, they benefit as lower rates boost consumer spending. But there are two other factors that make falling-rate periods particularly advantageous for smaller firms: With that in mind—plus the fact that small caps tend to be more domestic-focused, helping shield them from global instability—you’d think investors would’ve bid them to the moon this year, right? Well, not so much. Small Caps Lag So far, traders aren’t calling for a small-cap rebound, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), in purple above, trailing the benchmark S&P 500 ETF (in orange). (IWM invests in all 2000 small caps that make up the primary US small-cap index, the Russell 2000.) We normally love a contrarian setup like this at my CEF Insider service, but this time I think the herd has a point. It’s true that lower rates encourage people to spend more. But remember too that rates tend to be cut during a recession. And in a recession, Americans are already cutting spending. So lower rates do tend to push up consumer spending in those times—albeit from an already-low base. However, when Americans are already spending a lot, as they are today, cutting rates won’t necessarily do much. Spending Ticks Higher As you can see above, the big jump in interest rates we’ve seen, from near nothing to 5.5% in just 18 months, didn’t slow consumer-spending growth. So it doesn’t make sense that consumer spending will grow with lower rates; that’s usually the case, but probably won’t be this time. What about the buying-on-margin story? That idea is a bit broken, too. Margin Loans, Interest Rates As you can see, the lower cost of borrowing on margin (related to the federal funds rate, in red above) made for a huge amount of margin borrowing (the blue line) during the pandemic. But margin balances went back to their normal trend in 2022, when rates rose. This, by the way, is the main reason why stocks tanked that year. In other words, the market has already gotten to a “normal” level of margin borrowing. Rates falling from 5% to 3%, where the Fed has said it wants them to settle, isn’t going to cause that speculative buying of small-cap stocks like we saw shortly after the pandemic—or for that matter, in the 2010s, when rates were also low. That also means this chart is unlikely to repeat itself. IWM Tracks SPY In the low-rate 2010s, small caps started from being oversold during the Great Recession. But even with the low starting point, they merely tracked the S&P 500. In other words, investing in small caps based on the idea that others will borrow to invest in them wasn’t a great move when rates were at 0.25%, let alone 3%. Which leads me to the final point: small caps’ investments in innovation. Technology has become a big part of the total US stock market because tech firms have provided tremendous innovation over the last decade: Companies from across the economy depend more on Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and the like more than ever. That trend has been running since the end of the dot-com bubble. The current scramble among big firms to integrate AI just exacerbates it. And that’s why the top constituents of IWM, the main small-cap index fund, are a worry. IWM Top Holdings There are good companies in here, like FTAI Aviation (FTAI), which repairs and maintains jet engines. But, as a few industry reports note (like this one and this one), the big aviation firms, like Boeing (BA) and Airbus, already use AI to improve their aircraft-maintenance services. So smaller firms like FTAI will need to invest in cutting-edge AI tech to compete. That’s squeezes smaller companies’ profits more than those of larger firms. But the main winners are those that provide the AI infrastructure both the FTAIs and Boeings need—companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) and NVIDIA (NVDA). This brings us back to RVT. While its yield sounds great, at 7.3%, it’s actually low for CEFs, which yield 8.2% on average. And while we love being contrarians at CEF Insider, in this case we can’t be, since RVT’s past performance shows that it should actually be cheaper. Let me explain. RVT Total Returns Price RVT’s market price (in purple above) has been beating IWM by a healthy margin over the last decade. But if we compare IWM to RVT’s total NAV return, which reflects the actual performance of the CEF’s managers, things look different. RVT Total Returns NAV RVT has actually been tracking the small-cap index for a long time, and if its discount falls to 15% or lower, that’d be a great entry point. But at a 10.3% discount, given its 10-year average discount of 11.1%, RVT is still not a great deal for us. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.
