Title: Nvidia Just Gave Intel a Vote of Confidence. Will That Keep Intel's Stock Rising?

Is a deal with AI darling Nvidia enough to win investors over to Intel's stock? A $5 billion investment and a promise to co-develop chips for data centers and PCs from the chip designer at the heart of the AI boom sent Intel (INTC) shares soaring 23% to around $31 Thursday. That brought the stock to levels not seen since July 2024, before a wider-than-expected loss and massive restructuring plan announced that August dealt a blow to investor confidence and sent its stock reeling. Roughly a year later, the struggling chipmaker has welcomed a new CEO, laid off workers, and struck a deal with President Donald Trump to sell the government a 10% stake. That inspired enough confidence to bring the stock up 24% this year heading into Thursday's session. Intel was for years a blue-chip stock and a member of the Dow industrials. It's fallen on hard times recently, with the stock at half its 2021 highs. Thursday's vote of confidence from Nvidia, which replaced it in the Dow, could be seen as a turning point not only for the stock but for a company that has struggled to engineer a turnaround. Today's Nvidia-fueled (NVDA) momentum has Intel's year-to-day gains above 50%. Some analysts now think the momentum could mark a turning point in sentiment for the stock, which Wall Street has largely viewed with caution and currently sits at around half of its 2021 highs. All 11 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha held "hold" ratings for Intel's stock up until Thursday. The Nvidia news is "a game changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game," Wedbush's Dan Ives told clients in a note Thursday. Wedbush said it expects the move, which could lend Intel some of Nvidia's AI-driven tailwinds, to help stem further losses of Intel's existing market share in server and PC products and boost the company's longer-term prospects. "The chip landscape remains [Nvidia's] world with everybody else paying rent," Ives said. Bernstein analysts led by Stacy Rasgon called the blessing from Nvidia "priceless." Some analysts said Intel may need further support. Moor Insights & Strategy CEO Patrick Moorhead called it a “step in the right direction” in an interview with CNBC Thursday, though he suggested Intel likely requires another $5 billion to $10 billion to build out its chip manufacturing capabilities. However, Moorhead said, there’s now a “pretty long line of people” the chipmaker could turn to in exchange for some concessions. "The question becomes control, ownership, and voting rights," he said.

Title: NVIDIA Announces £2 Billion Investment in the United Kingdom AI Startup Ecosystem

Time Published: 2025-09-18T19:00:00Z

September 18, 2025 15:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: LONDON, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced an investment of £2 billion in the U.K. market to catalyze the nation’s AI startup ecosystem and scale the next generation of globally transformative AI businesses. The new capital will be used to foster economic growth, develop more innovative AI technologies, create new companies and jobs, and empower the U.K. to compete in the AI market globally. Scaling AI companies in the U.K. has been challenging due to limited access to supercomputing, constrained venture capital outside London, rising energy costs and difficulty for VCs to access leading academic institutions, where many researchers are also entrepreneurs. NVIDIA, in collaboration with Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton Capital, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court, will accelerate the U.K. AI ecosystem by providing new capital for AI startups. “This is the age of AI — the big bang of a new industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “The United Kingdom is in a Goldilocks moment, where world-class universities, bold startups, leading researchers and cutting-edge supercomputing converge. There has never been a better time to invest in the U.K. — AI is unlocking new science and sparking entirely new industries. With new capital and advanced infrastructure, we are doubling down to empower the U.K. to lead the next wave of AI innovation.” The investment will expand access to capital in key U.K. economic centers, AI growth zones and deep technology ecosystems like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester. NVIDIA’s investment, combined with new, world-class AI infrastructure, will empower researchers and developers nationwide, fueling the launch and growth of AI startups. “NVIDIA’s investment is a major vote of confidence in the U.K. both today and long into the future,” said U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. “By backing our startups, empowering our researchers and connecting capital with talent, this partnership will create jobs, spark new industries and ensure the U.K. remains at the forefront of global AI leadership.” NVIDIA is committed to working closely with the U.K.’s leading company founders and VCs — especially in London, home to world-renowned academic AI labs — and partnering with top U.K.-based funds to ensure capital and compute reach the most ambitious entrepreneurs and most dynamic regions, including the U.K. government’s newly announced AI growth zone. Following NVIDIA’s recent commitment to manufacturing up to a half-trillion dollars’ worth of AI supercomputers in America, the investment will be domiciled in the United States and activated in the United Kingdom, celebrating the transatlantic partnership between the two countries. NVIDIA is purposefully investing in the U.K.’s future, unlocking opportunities for the next generation of British innovators. “In collaboration with NVIDIA, we're accelerating the growth of U.K. AI startups,” said Sonali De Rycker, partner at Accel. “World-class compute and fresh capital will empower the next wave of entrepreneurs and AI startups, create new jobs and further enable the U.K. to compete in the AI race. The U.K. has long been a hotbed for AI talent, with a strong community of researchers, founders and world-class universities, and this new investment will supercharge the AI flywheel.” “We’ve embarked on a new journey where scaling AI unlocks capabilities that, when we started in this industry over a decade ago, would have been considered magic,” said Nathan Benaich, general partner at Air Street Capital. “The U.K. has world-class talent and research, but the infrastructure has not kept pace. This commitment aims to bridge that gap by providing U.K. founders with the resources needed to build globally significant AI companies.” “We are in the midst of a seismic technology shift as people and companies around the world increasingly depend on more intelligent hardware and software,” said James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital. “The U.K. is fortunate to be home to some of the teams and companies leading that wave. The challenge facing us, however, is how to overcome constraints like the cost of energy or ability to access compute. Investment from firms like Balderton and companies like NVIDIA will help smooth the path, so more global winners can be built and thrive here in the U.K.” “The U.K. has the talent, research institutions and entrepreneurial drive to build world-leading AI companies — but turning breakthrough ideas into global impact requires collective action,” said Hussein Kanji, founder and partner at Hoxton Ventures. “We’re thrilled to partner with NVIDIA to commit resources to help Britain’s brightest founders commercialize their innovations and build the next generation of transformational AI companies.” “Britain has the science and the talent. This collaboration with NVIDIA puts capital and computing power in their hands to scale globally,” said Saul Klein, founder and executive chair of Phoenix Court. “With nearly 800 venture-backed U.K. companies generating revenues of over $25 million, the opportunity now is to back the next wave of truly differentiated AI companies solving real-world challenges.” About NVIDIANVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in AI and accelerated computing.

Tech stocks surged in recent trading, pushing the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq to record highs. Intel (INTC) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in the struggling chipmaker, and the two agreed to co-develop new data center and PC chips. Nvidia (NVDA) shares were up as well. Shares of PayPal (PYPL) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) also gained following an agreement that will have PayPal use Google’s artificial intelligence tools to boost internet commerce. CrowdStrike (CRWD) shares jumped after the cybersecurity firm gave a better-than-expected forecast for annual recurring revenue. Darden Restaurants (DRI) shares slumped as the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains missed profit estimates and warned higher costs could hurt future earnings. Shares of another restaurant operator, Cracker Barrel (CBRL), sank as the blowback from the restaurant chain’s location updates and logo change hit its results and guidance. A lower-than-anticipated outlook sent shares of Nucor (NUE) lower. The steelmaker said it sees weakness in all its segments. Oil futures rose and gold prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note advanced. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

Nvidia (NVDA), the world's largest public company by market cap, said it will invest $5 billion in Intel (INTC) and work with the chipmaker on developing custom data-center and PC products as artificial intelligence becomes more pervasive. AI crypto tokens rose on the news. The Santa Clara, California-based maker of the graphic processing units (GPUs) that underpin AI computing will buy shares of its neighbor at $23.28 each, 6.5% lower than Wednesday's closing price of $24.90, according to an announcement on Thursday. NEAR, the largest AI crypto token by market cap, climbed to over $2.95, its highest in a month, gaining more than 10% in 24 hours. TAO advanced 5.75% and FET 6.75%, outperforming the broader crypto market. The CoinDesk 20 Index added 3.41%. While Nvidia is known for its GPU production, Intel was a leader in developing microprocessors and entered public consciousness as the provider of central processing units (CPUs) that drove IBM-compatible microcomputers. Its fortunes have declined as AI, with its intensive computing requirements, has taken root. Intel stock surged 24% on Thursday, taking its market cap to $143 billion. That's just a fraction of the $500 billion it boasted in 2000, according to companiesmarketcap.com. Nvidia, with a value of $4.23 trillion, rose 1.85%. The U.S. government bought a 10% stake in Intel last month for $8.9 billion in an attempt to shore up the future of American chip manufacturing. The crypto industry watches Nvidia's performance with a keen eye as a proxy for market sentiment, which may reflect in AI tokens and the broader crypto market.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia said on Thursday that it would buy $5 billion worth of Intel’s common stock, becoming another major shareholder in the beleaguered company just weeks after the US government took a roughly 10% stake. The tech giant, which makes artificial intelligence chips, will pay $23.28 per share, it said in a joint press release. The purchase will give Nvidia around 4% or more of Intel after new shares are issued to complete the deal, Reuters reported. Intel shares (INTC) surged 22.77% on Thursday and posted their biggest single-day gain since 1987. Nvidia shares (NVDA), meanwhile, gained 3.49%. Last month, US President Donald Trump and Intel announced that the government was making an $8.9 billion investment in Intel’s common stock, with Trump calling it “a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future.” “This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL,” Trump wrote on Truth Social at the time. The investment is part of the Trump administration’s efforts to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States and cement America’s position as a leader in the global chipmaking industry. Trump has said that he plans to impose 100% tariffs on imported semiconductors, excluding suppliers that have committed to building products in the United States. Although Intel was once one of America’s most important tech companies, it has fallen behind rivals after failing to anticipate successive technology waves. Lip-Bu Tan, who took over as CEO in March, has been attempting to turn the company around. The two tech companies also announced that they would jointly develop custom data center and personal computing products. Analysts at Wedbush Securities said the overall agreement was “a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game.” “Today’s announcement further strengthens the US lead in the AI arms race against China as Intel now goes from a laggard to a catalyst,” they wrote in a note.

Stock futures are sharply higher after the Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut of the year; Intel (INTC) shares are soaring on news that AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) will invest $5 billion in the beleaguered chipmaker; Meta Platforms (META) revealed its AI-powered glasses; and StubHub (STUB) stock is pointing lower after shares in the ticket reseller fell in their first trading session. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are soaring as investors digest the Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to cut its benchmark rate and the economic projections of Fed officials. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up more than 1% this morning, while those linked to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were also solidly higher. The major indexes are on track to open at all-time highs, after turning in a mixed performance yesterday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was down slightly at 4.06%. Bitcoin is at $117,200, trading at its highest levels in a month, while gold futures fell slightly to $3,700 an ounce. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered the quarter percentage point interest rate cut that investors expected, but Chair Jerome Powell couldn’t guarantee that more were on the way. Fed officials on average expect two more rate cuts in the Fed's remaining two meetings of the year, but Powell said those projections were dependent on upcoming economic data releases. Meanwhile, the Fed’s economic outlook projected moderate growth, stable unemployment, and slowing inflation, with officials split on how aggressively to cut interest rates at upcoming meetings. Nvidia (NVDA) will invest $5 billion in embattled rival Intel (INTC) as the two tech firms agreed to jointly develop chips for personal computers and data centers. As part of the agreement, Intel will build custom processing units that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure, while it will also integrate Nvidia chips into its personal computers. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The move comes after the federal government took a 10% stake in Intel. Shares of Intel were up about 30% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia shares added 3%. Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday unveiled new AI-powered glasses as part of its developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which the company said “takes microphones, speakers, cameras, and a full-color display backed with compute and AI — and puts it all together in a single device that’s stylish and comfortable.” The device also comes with the Meta Neural Band wrist monitor that tracks movements to help control the glasses. The glasses will be priced at $799, the company said. Meta shares were little change in premarket trading. Ticket reseller StubHub (STUB) shares fell in their first session of trading yesterday after its initial public offering. StubHub priced shares at $23.50, and the stock climbed to above $26 during the session before closing at $22. StubHub sold 34 million shares and raised $800 million in the IPO. The money will go toward paying down debt, CEO Eric Baker said on CNBC. StubHub shares were down 2% ahead of the bell on Thursday.

U.S. stock market futures rose today following the Federal Reserve's rate cut, with all three major indexes climbing in early trading. The Fed lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, marking its first cut of the year, and signaled the possibility of two more cuts in 2025, boosting investor sentiment. The rate cut helped lift optimism in sectors poised to benefit from lower borrowing costs, especially tech stocks, which contributed to the Nasdaq's stronger futures gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 futures also rose significantly, expected to thrive in a lower interest rate environment.

September 18, 2025 — In a landmark move for the tech industry, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) announced a multi-year collaboration to co-develop AI infrastructure and personal computing products that blend their respective strengths in GPUs and CPUs. At the heart of this collaboration is NVIDIA NVLink, which will tightly connect NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing platforms with Intel’s x86 CPU ecosystem. The goal: to deliver cutting-edge solutions for data centers, enterprises, and consumers. Intel will design and manufacture NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs, which NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms. These processors will be optimized for hyperscale data centers and enterprise-grade AI workloads. On the consumer side, Intel plans to launch x86 system-on-chips (SoCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. These RTX SoCs are designed to power a wide range of PCs, offering world-class CPU-GPU integration to handle modern workloads from gaming to AI-powered productivity. As part of the collaboration, NVIDIA will invest $5 billion in Intel’s common stock at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. This deal remains subject to standard regulatory approvals. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s founder and CEO, highlighted the significance: AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture. This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing. Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s CEO, emphasized the shared vision: Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades — and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future. Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the NVIDIA team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business. This partnership signals a reshaping of the semiconductor industry landscape, as rivals-turned-partners align to meet surging AI demand. For developers, enterprises, and end-users, it promises more tightly integrated hardware that can handle the growing complexity of AI-driven applications. ©2025 C# Corner.
