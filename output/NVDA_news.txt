Title: Which Mag Seven Stocks Should You Own?

ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle

U.S. equities were mixed and little changed at midday as the market awaited more key corporate earnings reports this week, including from Nvidia (NVDA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell, while the Nasdaq gained. Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 when the beverage giant announced it was paying $18 billion to purchase Peet's Coffee parent JDE Peet's, and intends to split into two parts: coffee and soft drinks. Shares of furniture retailers RH (RH), Wayfair (W), and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) tumbled after President Donald Trump said he would soon be putting tariffs on furniture imports. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) shares dropped on a downgrade from Bank of America, which said that while the Sydney Sweeney ad campaign may boost the clothing retailer in the near term, tariffs would likely hurt results. Netflix (NFLX) shares advanced on indications the biggest streaming service's animated film "Kpop Demon Hunters," which was shown in movie theaters over the weekend, was a box-office hit. Shares of Seagate Technology Holdings (STX) rose on positive comments from Cantor Fitzgerald, which reiterated its "overweight" rating on the chipmaker. Intel (INTC) shares were up again after a 5.5% jump on Friday after the U.S. took about a 10% stake in the struggling semiconductor manufacturer. Oil futures were higher. Gold prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded lower. TradingView

Title: NVIDIA’s H20 China AI GPU Is Now Completely Banned In The Country, Says Report

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. AI GPU giant NVIDIA's H20 chips have been banned in China, suggests a report which quotes investment bank Jefferies. NVIDIA's H20 GPUs have been at the center of US trade tensions with China, after the Trump administration granted the firm licenses to sell them, multiple reports surfaced about Chinese discomfort with using the GPUs due to their US origin. However, one snippet of an investment note purportedly from Jefferies shared on social media claims that the H20 GPUs have been completely banned in China, which prevents Chinese firms from placing orders with NVIDIA. In a note purportedly belonging to Jefferies and shared on X, the investment bank outlines that Chinese authorities have completely banned NVIDIA H20 AI GPU sales in the country. The note follows several recent reports that have claimed that NVIDIA has asked some supply chain partners to halt H20 production. Jefferies also quotes these reports, as it outlines that media reports indicate that the H20 can no longer be sold in China. However, the bank also adds that "our industry checks indicate China has officially banned the procurement of H20 and other 'downgraded US AI chips' until further notice. As a result, Chinese entities are now forbidden from buying the NVIDIA GPUs, which appears to be a step up over earlier reports that have indicated that the Chinese government had simply required state-linked computing clusters to use at least 50% of domestic AI chips. As a result, Jefferies notes that "no Chinese companies will place orders with NVDA." The bank also adds that its channel checks in Taiwan have yielded the same results as media reports. "Our industry checks in Taiwan also indicate NVDA has suspended all packaging and server production work related to H20, also 'until further notice,' says the bank. As a result, Jefferies concludes that NVIDIA will be unable to generate any AI chip revenue from China, "likely until the US and China come to an agreement on trade." If the note bears fruit, then NVIDIA could see more headaches in the Asian country just as it is about to report its earnings. The shares are flat in premarket trading and enter the week after having lost 1.5% over the past five trading days. Since NVIDIA is in quiet period ahead of its earnings, it cannot comment on news, which creates an ample opportunity for short sellers to target the stock on any expected weakness. 1) According to Jefferey's note on the 24th, it suggests fimr's industry checks indicate that "China has OFFICIALLY BANNED the procurement of H20 AND other downgraded U.S. AI chips until further notice" It also said that its checks in Taiwan "indicate $NVDA has suspended all… pic.twitter.com/0OBtCdqE8Z Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$110,036.41 has retraced to roughly where it was before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks on Friday, which briefly sparked a rally in U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies. The reversal in BTC price has paused ether’s rally and triggered losses across the broader altcoin market. The CoinDesk 20 (CD 20) Index is down 3% on a 24-hour basis, while the broader CoinDesk 80 (CD 80) index has fallen 3.74% as of writing. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior analyst at FxPro, noted that liquidity appears to be shifting from bitcoin into altcoins. “Bitcoin is trading at $112,000, having fallen to a low of $110,000—its weakest level since early July. Friday’s surge attracted fresh sellers, pushing BTC below its 50-day moving average. So far, liquidity seems to be migrating from BTC to Ethereum and other altcoins like Solana. However, we cannot rule out that this is a precursor, with Bitcoin potentially starting a ‘sell-on-rise’ phase that may soon extend to altcoins,” Kuptsikevich said in an email. Adding to the narrative, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a prominent bitcoin whale, who received 100,000 BTC a long while ago, began diversifying into ether over the weekend. Singapore-based QCP Capital chimed in with a longer-term perspective, stating, “Near term, BTC appears to be ceding momentum to ETH, but our structural outlook on Bitcoin remains optimistic. Similar to July’s absorption of roughly 80,000 BTC of legacy supply, we expect institutions to continue buying dips selectively.” Highlighting institutional interest in dip buying, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet announced the acquisition of an additional 103 BTC, raising its holdings to 18,991 BTC. These developments come on the heels of Japan’s Finance Minister endorsing regulated crypto assets as a legitimate diversification tool within broader portfolios. On the derivatives front, the price swings since Friday have sparked notable activity. Hyperliquid, an on-chain perpetual futures platform, announced hitting a new 24-hour all-time high spot volume of $3.4 billion, driven largely by rises in BTC and ETH deposits. The exchange now ranks as the second largest venue for spot BTC trading across centralized and decentralized exchanges, with $1.5 billion in 24-hour BTC volume alone. This surge reflects the growing traction of specialized blockchain-based trading ecosystems.

Title: The Fed Just Shifted On Inflation: What It Means For Your Portfolio

ByRobert Daugherty, Contributor. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent equity markets higher last week with a subtle but important shift in tone. In his remarks, Powell signaled easier monetary conditions ahead and, more significantly, the Fed walked back its ill-fated 2020 policy “framework” that tolerated higher inflation. That experiment called “flexible average inflation targeting” was intended to balance past undershoots of the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Instead, it coincided with pandemic stimulus, supply chain shocks, and soaring demand, producing the worst bout of inflation since the 1970s. At its peak in June 2022, consumer prices were rising at 9.1%. Now the Fed is returning to its more traditional stance: flexible but committed to keeping inflation anchored around 2%. The pivot is not just technocratic fine print it reshapes the environment for investors deciding how to protect and grow wealth in a world of shifting policy, uncertain growth, and still-present inflation risks. And here lies the central paradox: while Fed decisions influence short-term interest rates and bond yields, history shows that equities ownership in real businesses have consistently been the most resilient asset class in inflationary and post-inflationary cycles. If you want to beat inflation, you need to own things that grow faster than inflation. That means stocks. Below are seven principles that explain why. Unlike bonds, which pay fixed coupons eroded by inflation, stocks represent claims on companies with pricing power, tangible assets, and the ability to adjust. Firms raise prices, increase productivity, and expand into new markets. Look no further than the S&P 500 chart versus New York Times front-page headlines: even amid tariff battles, political turmoil, and Fed chatter, stocks marched higher. The lesson is simple: money isn’t made on the front page, it’s made by owning real businesses that compound value behind the headlines. Reinvestment of dividends has historically accounted for the majority of equity market returns. In inflationary periods, strong companies tend to boost dividends to keep pace with rising earnings. The S&P’s 10 largest dividend payers today span sectors from financials to energy and illustrate the built-in inflation adjustment of equities. Bonds can’t raise coupons; stocks can raise dividends, often faster than inflation. Inflation reflects money losing value. Innovation reflects society creating new value. From railroads to semiconductors to artificial intelligence, the U.S. stock market has rewarded investors who align with companies driving productivity forward. The data is striking: Nvidia (NVDA) has delivered a 31,480% return in the last decade alone, while Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon continue to reinvent themselves. The biggest winners can come from anywhere. What is the common denominator of Monster Beverage, Deckers Outdoor, Tractor Supply? Innovation that beats inflation by creating entirely new categories of value. The academic evidence is overwhelming: over long periods, equities deliver positive real (inflation-adjusted) returns, while bonds often fail to keep up. Take the Fed’s last great inflation fight in the 1970s. Bonds delivered negative real returns, while equities, though volatile, ultimately rewarded long-term investors. More recently, the S&P 500’s equal-weight return since 1999 outpaced most of the decade’s “blue chips.” The lesson: bonds are ballast, but equities are the engine. Today’s investors aren’t confined to U.S. companies. They can own world-class businesses across developed and emerging markets. Multinationals often operate in dozens of countries, giving them natural hedges against inflation in any single economy. And crucially, leadership shifts. Some of the top 10 companies of 2000 were GE, Cisco, and Intel, but all have mostly lagged the index in the decades that followed. Only Microsoft and Walmart held up. Meanwhile, today’s top names such as Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia have emerged from outside the spotlight. Today’s leaders are unlikely to be tomorrow’s. That’s good news for investors willing to look beyond the obvious. Inflation penalizes savers, but it can accelerate revenue growth for companies with strong brands, cost discipline, or control of scarce resources. Consumer giants pass on higher prices. Energy producers benefit from commodity cycles. Healthcare innovators raise pricing power with each breakthrough. Even if nine out of ten “longshot” stock bets fail, the one winner can carry a portfolio. In a basket of 10 speculative names, nine could fall 90%, but one rallying 1,000% would still produce a positive return. Inflation hurts many but it rewards the scarce few who can adapt, and those are precisely the firms that dominate stock returns. The Fed’s pivot may change quarterly forecasts, but investors with a 10- or 20-year horizon operate on a different plane. Over any rolling 20-year period in U.S. history, equities have delivered positive real returns, regardless of inflation or monetary cycles. The catch? You need the stomach for volatility. The best-performing stocks of the last 25 years are Nvidia, Amazon, Apple which spent long stretches down 50% or more from prior highs. Nvidia itself has been in a 50% drawdown 43% of all trading days in the past 25 years. The courage to stay invested separates those who enjoy compounding from those who sell at the worst time. Powell’s reversal of the 2020 “average inflation targeting” experiment is a reminder that even central banks armed with PhDs and data sometimes adopt frameworks that don’t hold up in practice. For investors, the lesson is humility: don’t bet your future on monetary engineering. Instead, bet on the enduring ability of human ingenuity, enterprise, and markets to create value over time. Bonds can offer ballast, cash can provide optionality, and alternatives like real estate or commodities can hedge. But the core of any inflation-resistant portfolio remains equities. The Fed will continue to revise its frameworks. Investors should not. The principle is timeless: own businesses, stay invested, reinvest cash flows, and let compounding do the work. Inflation is an adversary, but stocks remain the proven defense.

Title: Reading The Tea Leaves: Implications Of Fed Chair Powell’s Speech

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Federal Reserve Chair Powell spoke on Friday at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole conference. His comments were widely anticipated since this conference is often the site of momentous policy shifts, and the US economic growth has slowed while inflation risks remain. Powell almost certainly saw last month’s soft employment report with its massive negative revisions as an economic warning. He noted in his comments that “downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.” Regarding inflation, Powell said that tariffs will likely result in a “one-time shift in the price level” despite some risk of a “more lasting inflation dynamic.” Notably, he referred back to the softening labor market when noting that inflation from “adverse wage-price dynamics” seems unlikely because the job market is “not particularly tight.” Notably, Powell spoke about the labor market before inflation in his speech, hinting at his shift in priorities. In judging the policy implications of his Jackson Hole speech, two additional phrases are key. He noted that “the baseline outlook and shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” and the Fed can “proceed carefully as we consider our changes to our policy stance.” Adding it all together, a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut at the Fed’s September 17 meeting is now the base case. The Fed fund futures market priced in an 81% chance of that 25 basis point cut at the September meeting following Powell’s remarks. The odds would likely be higher, but the August monthly jobs report is released on September 5 and could have an outsized impact on the rate cut probabilities. The S&P 500’s small gain for the week is deceiving, as the index closed lower in the first four days of the trading week before rising by 1.5% following Powell’s comments on Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), was lower for the week but rebounded by 2.5% on Friday. Notably, smaller companies, as represented by the Russell Midcap Russell 2000 Smallcap, are considered more domestically focused and economically sensitive and outperformed last week. Further, banks had a stellar week and are also economically sensitive, as they typically receive a boost from better economic outlooks. The betting markets lowered the odds of a US recession to 11% in 2025, and in their typical reaction, this year stocks rose. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. While there are several typically impactful economic releases this week, Fed Chair Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole should send the primary focus to next week’s monthly jobs report on September 5. It would likely take well above consensus job growth to change expectations from a September Fed rate cut, but it will be the crucial data to inform the committee’s decision. Monitoring Fedspeak this week will be important to listen for any walking back of most market participants’ dovish interpretation of Powell’s comments. As a leading candidate to be the next Fed Chair, Governor Waller’s comments on Thursday evening will be notable. Higher frequency labor market data should be monitored for further economic clues. Initial claims for unemployment benefits have been moving higher. Continuing claims for jobless benefits are at a multi-year high, indicating that people losing jobs are having a harder time regaining employment. Tariff headlines remain important market movers, as they impact economic expectations and have inflation implications for the Fed. In addition, there are fifteen companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings – most importantly, Nvidia (NVDA) will release its earnings on Wednesday after market close. With artificial intelligence (AI) spending key to technology sector earnings, Nvidia’s earnings and outlook are a critical market indicator. Barring a sizable upside surprise to job growth in the September 5 monthly jobs report, Chair Powell set the stage for a 25 basis point interest rate cut at the Fed’s meeting on September 17. Stocks reacted favorably as it raised the odds that the US might avoid the softening economy descending into recession. The current level of short-term interest rates is restrictive, and monetary policy works with long and variable lags, so the central bank must act before economic conditions deteriorate too much.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Rather suddenly, there’s been a vibe shift around artificial intelligence, the tech that’s hypnotized Wall Street and inspired cultish devotion across Silicon Valley over the past three years. And while it’s too soon to declare August 2025 the start of the AI winter, or the AI correction, or the AI bubble bursting, or whatever slowdown metaphor you prefer, it is undeniable that a series of industry stumbles is making investors, businesses and customers do a double-take. Among them: All of that has sent traders rushing to buy “disaster puts” — options that act as a kind of insurance for when the market drops — in case we’re about to relive the late-90s dot-com bust. Per Bloomberg, investors aren’t just preparing for a pullback, they’re bracing for a nosedive. “I suspect this will lead to a larger correction,” Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, told me, noting that Meta dangling NFL-like compensation packages to attract AI engineers was “a sign the spending was going over the top.” The tech stocks that have been propping up the entire market, including Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Palantir (PLTR), tumbled this week. (Of course, Wall Street is weighing a lot more than just some bad headlines for the tech sector. There’s also tariffs, mixed retail earnings, and, not least, the president of the United States’ campaign to install loyalists at the Federal Reserve. That central bank drama is piling even more attention after Friday’s speech by Fed Chair Jay Powell, who even in precedented times can move markets with a single furrow of his brow. You’ll be able to hear a pin drop across Wall Street as investors tune in at 10am ET.) For some investors, the tech pullback is “just a pause that may refresh as investors retrench and rethink how they want to position their tech dollars,” Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management Group, told my colleague John Towfighi this week. Maybe. But the ups and downs of the market are just one measure of AI’s impact, and even some of AI’s biggest critics say the downfall won’t happen overnight. “The bubble bursting was never going to be one event, but a series of sentiment shifts against technology that has never proven its worth outside of specious hype,” Ed Zitron, a tech writer and host of the podcast Better Offline, told me. “In any case, it’s been three years, and at some point there had to be some sort of proof that any of this was worth it… The narrative is spiraling out of control, with the only way to fix it being to show actual returns, which none of these companies have.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

After a sweeping rally for U.S. stocks Friday fueled by rising expectations of an interest rate cut next month, earnings from the world's most valuable company and a key measure of inflation could command the spotlight this week. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has been front-and-center in the AI boom, with surging sales on growing demand for the emerging tech. Investors will likely be watching for updates on its most advanced offerings, as well as its plans to navigate changing trade policies, when the company posts its quarterly results. Investors can also look forward to the latest release of the Federal Reserve's favored measure of inflation, which could influence whether the central bank makes its first interest rate cut of the year in September. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Nvidia’s second-quarter results due Wednesday could show whether the chipmaker continues to set the pace in the AI race, with analysts anticipating another sales record despite some headwinds from China export curbs. Nvidia said in May that it expects to report growing revenue, though it warned of a hit from China export restrictions to the tune of $8 billion. The company could offer more updates on its business in China after making a deal with the Trump administration to share revenue from its AI chip sales there. Nvidia is also considering offering a variety of new products for the Chinese market in advance of government approval. Some other companies set to report this week include chipmaker Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell (DELL), CrowdStrike (CRWD), cloud provider Snowflake (SNOW), and engineering software maker Autodesk (ADSK), along with several Canadian banks. A fresh update on inflation is set to come Friday, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index for July, after dovish remarks last week from Fed Chair Jerome Powell boosted expectations for a rate cut in September. The June PCE report showed that inflation ticked higher that month, but a similar inflation report released earlier showed price increases in July were lower than some feared. The PCE report is the Fed’s preferred measurement of inflation, giving its reading potentially more impact with central bankers ahead of September's interest rate decision. This week will also bring a pair of consumer surveys, data on the U.S. trade balance, and housing market data, among other things.

Title: What Wall Street Analysts Think of Nvidia's Stock Ahead of Earnings Wednesday

Nvidia (NVDA) is set to release its latest quarterly results after the market closes Wednesday, with analysts expecting the most valuable company in the world’s sales could reach another record high, despite an anticipated hit from export curbs. The AI chipmaker is projected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.02 for the second quarter on an over 50% year-over-year jump in revenue to $46.45 billion, according to consensus estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. CEO Jensen Huang could also provide more details during the company's earnings call about the timing of new products, including Nvidia's next-generation Rubin lineup and a more powerful AI chip tailored for China’s market. In May, Nvidia warned it could face an $8 billion hit from China export restrictions, and although the company recently struck a 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the Trump administration to resume sales of its H20 chip in China, Wednesday’s report will still reflect the full impact of the restrictions. Despite near-term trade policy headwinds, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the chipmaker’s prospects. Of the 14 analysts with current ratings surveyed by Visible Alpha, 13 call the stock a "buy," compared to one "hold" rating. Their targets range from $155 to $225, with the majority above $200, suggesting significant upside from Friday's close around $178. "Expectations have risen ahead of Nvidia's earnings, and we think rightfully so," Morgan Stanley analysts said last week, as they raised their target to $206 from $200, citing strong AI demand signals. UBS also raised its target, to $205 from $175, while Wedbush boosted its to $210 from $175. Shares of Nvidia climbed close to 2% Monday afternoon, and have added over a third of their value in 2025 so far. UPDATE—Aug. 25, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

Title: ‘It’s Not Going to Slow Down’: The Tech Stock Everyone Is Watching This Week

Wall Street is narrowing in on must-watch tech giant Nvidia (NVDA) this week, as the $4 trillion semiconductor company reports earnings amid an ongoing skid in the technology sector. “When the group goes down and the most important stock in the group reports earnings, that is going to have a bigger impact than usual,” Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, told Reuters. That impact has analysts rushing to change their projections for the release of Nvidia’s quarterly report on Wednesday, with multiple influential predictions now adjusted to show a higher price target of $194 per share for that 12-month period, the highest amount for which the shares have ever traded. The stock closed up more than 3% at the end of trading Friday at $177.99 amid a broader market rally led by other tech and finance companies. We covered the crypto companies that pushed that surge earlier today. “What youâre seeing is the recognition that growth at Nvidia is rock solid,” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told Bloomberg. “Analysts are raising projections because they simply need to, the stock is not going to slow down.” It’s been quite a year for Nvidia. The stock has been caught in the Trump administration’s tariff wars and fell sharply in April. It has since clawed back about three-quarters of those losses. But that dip followed a chilly beginning to 2025, as it became clear that even Nvidia would have tough competition from compatriot company DeepSeek, which rolled out a discount AI model that astonished the market. Recently, the stock wobbled this week as the broader AI market felt the effects of being dubbed a “bubble” by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. More immediately, Nvidia has signaled it is willing to play ball with Trump’s aggressive attempts to take stakes in major tech companies like Apple and AMD. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is in talks with the American government to produce a new computer chip, a move that coincides with a joint announcement that the U.S. will take a 10% ownership slice of Intel. âIâm offering a new product to China for … AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,â Huang said. But he added that âThatâs not our decision to make. Itâs up to, of course, the United States government. And weâre in dialogue with them, but itâs too soon to know.â In the wake of Altman’s comments, however, Nvidia’s share price fell to $174 from $182 in 48 hours, as proponents of the AI bubble theory came out in force. Still, no matter how much external pressure Nvidia feels from competitors and a rapidly evolving landscape of technology, it still remains the dominant player because of its sheer size and faster moves out of the starting blocks with its AI. It also has far more reach and potentially a wider variety of clients for its more diversified set of products. “[Nvidia] commentary on the demand side… should be more bullish just because their largest customers have all kind of upped their capex guidance over the last few quarters,” Roach told Reuters. In fact, it is so big and has grown at such a scorching pace that if its quarterly revenue is up less than 70% year over year when it reports Wednesday, the company would likely see its share price fall. A growth in revenue at that rate would be a major coup for most other companies, 24/7 Wall Street points outâfor Nvidia, however, it would alarm investors who are spooked by the idea that it may eventually even slow down.

August 22, 2025 11:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hot Chips -- NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA® Spectrum-XGS Ethernet, a scale-across technology for combining distributed data centers into unified, giga-scale AI super-factories. As AI demand surges, individual data centers are reaching the limits of power and capacity within a single facility. To expand, data centers must scale beyond any one building, which is limited by off-the-shelf Ethernet networking infrastructure with high latency and jitter and unpredictable performance. Spectrum-XGS Ethernet is a breakthrough addition to the NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ Ethernet platform that removes these boundaries by introducing scale-across infrastructure. It serves as a third pillar of AI computing beyond scale-up and scale-out, designed for extending the extreme performance and scale of Spectrum-X Ethernet to interconnect multiple, distributed data centers to form massive AI super-factories capable of giga-scale intelligence. “The AI industrial revolution is here, and giant-scale AI factories are the essential infrastructure,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With NVIDIA Spectrum-XGS Ethernet, we add scale-across to scale-up and scale-out capabilities to link data centers across cities, nations and continents into vast, giga-scale AI super-factories.” Spectrum-XGS Ethernet is fully integrated into the Spectrum-X platform, featuring algorithms that dynamically adapt the network to the distance between data center facilities. With advanced, auto-adjusted distance congestion control, precision latency management and end-to-end telemetry, Spectrum-XGS Ethernet nearly doubles the performance of the NVIDIA Collective Communications Library, accelerating multi-GPU and multi-node communication to deliver predictable performance across geographically distributed AI clusters. As a result, multiple data centers can operate as a single AI super-factory, fully optimized for long-distance connectivity. Hyperscale pioneers embracing the new infrastructure include CoreWeave, which will be among the first to connect its data centers with Spectrum-XGS Ethernet. “CoreWeave’s mission is to deliver the most powerful AI infrastructure to innovators everywhere,” said Peter Salanki, cofounder and chief technology officer of CoreWeave. “With NVIDIA Spectrum-XGS, we can connect our data centers into a single, unified supercomputer, giving our customers access to giga-scale AI that will accelerate breakthroughs across every industry.” The Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform provides 1.6x greater bandwidth density than off-the-shelf Ethernet for multi-tenant, hyperscale AI factories — including the world’s largest AI supercomputer. It comprises NVIDIA Spectrum-X switches and NVIDIA ConnectX®-8 SuperNICs, delivering seamless scalability, ultralow latency and breakthrough performance for enterprises building the future of AI. Today’s announcement follows a drumbeat of networking innovation announcements from NVIDIA, including NVIDIA Spectrum-X and NVIDIA Quantum-X silicon photonics networking switches, which enable AI factories to connect millions of GPUs across sites while reducing energy consumption and operational costs.
