Jensen Huang’s wealth could soon overtake famed investor Warren Buffett’s, after Nvidia's rising stock earlier this week made the AI chipmaker the most valuable company in history. Nvidia (NVDA) on Wednesday became the first company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion when its stock briefly climbed above $163.93. The shares added another 0.8% Thursday to close just above $164, a record, leaving them 21% higher for 2025 and up roughly 1,400% over the past 5 years. Huang, Nvidia's CEO, owns about 3.5% of the AI boom's poster child. He's seen his net worth climb to an estimated $142 billion as of Wednesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, rising $2.47 billion yesterday alone, and swelling over $27 billion since the start of the year. This week’s gains have made Huang the 10th richest person in the world in Bloomberg’s ranking, just behind Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) CEO and "Oracle of Omaha" Warren Buffett at an estimated $144 billion. At that level, it wouldn't take much for Huang's wealth to overtake Buffett's. Wall Street's analysts are largely bullish on Nvidia's potential for more gains, with a mean target near $175 compiled by Visible Alpha. A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the stock's gains and Huang's net worth.

Title: AMD's Latest AI Chips Are on Par With Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, HSBC Says

The performance of Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) latest AI chips is on par with those from Silicon Valley rival Nvidia's (NVDA), HSBC analysts said. In a note Thursday, HSBC analysts upgraded their rating on AMD to a “buy” from a “hold” and doubled their price target to $200, noting that AMD's latest series of chips can compete with Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs. AMD launched its Instinct MI350 Series GPUs last month, claiming the chips offered four times more computing power than its previous generation. “With the recent launch of the MI350 series, we were pleasantly surprised with the performance upgrades which imply that the MI350 series can compete with Nvidia latest-gen HGX B200 AI GPU,” HSBC analysts wrote. "Owing to the performance enhancements, the pricing premium is much higher than expected earlier which could help drive upside to earnings in 2025 and 2026." The analysts, led by Frank Lee, also wrote that there was further upside possible for AMD shares when the chipmaker launches its MI400 series next year, which could compete with Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin platform—scheduled for the second half of 2026. AMD unveiled the MI400 last month in an event hosted by CEO Lisa Su and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, which has signed on as a customer for the next-gen chips. AMD shares are rising more than 4% to $144 in early Thursday trading, having gained around a fifth of their value this year. Shares in Nvidia, which briefly became the world’s most valuable company with an over $4 trillion market cap Wednesday, are little changed.

US Stock Market Today saw the Dow rise while the Nasdaq dipped as investors balanced Nvidia’s $4 trillion milestone with new Trump tariff threats. Nvidia (NVDA) led recent tech gains, but President Trump’s warning of 50% tariffs on Brazil and threats to other countries stirred fresh concerns. Delta Airlines (DAL) jumped 12% after strong Q2 earnings. Meanwhile, jobless claims dropped to 227,000, keeping hopes alive for a possible Fed rate cut. As AI momentum grows and global trade faces uncertainty, Wall Street is watching both Nvidia’s rise and Trump’s aggressive trade push very closely.

Title: The S&P is soaring, but fewer companies are setting record highs. Why that could be a red flag for the market
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/10/stocks-soaring-record-highs-market-breadth-red-flag/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T14:03:44Z
Full Content:
Alicia Adamczyk is a New York City-based senior writer at Fortune, covering personal finance, investing, and retirement. The S&P 500 has been setting record highs in recent days, a dramatic turn from the market selloff back in April. But analysts are warning fortunes could change if overall market participation in the rally holds at the current rate. The new heights the S&P is reaching are being undermined by narrow company participation in those highs, according to a July 5 report from Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at wealth and investment management firm Oppenheimer & Co., and first reported by Bloomberg. Referred to as market breadth, analysts often try to see how many companies in a specific index or sector are participating in a rally to gauge how healthy it really is. That is important to track, says Wald, because narrow participation can mask underlying weakness in the market: Since 1972, the S&P 500 has posted below-average returns over the next one-, three-, six-, and 12-month periods when its all-time high coincides with fewer than 100 companies on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) also hitting new highs, the analysis finds. At the last market high, 88 companies on the NYSE also hit a high. Indeed, big tech companies have been the drivers behind the recent market heights: Just five stocks—Amazon (AMZN), Broadcom (AVGO), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA)—are contributing over half of the S&P 500’s total return, according to an analysis from Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial. It’s always a concern when just a few companies are responsible for most of the gains—because that means those gains could easily turn into losses depending on the strength of just a handful of companies. That’s what happened in mid-2023, when a Magnificent Seven–driven rally faded. And while the S&P 500 was less than 1% away from a new high at Wednesday’s close, the median S&P 500 stock was trading about 12% below a 52-week high, Turnquist finds. “Breadth is a little underwhelming,” he writes. “For context, over the last decade, the gap between the index and the median stock’s 52-week highs has averaged around 5%.” The good news, according to analysts, is that market breadth has been improving in recent weeks. The share of stocks in the S&P 500 above their 200-day moving average is 61%, just below the 10-year average of 62%, says Chris Haverland, global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute (WFII). Another positive sign for the market: All S&P 500 sectors have participated in the rally. Haverland says he expects to see more improvement in broader participation as investors get greater clarity on fiscal and trade policies. “Given the strong rally, however, we wouldn’t be surprised to see some consolidation in the coming months as the economy and earnings begin to digest the evolving trade policy,” Haverland says. “So, it may be a good time to rebalance portfolios.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Watch These Nvidia Stock Price Levels as AI Chip Giant Hits $4 Trillion Market Value

Nvidia (NVDA) shares hit a record high Wednesday as the AI investor favorite became the first company ever to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion. Nvidia shares have risen 88% from their early-April low and are up 20% since the start of the year, boosted by expectations that major technology companies will continue snapping up the chip giant's products as they build out their AI capabilities. Nvidia shares closed Wednesday's session nearly 2% higher at around $163, leaving the market value just shy of the milestone level it briefly surpassed early in the day. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s weekly chart and identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. Since forming a bullish engulfing pattern in early April, Nvidia shares have trended sharply higher, with the price climbing back above the 50-week moving average (MA) in May on its way toward its recent highs. Moreover, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum, but remains below overbought levels, indicating the shares have more room to test higher prices before consolidating. However, it’s worth pointing out that trading volume has steadily declined during the stock’s move higher in recent months, suggesting that larger market participants may remain on the sidelines. Let’s apply technical analysis to Nvidia’s chart to forecast how a longer-term uptrend in the stock may play out and also identify key support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can forecast where Nvidia shares may be headed next by applying bars pattern analysis, a tool that analyzes prior trends to project how a future directional move may take shape. When applying the analysis to Nvidia’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the strong trending period from January to August 2023 and overlay them from the stock’s recent close above the 50-week MA. This projects an upside target of around $300 and indicates the move higher could last until late December this year if a similar trend emerges. We selected this prior trend as it also followed a bullish close above the 50-week SMA and has closely replicated the stock's current price action in recent weeks. During pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth watching the $130 level. The shares could find support in this area near the upward sloping 50-week MA and a trendline that connects a series of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to June last year. Finally, the bulls’ failure to successfully defend this level could see Nvidia shares fall to lower support around $97. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this region near the prominent March 2024 swing high, which sit just above major lows that formed on the chart in August latter that year and April this year.

Major U.S. equities indexes rose Wednesday as AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) became the first company in the world to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization and President Trump released letters to more trading partners outlining tariff rates set to take effect on Aug. 1. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6%, closing just shy of a new record. The Dow ended the midweek session up 0.5%, while outperformance from the tech sector helped the Nasdaq climbed 0.9% to a record closing high. Shares of AES Corp. (AES) skyrocketed 19.8%, leading gains on the S&P 500 following reports that the power generator is exploring a sale. Several major infrastructure investors including BlackRock's (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit have been evaluating an acquisition of AES amid declines in its share price over the past few years, Bloomberg reported. AES generates energy from a variety of sources, including hydro, wind, and solar, and has signed agreements with multiple tech firms to provide renewable energy for data centers. Reports of a potential takeover bid also helped lift shares of engineering design software firm PTC Inc. (PTC), which surged 17.7%. Bloomberg indicated that rival Autodesk (ADSK), which competes with PTC in the computer-aided design and product lifecycle management markets, is evaluating a potential acquisition. Autodesk shares slipped 2.4%. Major cryptocurrencies moved higher, with the price of Bitcoin hitting a record high around $112,000 amid optimism about a crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the U.S. under the Trump administration. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., advanced 5.4%, adding to a string of recent gains leaving the stock up over 50% since the start of the year. Newly released minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that policymakers believe tariff-related inflationary pressure will be moderate and still anticipate interest-rate cuts in 2025. The projection for potential Fed rate cuts and the likelihood of lower mortgage rates helped lift housing-related stocks. D.R. Horton (DHI) shares gained 5.4% Shares of fellow home builders Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM), as well as shares of residential construction supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR), all added around 4.5%. Boeing (BA) shares climbed 3.7%, a day after the company reported it delivered 150 commercial jets in the second quarter, up from 92 in the year-ago period and ahead of analysts' forecasts. The aviation giant also topped expectations for quarterly deliveries of helicopters and jets in its defense segment. Shares of data analytics firm Fair Isaac (FICO) logged the weakest performance in the S&P 500 for the second straight session, dropping 6.5% Wednesday. The two-day slide came after Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, indicated that lenders will be able to evaluate the creditworthiness of mortgage borrowers using the VantageScore system, a competitor to Fair Isaac's FICO credit scores. Hershey (HSY) shares fell 4.7% after the chocolate maker named a new CEO. The confectionery company announced that Kirk Tanner, who currently serves as the top executive for fast-food giant Wendy's (WEN), will take the helm at Hershey starting next month.

Title: How Much Is $4 Trillion? Here Are Some Ways To Think About Nvidia's Market Cap Milestone

Nvidia (NVDA) briefly surpassed a record market capitalization of $4 trillion on Wednesday morning, an amount of money that could buy you pretty much anything. The tech titan's market value is comparable to some of the largest economies in the world, as a $4 trillion gross domestic product is roughly what was produced in 2024 by Japan and India, per the World Bank, trailing only the U.S., China, and Germany. Here's a rundown of some measures of what the artificial intelligence chipmaking giant is now worth. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has become the richest person in the world thanks to his stake in Tesla, where he was an early investor, along with other companies he has helped start or acquire, like SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and X. As part of that wealth exists in the form of shares in Tesla, the billionaire's net worth can vary on a daily basis as the electric vehicle company's stock price moves. The Forbes billionaires list on Wednesday puts Musk's net worth just shy of $400 billion, still at least $100 billion more than Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, or Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, but only about 10% of Nvidia's current value. Based on the current market caps of the just over 500 stocks that make up the landmark index (to account for companies like Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) with multiple share classes, Nvidia's current value could buy nearly half of the index. Starting from the least valuable with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at about $5.5 billion and working up, Nvidia's $4 trillion market cap is worth as much as the bottom 216 companies in the S&P 500, according to Investopedia's calculations. That group includes such household names as General Mills (GIS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), and Best Buy (BBY). In its annual ranking of the most valuable sports franchises in the world, Forbes last December estimated that the top 50 teams globally across the NFL, MLB, NBA, and professional soccer were worth a combined $289 billion. That means that at Nvidia's current market cap, it could acquire the 50 most valuable and popular sports teams including the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, and Real Madrid nearly 14 times. In its most recent valuation after the 2023 season, Forbes pegged the value of all 10 teams on the current Formula One racing grid at about $19 billion, meaning Nvidia could afford to buy the racing series more than 200 times. In March 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's then-recently announced Blackwell chip, designed for the heavy workloads of running and training AI models, would cost between $30,000 and $40,000 each, estimating that about $10 billion of R&D costs went into the chip. That means Nvidia's market cap could buy between 100 million and 133 million of its own chips. For comparison, Elon Musk's xAI startup, which makes the Grok chatbot that is used on the social media site X, has installed about 200,000 chips from Nvidia to train and run the product.

Microsoft won't be the first company to see its market cap touch $4 trillion—but its shares still have plenty of room to rise, one analyst said. Oppenheimer cited growth in Microsoft's (MSFT) AI revenue among its reasons on Wednesday to upgrade the software giant's shares to a bullish "outperform" rating. It set a $600 price target that is well above Visible Alpha's average of just over $548 and one of a few that is $5 below the highest one out there. The target represents about a 20% premium to Tuesday's close; the shares were recently up nearly 1% to nearly $501, perhaps on track for their first close above $500 apiece. (You can read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) The company's market cap is around $3.7 trillion today, according to Visible Alpha data. Growing AI revenue offers "not only valuation support ... but also upside potential as this revenue stream continues scaling fast and investors embrace Microsoft as one of the long-term AI winners in software," Oppenheimer wrote. The analysts also said Microsoft was one of "only a few vendors in the software industry" capable of a so-called "Rule of 60" profile, a reference to the concept of a company having a combined annual revenue growth rate and EBITDA margin above 60. That, they said, "lends good support to premium multiples" for Microsoft's stock. Microsoft is one of only three companies with a market cap above $3 trillion. Nvidia (NVDA) this morning became the first to top $4 trillion; Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note earlier today said he figures Microsoft will get there "this summer." Apple (AAPL) has a market cap of about $3.1 trillion.

U.S. equities were higher but little changed at midday as the market continued to focus on what effect new Trump administration tariffs will have on the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were up.

Nvidia becomes world’s first $4 trillion company, marking a historic milestone in the AI-driven tech race. Surging 2.5% in stock value, Nvidia outpaced Apple and Microsoft to claim the top global spot. Fueled by skyrocketing demand for AI chips powering platforms like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, the chipmaker reported $44.1 billion in revenue last quarter. Despite export restrictions and challenges from Chinese rivals, Nvidia has rallied 74% since April. CEO Jensen Huang sees global AI expansion just beginning. With future projections hitting $6 trillion, Nvidia remains at the center of the AI revolution, reshaping the world’s industries, infrastructure, and innovation.

Title: Nvidia Rides the AI Wave to Become the World’s First $4 Trillion Company

When the stock markets opened this morning, Nvidia (NVDA) became the world’s first publicly traded company to reach a market value of $4 trillion, surpassing tech industry giants Apple and Microsoft in reaching the record-setting benchmark. While Nvidia’s market cap has since dipped to $3.99 trillion as of writing, it is nonetheless an incredible achievement to be the first company to cross the $4 trillion mark. Nvidia’s extraordinary financial success is due in significant part to the company’s commitment to making chips for the AI arms race, a move that helped it reach a $2 trillion valuation — the highest-ever at the time for a chipmaker — not even a year and a half ago. In the past five years, Nvidia’s stock price has gone from less than $11 per share to over $163 today. Save for a sizable tumble in April this year, which the company has obviously since recovered from, it has been nearly exclusively good news for the American multinational corporation during the AI era. Nvidia’s revenue eclipsed $130.5 billion in fiscal year 2025, a 114% increase year-over-year, and way above the company’s $26.97 billion revenue in 2023. Nvidia’s rise has been meteoric. Meanwhile, Microsoft, which boasts an impressive $3.75 trillion market cap, has experienced tremendous growth of its own over the past five years. Microsoft’s stock price has risen 290 points, or 136%, in five years. In contrast to many of its peers, Microsoft has also had an excellent 2025 so far, with stock prices rising 20.5% since January 1. However, Microsoft recently laid off about 15,000 employees as part of its AI-focused restructuring in the past two months, so while investors may be loving Microsoft, all is not well at the Redmond-based company. Another company that was a strong contender to hit the $4 trillion market cap mark first, Apple, has experienced a very different 2025 than Nvidia and Microsoft. Apple’s stock price has dropped 35 points (14.3%) so far this year and is about 50 points off its peak from last December. On December 27, 2024, Apple came close to $4 trillion — hitting $3.86 trillion. From hitting $1 trillion market cap in May 2023 to topping $4 trillion, if only briefly, on July 9, 2025, Nvidia has benefited from the AI hype more than any other company on Earth. “This is a historical moment for Nvidia, the tech space flexing its muscles, and speaks to the AI Revolution hitting its next stage of growth led by the one chip fueling AI… Nvidia,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told CNN over email today. Ives also told CNN that he expects Microsoft will reach the $4 trillion mark sometime this summer. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, believes the company is still in the early stages of AI’s financial and technological potential. He said on an earnings call in May that every country and industry on Earth will need AI. Huang may be right, as the financial markets love AI, even if society at large doesn’t.

U.S. stock futures are ticking higher as investors continue to monitor the White House for updates on tariff policies; Nvidia (NVDA) stock approaches a $4 trillion market capitalization; Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion; U.S.-listed shares of Verona Pharma (VRNA) are jumping in premarket trading after Merck (MRK) agreed to purchase the company for $10 billion; and AES (AES) shares are soaring on a report that the renewable energy provider is exploring a potential sale. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher as investors watch for more tariffs developments. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.2% after the blue-chip index shed 0.4% in the prior session. S&P 500 futures are edging higher after the benchmark index declined slightly yesterday, while Nasdaq futures are up slightly after the tech-heavy index inched higher Tuesday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is ticking higher to trade at around $109,000. The 10-year Treasury note yield is little changed. Oil futures are slightly higher. Gold futures are declining. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus as the AI chipmaker comes close to becoming the most valuable company in history. Nvidia stock rose just over 1% Tuesday to close at an all-time high of exactly $160, pushing its market capitalization to $3.90 trillion. That's just below Apple's (AAPL) closing record of $3.91 trillion last December. Nvidia could reach a market cap of $4 trillion if its share price moves to $163.93. Nvidia shares are edging higher in premarket trading. Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion. CNBC said that "almost 30 domestic and foreign private equity firms in China have submitted non-binding offers," adding that Starbucks may retain a 30% stake. According to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter, most prospective investors in Starbucks' Chinese business "are eyeing a controlling stake in the operation." Starbucks shares are nearly 2% higher in premarket trading. U.S.-listed shares of London-based Verona Pharma (VRNA) are surging 20% in premarket trading after the firm agreed to be acquired by U.S. drug giant Merck (MRK) for $107 per American depositary share, or about $10 billion. The acquisition will add chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment Ohtuvayre, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in June 2024, to Merck's drug portfolio. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. AES (AES) shares are soaring nearly 15% in premarket trading on a Bloomberg report that the renewable energy provider "is exploring options including a potential sale amid takeover interest." AES has signed deals several tech firms, including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), to provide renewable power for data centers. Infrastructure investors including BlackRock's (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit and Brookfield Asset Management "have been studying AES after the company's shares lost about half their value over the past two years," the report said.
