Title: Affordability, AI Stocks, Parlays and Bad Bunny Top Investopedia’s Terms of the Year

Some weeks last a year, and some years feel like they last a decade. 2025 has brought us ten years' worth of news that has reshaped the global economy and financial markets at a breakneck pace. A tariff war, the AI of everything and the stocks tied to it, the proliferation of sports betting and the prediction markets, the entrance of cryptocurrencies into our federal banking system, and a relentless bull market were just some of this year’s headlines. Investopedia’s ever-curious readers stayed on top of all of these market-moving events as they circulated through our articles and financial terms that helped define these dynamics. Some events drew more interest and attention from our readers than others, demonstrating what was truly on the minds of educated investors in 2025. Here are Investopedia’s top terms of this year: Investopedia Investopedia No other word has captured the attention of our readers and most consumers this year. Inflation, although lower than the 2022 highs, remained persistent throughout the year and was amplified by the White House's aggressive tariff policies. Food prices, health care, and home prices remained persistently high, pushing consumer sentiment to lows not seen since the Great Financial Crisis. More Americans felt priced out of the so-called “American Dream," with the lack of home affordability among their top concerns. While some political leaders called the use of the word ‘affordability’ a ‘hoax’, many Americans who feel trapped in the bottom leg of the K-shaped economy felt its real effects in mounting debt and lack of savings. Tariffs dominated the headlines in 2025 and for the better part of 2024, making it our top term last year. Still, 2025 was shaped more by the impacts, or concerns about the impacts of tariffs on issues such as affordability (see above). That said, investors, consumers, and business owners needed a calculator and a good eraser to try to quantify the impact of tariffs on the real cost of goods, given how many times they were imposed, reduced, or reciprocated by the White House in 2025. There is no doubt that tariffs have become one of the key instruments of economic policy in the 2020s, and we should expect this term to remain popular. Among all the major asset classes in 2025, none shone brighter than gold. The precious metal surged more than 60% year-to-date, as investors, from global central banks to retail investors shopping at Costco on a Sunday, clung to it as the safe-haven asset it is known to be. Even as the stock market and Bitcoin steadily rose throughout most of the year, gold’s allure was too strong for those investors looking for a buoy to cling to in the tumultuous seas of tariffs and stock market uncertainty. Record gold prices spilled over into other metals, such as silver, which also hit record-high prices throughout the year. 2025 may be remembered as the beginning of the super-scaling of the Artificial Intelligence ecosystem and infrastructure, and the stocks that took off with it. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA), have been benefitting from the build-out of AI for several years, 2025 was the year we saw companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Alphabet (GOOGL) blow out their CapEx budgets to the tune of $380 billion, and pledging to spend even more over the next several years. The more they spent, the more their stock prices climbed, until, that is, the last quarter of 2025, when investors and executives began questioning whether these AI stocks are in a bubble. According to Investopedia's most recent sentiment survey, our readers agree. The Trump administration came into office pledging to make America the ‘Crypto Capital of the World’. It began that process by passing the Stablecoin Act of 2025, also known as the Genius Act. That established the first federal framework for payment Stablecoins in the U.S. Our readers wanted to understand what a Stablecoin actually is, how it compares to Bitcoin, and why our federal government wants to introduce a digital asset pegged to the U.S. dollar into our banking system. 2025 will also be remembered as the year that sports betting, event betting, and predictive markets went mainstream. Americans are expected to wager over $150 billion in 2025, and with more states legalizing sports betting, bet on that number to grow. As it does, our readers wanted to learn more about the high-risk, high-reward parlay bet, which links together two or more individual bets, known as legs, but only pays out if every leg wins. While there weren’t any major convictions or charges of insider trading in 2025, our readers were searching for what it actually means and whether it was happening in front of us on several occasions this year. This term received extra attention in early April following the so-called “Liberation Day,” as the U.S. imposed reciprocal tariffs on hundreds of trading partners, leading to a near 5% selloff in the S&P 500. As the stock market went on to fall as much as 19% in the subsequent days, the President’s post telling Americans to “Buy Stocks” just before he lifted or paused many of those tariffs on April 9th raised more than a few eyebrows, especially as the market roared back to record highs. Reports of government officials selling stocks before Liberation Day surfaced soon after, but charges were never filed. While technically not a financial term, Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, better known as ‘Bad Bunny,’ got as much attention for his business acumen and net worth as he did for his latest best-selling album. 2025 was a good year for Bad Bunny’s money, as he was Spotify’s most-streamed artist, sold out arenas around the world, including a residency in his home country of Puerto Rico, hosted SNL, and was selected to be the headline act at the Super Bowl in 2026. His net worth, according to our latest report, is $88 million, and climbing. Kevin Winter / Getty Images The private markets, which include private capital and private equity, were once an exclusive playground for institutional and well-heeled accredited investors. Inherently opaque, often risky, but tempting with upside potential, private markets have received a public reception from the new administration, which is lowering regulatory hurdles to allow them into defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s and IRAs. In August, President Trump signed an executive order to ‘democratize’ access to alternative investments, such as private markets, paving the way for their inclusion in retirement plans. Our readers sought to learn everything they could about private markets and their potential impact on their portfolios. One of the simplest strategies to generate income in the stock market this year was through covered calls in the options market. The strategy involves an investor who owns a stock with no intention of selling it, does not expect the price to move significantly, and sells a call option that generates a premium for the option's term. If the stock rises in price, the investor gets their premium payment plus the increase in the stock price, up to the strike price. If the stock falls, the investor still gets the premium, which offsets some of the loss. As the stock market has been churning sideways since September, more of our readers have wanted to learn and use this strategy.

Title: Rivian's Stock Pops Friday. The EV Maker Is Leaning Into Autonomy and AI

Are investors ready to buy into Rivian's vision for its autonomous vehicles and AI? Shares of the electric vehicle maker surged 12% Friday, erasing yesterday's losses after an "Autonomy & AI Day" event where Rivian (RIVN) announced a custom AI chip and plans to roll out enhanced self-driving software. The move higher came during a down day for broader markets as worries about an AI bubble continued to pressure shares of big AI names such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron Technology (MU). Rivian said Thursday it will soon issue an update to its second-generation R1 vehicles that will expand the ability for hands-off driving to more than 3.5 million miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada, compared to under 150,000 miles previously. That would bring Rivian closer to Tesla's (TSLA) base Autopilot system in covering most roads in the U.S., Barclays analysts said in a note following the event. The analysts said the development, along with other updates, showcased Rivian's shift in strategy to focus more on autonomous and AI features as a way to differentiate its offerings in the face of a challenging EV market, and open up new high-margin revenue streams through subscriptions and licensing. Rivian said it plans to launch a subscription platform called Autonomy+ early next year that will deliver more advanced driving assistance features and be continuously updated as Rivian develops the software, much like Tesla's Full Self Driving (Supervised) service. Rivian expects to offer its subscription at $49.99 per month, or a one-time $2,500 purchase. Tesla's more advanced system costs $99 per month. Rivian also unveiled its own AI chip designed to replace the chips it currently buys from Nvidia (NVDA) to power its self-driving software. The Rivian chip and a LiDAR, or Light Detection and Ranging, sensor system are each expected to be approved and added to Rivian's new R2 vehicles by late next year. The company is looking to add an AI voice assistant to first and second-generation R1 vehicles early next year. While Rivian shares slipped Thursday after its new autonomy projects were announced, amid a broader pullback in tech and AI stocks, Friday's gains and positive comments from analysts could point to renewed enthusiasm for the electric vehicle maker's stock. Barclays analysts told clients that while there are a number technical hurdles for Rivian to clear as it looks to catch up with Tesla and other self-driving competitors, they "appreciate this strategy, reflecting the strength of RIVN’s efforts in vertical integration, and reminding us that aside from Tesla, they are taking clear efforts to lead on software-defined vehicles in the west." While Rivian did not explicitly include plans for a fleet of robotaxis in Thursday's presentation, CEO RJ Scaringe hinted that the company's efforts in self-driving could also enable Rivian to pursue rideshare opportunities in the future. Offering a robotaxi service or providing its vehicles to ridesharing services once they are capable of self-driving would put Rivian in closer competition with Tesla, which launched a test pilot of its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas earlier this year. While still well off their highs in 2021, Rivian shares have climbed close to 40% in 2025, outpacing the S&P 500's 16% gain. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent price values.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares (NYSEARCA:SOXS) offers a contrarian bet against the AI boom, delivering three times the inverse daily performance of semiconductor stocks. While the ETF has attracted attention for its dividend distributions, understanding how this fund generates income reveals why it’s fundamentally different from traditional dividend investments. SOXS doesn’t hold semiconductor stocks or collect dividends from companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Instead, the fund uses derivatives including swaps and futures to achieve -3x daily exposure to the ICE Semiconductor Index. Approximately 66% of the fund’s $1.1 billion in assets sits in cash collateral, primarily Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Treasury Instruments, generating interest income. Additional distributions come from gains when semiconductor stocks decline and the fund profits from short positions. The fund paid $0.056 per share in its September 2025 distribution. Based on the current price of $2.95, this translates to an annualized yield of approximately 7.6%. Some sources cite yields approaching 20% by projecting forward based on historical volatility in distributions, which ranged from $0.056 to $0.185 quarterly throughout 2025. SOXS distributions are highly unstable because they depend on two volatile factors: interest rates on cash collateral and gains from semiconductor stock declines. When semiconductors rally, as they have throughout 2025, the fund generates minimal profits from short positions while experiencing severe price decay from daily rebalancing costs. The fund’s 0.97% expense ratio and daily reset mechanism create structural headwinds. SOXS has declined 87% year-to-date in 2025, falling from $22.12 to $2.95. Over five years, the fund has lost 99.86% of its value. A 10% yield provides little consolation when the underlying ETF loses 87% of its value. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Stock Market Live December 12: Trump to Ease Marijuana Regulation, S&P 500 (VOO) Flat

Get earnings reminders, our top analysis on Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, market updates, and brand-new stock recommendations delivered directly to your inbox. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian downgraded PayPal (Nasdaq: PYPL) stock to neutral with a $66 price target this morning. “We were already below consensus for 2026 and 2027 EPS,” notes Sebastian, and now “we think that a combination of uneven transaction volumes thus far in Q4, along with another investment cycle on tap in 2026, and uncertain timing around broader platform improvements mean that a ‘clearing event’ is less likely near term.” It’s not entirely clear what he means by that, but in the context of a downgrade, it certainly doesn’t sound like good news! Most likely, Sebastian is looking for clear signs that PayPal’s business is on the upswing — and he doesn’t expect to see any. “We remain constructive longer term given opportunities to improve branded checkout, accelerate Venmo monetization,” admits the analyst. Still, until PayPal shows it’s gaining market share and showing better revenue growth, it seems this analyst won’t be recommending anyone buy PayPal stock. PayPal stock is down 0.6% on the report. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is down 1.5% today. Camping- and fishing-goods supplier Johnson Outdoors (Nasdaq: JOUT) missed earnings by a massive $2.15 this morning, reporting a fiscal Q4 2025 loss of $2.83 per share. This was despite beating revenue estimates with sales of $135.8 million. Losses did improve year over year (meaning Johnson Outdoors lost a bit less money), but didn’t improve as much as Wall Street wanted. Shares of the stock aren’t down too much considering the size of the miss, though, only about 3%. Warehouse store operator Costco (Nasdaq: COST) beat by 22 cents last night, reporting fiscal Q1 2026 earnings of $4.50 per share. Sales likewise exceeded expectations at $67.3 billion. Same store sales at Costco grew a solid 6.4% year over year. At the same time, Costco is growing sales through new store openings. Costco plans to open about 30 new stores annually going forward (net of old store closings) — not that the company necessarily needs more physical locations. E-commerce sales through Costco’s website, says the company, grew 24% in the quarter. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) ended up gaining a modest 0.25% on Thursday, one day after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by the expected… 0.25%. Just a coincidence, I’m sure. And it’s a coincidence, too, that with zero interest rate cuts remaining in 2025, the Voo is exactly flat premarket today. That doesn’t mean there’s no news to report, however. The biggest news today, for a certain class of investors at least, is that The Washington Post is reporting President Trump plans to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug, significantly easing restrictions on the drug’s possession and use. From an investing perspective, this will permit banks to service marijuana companies and states to regulate the drug. Trump could issue his order as soon as next month, reports CNBC, and new federal regulations could issue from the Drug Enforcement Agency as early as this coming summer. Shares of leading cannabis stocks such as Aurora Cannabis (Nasdaq: ACB), Canopy Growth (Nasdaq: CGC), and Tilray (Nasdaq: TLRY) are soaring on the news, up 20%, 25%, and 38% premarket. Meanwhile in tech, Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) may increase production of its H200 artificial intelligence chip, its second-fastest AI chip, purpose-built for sale in China and subject to a 25% export tariff by the U.S. President Trump said Tuesday the U.S. will permit Nvidia to export H200 chips to China. Nvidia investors like the move, and Nvidia stock is up 0.5% premarket. In other tech news, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) beat earnings by eight cents last night. The chipmaker reported fiscal Q4 2025 earnings of $1.95 per share, and beat revenue estimates by $500 million with $18 billion in quarterly sales. Broadcom also guided higher for fiscal Q1 2026, saying revenue should be $19.1 billion, also ahead of estimates — but apparently not ahead enough. Broadcom shares are down 5% premarket.

Oracle's (ORCL) stock tumbled Thursday, dragging other tech stocks down along with it, a day after the cloud computing giant posted sales that missed analysts' estimates. Oracle said new agreements with AI heavyweights Meta Platforms (META) and Nvidia (NVDA) helped grow its backlog to a record $523 billion, though that failed to sway investors from selling off Thursday amid persistent worries about circular AI deals and the company's reliance on a few large customers. Shares of Oracle were down nearly 14% in recent trading. AI hardware makers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), and Broadcom (AVGO)—which is set to report earnings after the closing bell today—also lost ground. Oracle shares rallied to a record high following its earnings report in September, but the stock has given up those gains in the months since amid growing worries about an AI bubble. Oracle's stock plunge Thursday despite a record backlog and pressure on other AI-exposed stocks could be taken as a signal of weakening confidence in the AI trade. Still, most Wall Street analysts say they're standing by Oracle's stock. Though ratings are still in flux, a majority of the 12 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha consider the stock a "buy" with just three neutral ratings and one analyst advising selling the stock. William Blair analysts wrote following the report that while they expect Oracle's stock could be limited in the near term by debt concerns and spending plans, they believe its buildout "will pave the way for significant earnings growth in the years to come."

Title: Bitcoin and equity futures fall alongside mining stocks as Oracle leads AI stock decline
URL: https://blockspace.media/insight/bitcoin-and-equity-futures-fall-alongside-mining-stocks-as-oracle-leads-ai-stock-decline/
Time Published: 2025-12-11T15:09:49Z

Cryptocurrency prices and equity futures retreated on Thursday morning, signaling a negative start for major indices. Bitcoin fell 2.11% to $90,090, setting a bearish tone for digital asset miners, while a sharp decline in Oracle shares weighed heavily on the broader AI sector. Bitcoin mining equities tracked the drop in spot cryptocurrency prices, facing widespread losses in pre-market trading. CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) and Hut 8 (NASDAQ: HUT) led the decline, falling 3.03% and 3.19%, respectively. MARA (NASDAQ: MARA) dropped 2.6%, while TeraWulf (NASDAQ: WULF) and IREN (NASDAQ: IREN) posted losses of roughly 2.5% each. Other industry participants followed the sector-wide sell-off. Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT) dropped 2.38%, Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) declined 2.02%, and Americant Bitcoin (Nasdaq: ABTC) fell 1.04%. Artificial intelligence stocks faced significant selling pressure, driven primarily by Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), which plummeted 13.18%. A Reuters report on December 11 revealed that the sell-off came after Oracle’s quarterly cloud revenue miss, despite year-over-year growth. Compounding investor concerns, the company raised its capital expenditure outlook to $50 billion for 2026 to fund AI infrastructure, a move market observers noted would add to an existing debt load. The negative sentiment impacted other AI leaders, with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) falling 1.59%. Oracle also highlighted reliance on a limited number of large partners, such as OpenAI, raising concerns regarding concentration risk. The weakness in tech and crypto dragged down broader market futures. S&P 500 futures dropped 0.32% and Nasdaq futures decreased 0.52% in early trading hours, positioning the markets for a lower open.

Title: Nvidia’s ‘Secret Portfolio’ Is Tanking. This Is the Only Stock Still Winning

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock / rafapress Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has quietly built a strategic investment portfolio not many investors are aware of targeting companies that enhance its AI ecosystem, from chip design to data infrastructure. This “secret” portfolio holds six positions that were valued at $4.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. These stakes back firms developing complementary technologies, such as GPU-optimized cloud services and AI-driven biotech. However, Q3 brought challenges amid a broader AI market pause, with hyperscalers reassessing capex and investor sentiment cooling. The portfolio shed nearly $500 million in the quarter, an 11% drop, as four of six holdings declined, most sharply. Since Q3 ended in September, though, the slide deepened, with the overall value plunging 30% more to about $2.7 billion — a $1.1 billion loss. Only one holding defied the trend: Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD). Nvidia’s portfolio woes stem largely from its largest bet, the AI cloud provider reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for training large models, CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV). At Q2’s close, Nvidia’s 24.3 million shares were worth $3.96 billion, over 91% of the portfolio. But CoreWeave’s stock has cratered amid debt concerns and AI hype fatigue. Since Q3’s end, it’s down 36%, and 46% from Q2 levels, now trading around $88 per share after peaking at $187 earlier in 2025. This single position accounts for most of the portfolio’s quarter-over-quarter decline. Other holdings fared little better. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), a chip architecture designer, slipped 12.5% since Q3 amid slower mobile demand. Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX), using AI for drug discovery, dropped 5.7% on clinical trial delays, and WeRide (NASDAQ:WRD), an autonomous driving firm, fell 17% as regulatory hurdles mounted. The portfolio’s diversification into AI adjacencies hasn’t shielded it from sector-wide pressures like rising energy costs and delayed enterprise rollouts. Amid the rubble, two positions posted gains, with Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS) delivering solid returns. Formerly tied to former Russian search giant Yandex, Nebius now builds AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters. Nvidia’s 1.2 million shares, valued at $65.9 million at the end of Q2, have surged 69% since then, boosted by a $17 billion Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) deal for cloud capacity. Nebius’s Q3 revenue jumped 355% year-over-year to $146 million, underscoring its switch to AI hyperscaler needs. However, the stock has fallen 17% since the end of Q3. Yet Applied Digital outpaces even Nebius as the portfolio’s undisputed star. Nvidia’s 7.7 million shares, worth $77.7 million at Q2 close, have rocketed 128% quarter-over-quarter and another 35% since Q3, for a staggering 208% total gain. Now valued at over $239 million, this stake has single-handedly offset some broader losses. Applied Digital designs and operates data centers tailored for high-performance computing, powering AI and blockchain workloads. Its Polaris Forge campus in North Dakota delivers 100 megawatts of capacity, drawing clients like CoreWeave for GPU-intensive builds. In a market where AI stocks like CoreWeave and even Arm are falling, sometimes as much as 40% or more, Applied Digital’s ability to keep going stands out. Its fiscal Q1 2026 results, reported in October, crushed Wall Street estimates. Revenue hit $64.2 million, up 84% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA at $5.85 million. Net losses narrowed to $36.1 million, far better than feared. The main driver was relentless data center demand. AI training requires massive, power-efficient facilities, and Applied Digital benefits directly from hyperscaler buildouts, including contracts with CoreWeave for colocation. Its sustainable designs, using renewable energy, align with ESG mandates that pressure rivals. Crypto also added tailwinds. Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) demand spiked after the halving, especially as its price briefly soared above $126,000, contributing to increased demand for data center capacity. As pure AI plays pause amid valuation resets, Applied Digital’s hybrid model — 60% high-performance computing and AI, 40% crypto — provides a buffer. Analysts project 28% EBITDA growth in fiscal 2026, with $16 billion in existing five-year leases, giving it good visibility into revenue for the years ahead. Trading at 30x forward sales, it’s carrying a lot of investor expectations with it. Although Applied Digital is still generating losses, they narrowed significantly in Q3 and it projects an annual net operating income run rate of $1 billion by 2030. Applied Digital’s outperformance is the result of focused execution. However, its continued success depends on navigating the AI slowdown, potentially crimping data center leases if clients like Microsoft trim budgets. The crypto winter could bite as well, as Bitcoin’s near-30% pullback echoes 2022’s bear market, possibly idling mining rigs and pressuring margins. Still, the upside potential outweighs risks. Nvidia’s endorsement validates its tech, so if AI capex continues strong next year — as Nvidia forecasts it will — Applied Digital could double again. However, having tripled in six months, it’s no secret anymore: in Nvidia’s tanking portfolio, this is the winner worth watching. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Bill Gates Has a Warning for AI Investors
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/bill-gates-has-a-warning-for-ai-investors-stocks-nvidia-nvda-11866392
Time Published: 2025-12-11T14:18:48Z
Full Content:
One of America’s legendary tech founders has a warning for AI investors: They can't all be winners. “Not all of these valuations will end up going up. Some of them will go down," Bill Gates, co-founder of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT), said of AI stocks in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. "It’s going to be hyper-competitive. A reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.” Microsoft is among the tech giants whose massive investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI bubble debate raging on Wall Street. The so-called hyperscalers—Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—are expected to spend $400 billion on infrastructure—much of it dedicated to training and running AI models—this year, and more than $500 billion next year. The AI boom has been the driving force behind the stock market rally for much of the past three years. But the rally has faltered in recent months due to lofty valuations and concerns that tech giants are overspending on AI. Some experts are reminding investors to pick and choose. Some investors worry the sheer size of those figures has encouraged speculation on Wall Street, causing some AI stocks to trade at eye-watering valuations. Software firm Palantir (PLTR) has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 400, one of the highest in the S&P 500. Shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have soared this year on hopes they can take market share from AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA); those gains have nudged their PE ratios above 100, more than three times that of the S&P 500 as a whole. Then there's the cohort of unprofitable startups commanding lofty valuations in private markets. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, isn't expected to turn a profit before the end of the decade. Yet the start up was valued at $500 billion in October, which would make it the 16th largest public company in America. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales and profits of some companies, leaving their valuations relatively steady despite big stock gains. AI demand has accelerated growth in the cloud computing businesses of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, all three of which have PE ratios hovering around 30. Booming demand for Nvidia’s chips made it a $4.5 trillion company, but shares trade at a relatively modest 45 times earnings. Bubble jitters have hit tech stocks several times since ChatGPT sparked the AI craze on Wall Street. In November, the Magnificent Seven nearly entered a technical correction. Less established competitors like Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV) have performed even worse. As with past pullbacks, investors shook off valuation concerns and bought the dip, lifting tech stocks out of their slump. As of Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was just 1% off its record high from late October. Stock valuations aside, Gate said he's confident in AI's potential to transform society and power advancements in health, education, and agriculture. AI, he said, "is a technology that's deeply profound, that will reshape the world. There’s not the slightest doubt about that."

One of the hottest AI stocks appears to have more room to run. Shares of Micron Technology (MU) have surged to all-time highs this week as analysts continue to raise their targets for the memory chip maker ahead of next week's earnings report. Citi analysts on Wednesday lifted their price target to $300 from $275, now double where their target for the stock was in early September. The analysts said the increasing demand for the advanced memory chips used to run artificial intelligence models should help bring in "large capital infusions" that help Micron and other memory chip makers boost their manufacturing capabilities to meet demand. Micron shares rose more than 4% Wednesday to a record closing high of just below $264. The stock price has more than tripled since the start of the year. Micron supplies memory components to other manufacturers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), making Micron one of many beneficiaries of the AI trade. Micron is the top performing stock in the Nasdaq 100 this year, and only four stocks in the S&P 500 have posted bigger gains in 2025. Artificial intelligence companies are looking to buy the chips as fast as they can be made, leading to a shortage of memory chips that Citi analysts say is causing "unprecedented increases" in pricing, which should further boost Micron's sales and profits. Deutsche Bank analysts on Tuesday hiked their own price target to $280 from $200, calling Micron "well poised to benefit" from changes in the memory-chip market. The analysts also called Micron "particularly attractive among the memory names given its unique ability to prioritize profitability over market share in this environment." Morgan Stanley analysts raised their own price target for Micron last month to $325 from $220 after upgrading the stock in October, calling the memory chip maker a "top pick" because of how that dramatic increase in pricing for memory products could boost sales and profits in the next year, even if prices start to normalize. Analysts are largely bullish on Micron stock, but its average price target suggest that some analysts think the chip maker's stock has hit its ceiling, or are waiting until after next week's report to adjust their view. The 11 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha are split between nine "buy" and two "hold" ratings, with the average price target among those analysts at around $237.

Title: Will NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Hit $500 by 2030?
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/10/will-nvidia-nvda-stock-hit-500-by-2030/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T15:18:03Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © BING-JHEN HONG / iStock Editorial via Getty Images It’s the darling of the financial markets and the undisputed heavyweight champion among U.S.-based processor producers. Truly, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is roundly revered and to many traders, NVIDIA seems unstoppable. There are plenty of price predictions for NVDA stock, and some optimists can easily envision the share price hitting $500 by 2030. Is this too far-fetched, though? The skeptics may doubt that the rally is sustainable and might see $500 as an impossible dream. Yet, as the data will reveal, NVIDIA is a chip-making powerhouse in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). So, keep an open mind as NVIDIA stock’s upside potential is considerable. Even if it is a darling of the market, NVIDIA has its doubters. One bearish-leaning commentator is hedge fund manager Michael Burry, the subject of the film The Big Short. As Rich Duprey explained here and here, Burry compared NVIDIA to Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), the telecommunications hardware giant that fell from grace with the dot-com bust. In the late 1990s, it felt like Cisco and its shares would continue to gain value forever. Burry apparently expects NVIDIA’s market capitalization to contract in the coming years, much as Cisco’s did after the late 1990s. His company, Scion Asset Management, has even gone so far as to take a massively bearish position against NVIDIA stock by owning put options. If Burry’s comparison between NVIDIA and Cisco holds true, then NVDA stock is unlikely to reach $500 by 2030. In hindsight, the hype surrounding Cisco outpaced the actual demand for the company’s products. So, is there a demand shortfall for NVIDIA’s AI-enabled processors? From a financial standpoint, it certainly looks like there’s enough AI chip demand to keep NVIDIA flush with cash. A quick glance at NVIDIA’s third-quarter 2025 results should drive this point home. In Q3 2025, NVIDIA generated revenue totaling $57.006 billion, versus $35.082 billion in the year-earlier quarter. That’s a 62.5% improvement, and most of the third-quarter 2025 revenue ($51.215 billion) was from NVIDIA’s Data Center segment. Thus, the demand for NVIDIA’s AI-compatible products isn’t lacking. Furthermore, NVIDIA’s net income grew 65.3% year over year, from $19.309 billion to $31.91 billion. In other words, the company is raking in a lot more capital than it’s spending. Looking ahead, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang proclaimed that the company’s Blackwell chip sales are “off the charts” and that its cloud GPUs are sold out. Therefore, NVIDIA in 2025 doesn’t appear to be in the same precarious position that Cisco was in 1999. The skeptics might argue that NVIDIA can’t possibly expand its sales much more than it already has. However, a recent U.S.-China trade agreement indicates that NVIDIA may have new horizons to conquer. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump is allowing NVIDIA to sell its H200 AI chips to China. Trump, according to the Journal, specified that Washington would collect 25% of NVIDIA’s sales from China. If all goes according to plan, NVIDIA stands to gain on a grand scale. The company estimated, per the Journal that it “could ship up to $5 billion in orders to China” per quarter “without geopolitical constraints.” The implications go beyond short-term revenue prospects. It’s now inarguable that the current administration values NVIDIA and seeks to protect the company’s interests. It’s unknown whether the next presidential administration will be quite as business-friendly toward NVIDIA. Nonetheless, the current administration will presumably be in place until January of 2029, and this is probably good news for NVIDIA and its shareholders. Given the pace of NVIDIA’s sales and income growth, investors should expect the company’s market cap to expand during the next five years. Unless NVIDIA actually collapses like Cisco once did, the path of least resistance for NVDA stock is to the upside. Sure, NVIDIA stock has already rallied 33% over the past year. But again, on a year-over-year basis, the company’s net sales and revenue rose 62.5% and 65.3%, respectively. Besides, those growth figures reflect a time before the President green-lit the chip sales to China. Hence, there’s still room for NVIDIA to expand its sales scope and, ultimately, its economic moat. All in all, Berry’s catastrophic AI chip market implosion scenario looks like a long shot. The financial data and the government’s apparent motivation to protect NVIDIA’s interests put the odds in the shareholders’ favor. Consequently, NVIDIA’s growth trajectory should persist through 2030 and NVDA stock’s pathway to $500 is clear, albeit not guaranteed. That’s why it’s sensible to own a few, but not too many, NVIDIA shares for the long run. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: QYLD Turns Mag 7 Tech Stocks Into an 11% Dividend Yield
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/10/qyld-turns-mag-7-tech-stocks-into-an-11-dividend-yield/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T14:48:19Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (NASDAQ:QYLD) transforms the Nasdaq-100’s top technology stocks into an 11% monthly dividend by selling covered call options against its holdings. Unlike traditional dividend ETFs, QYLD generates income exclusively through option premiums. The fund sells near-the-money call options on its entire portfolio each month, collecting premiums from buyers who purchase the right to buy shares at specific strike prices. This strategy produces consistent monthly income but caps upside participation when tech stocks rally sharply. The fund’s $8 billion portfolio concentrates heavily in technology at 57% of the total ETF, and communication services at 17%. The top holdings – Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Broadcom, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms – represent over half the fund and drive most option premium generation. QYLD’s 11.5% yield depends entirely on market volatility, not underlying dividends. The fund’s top holdings pay minimal natural yields: NVDA offers just 0.02%, AAPL 0.37%, and MSFT 0.70%. Amazon pays no dividend. This means QYLD’s monthly distributions fluctuate based on option premium levels, which compress during low-volatility periods. Recent dividend history reveals declining payouts. Monthly distributions averaged $0.198 in 2021 but have dropped 17% to approximately $0.169 currently. This decline reflects lower implied volatility in tech stocks as markets stabilized following pandemic-era swings. When volatility decreases, call options command lower premiums, directly reducing QYLD’s distributable income. The fund’s structure also creates total return concerns. While delivering high current income, QYLD’s net asset value has eroded 23% from its December 2021 peak of $22.82 to the current $17.54. This capital depreciation occurs because covered calls cap participation in bull market rallies. When tech stocks surge—as they did throughout 2023-2024—QYLD surrenders upside gains beyond strike prices. Investors receive steady income but miss appreciation that Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) holders capture fully. The concentration in highly valued tech stocks adds risk. NVDA trades at 46 times earnings with a beta of 2.28, creating extreme volatility that generates premiums but exposes the fund to sharp drawdowns. The April 2025 drop to $14.48 demonstrated this downside vulnerability. Income reliability remains strong—QYLD has paid monthly since 2013 without interruption. However, distribution amounts fluctuate with market conditions, and the declining trend suggests caution for investors expecting stable 11% yields indefinitely. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPI) offers a more diversified approach to option income generation. Rather than concentrating in tech-heavy Nasdaq stocks, JEPI writes calls on a broader S&P 500-based portfolio with lower volatility stocks. The fund currently yields approximately 7.4% with more stable monthly distributions and less exposure to mega-cap tech concentration risk. JEPI combines equity-linked notes with covered calls, providing flexibility to adjust option strategies based on market conditions while maintaining consistent income generation.
