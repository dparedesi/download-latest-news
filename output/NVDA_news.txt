This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The investor appetite for big food stocks is as thin as I was back in the mid-1980s. Note in that time period I was about five years old. "From a generalist investor standpoint, I would say it has been pretty quiet [around packaged food names]. Your typical kind of institutional money has been quieter in the space," youthful, energetic packaged food analyst at Bank of America Peter Galbo said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below). The way Galbo explained it to me, investors are in search of faster-growth stocks ahead of a prolonged stretch of Fed rate cuts. Think of the desire to devour Nvidia (NVDA) shares on any dip, as opposed to eating up General Mills (GIS) on a pullback. You can easily see that in some Yahoo Finance-sourced data. Nvidia's stock is up a sizzling 168% year to date. General Mills is only up 10%. PepsiCo (PEP) and Conagra Brands (CAG) are both up roughly 2%. Hormel (HRL) is down 4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up 21% this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) 13%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) 20%. But as I digested (pun intended) my in-depth chat with Galbo, I think there are a few other fundamental reasons that are keeping these companies out of investor shopping baskets (pun also intended). Your shopping list of explanations: The companies are still too big inside an investing world that's no longer rewarding the conglomerate model. Investors want focused strategies executing at the highest level. For instance, does Conagra Brands need to be selling frozen food and also hawking Slim Jim and Duke's meat snacks? Should Spam maker Hormel have purchased the Planters nut business from Kraft Heinz (KHC) a few years ago? The companies want to get even bigger despite investors not rewarding the play! Conagra Brands just purchased the Fatty meat snacks line. The company now has the meat snacks market cornered with Slim Jim, Duke's, and Fatty. Galbo tells me meat snacks are a growth category in snacking. Fair, but I question why one must own three meat snack brands! The companies are slow to slim down their slower-growth businesses. Only recently did General Mills sell off its North American yogurt business for $2 billion. Campbell Soup is hunting for a buyer for the Noosa yogurt business it got with its Rao's business. I didn't get the sense from Hormel's latest earnings call it's going to sell the Planters business amid signs the deal may not be working out as planned. Consumers are pissed off at Big Food for its pricing strategies and are voicing their views by purchasing less. You saw that in PepsiCo's volumes this week. The cumulative effects of four years of inflation continue to pressure so many households. Buying snacks is now a luxury. Traffic at convenience store stores has really trailed off the past year for economic reasons, but shopping has also shifted to club stores such as Costco (COST). Convenience store channels need to be doing well for a lot of food players to do well. The Ozempic threat on the long-term health of Big Food earnings power is rising every single day as new users of these drugs enter the market. Bonus reason: The stocks aren't valued for the realities listed above. They are still being seen as defensive value plays since the companies sell food. That's the wrong way to think about it, I believe — it's hard to defend Hormel trading at almost 19 times forward earnings, which isn't too far removed from the S&P 500's forward multiple around 21 times. An old rule of thumb in investing is that a 15 times forward P/E multiple is on the attractive side (I caution this is not always the case and each company is unique, so don't use my line as gospel). Then, there is raw commentary that I would argue is weighing on the sector's multiples. First up: These companies have become political punching bags this election season. Vice President Kamala Harris has vowed to tackle price gouging by Big Food if she wins the White House in November. Senator Elizabeth Warren has been making the rounds talking about shrinkflation and taking food companies to task for it. All of this rhetoric doesn't exactly embolden investors to go search for diamonds in the rough in the food space. There is also what we are hearing from consumer company executives, which suggests a strong rebound in sales and earnings isn't guaranteed in 2025. "We see that [the] consumer is very challenged, and that the consumer is making a lot of decisions. They're optimizing their full budget, so they might be cutting on food to pay for their subscriptions, or they might be cutting on food to go to see movies on the weekend. Really, there is a lot of trade-offs they're making when it comes to food." PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta told me this past week moments after earnings hit the wires. The company trimmed its full-year sales outlook. This aligns with what Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon told me last week at the retailer's Bentonville, Ark., HQ. "People at lower income levels are always more challenged. They have to make trade-off decisions, and that's been, I think, more acute since this inflationary cycle on the heels of the pandemic. So, a household income below $100,000 feels pressure in a way that they might not have a few years ago, and you can see that in their behavior. And we are trying to get prices down ... some of the more stubborn inflation has been in the prepared foods, dry grocery type, consumable categories, like paper goods, cleaning supplies," McMillon said. I wish Big Food well in regaining the hunger of investors. After all, these companies do feed the planet. It will be tough, however.

Title: What To Watch As Third-Quarter 2024 Earnings Season Begins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/13/what-to-watch-as-third-quarter-2024-earnings-season-begins/
Time Published: 2024-10-13T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Earnings growth is expected to decelerate to a 4.4% year-over-year pace in the third quarter from ... [+] the double-digit pace of the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, earnings growth was expected to decelerate to a 4.4% year-over-year pace in the third quarter from the double-digit pace of the second quarter. Topline sales were forecasted to grow by 4.7% year-over-year in the third quarter. Forward earnings guidance will be crucial as consensus earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year 2025 were predicted to increase by 14.8% and 15%, respectively. S&P 500 Earnings Estimates Earnings season began last Friday with a handful of companies, dominated by financials, reporting earrings. 44 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report earnings this week, heavily emphasizing banks, but many industries are represented. Among the banks reporting are Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and PNC Financial (PNC). There are a smattering of other companies on the calendar, like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), CSX (CSX), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Progressive (PGR). S&P 500 Earnings Season JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) reported better-than-expected earnings last Friday, getting the bank earnings season off to a good start. According to FactSet, the blended earnings growth rate for the financial sector increased to 1.6% from -0.7% year-over-year due to the better earnings from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. The pace of loan growth for the banking industry has been slow, which should weigh on earnings growth. However, investment banking and wealth management revenues continue to benefit from strong markets, benefitting earnings at the money center banks relative to smaller banks. Bank Loan Growth The technology sector should report the most robust earnings growth at 15.5% year-over-year. NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA) should be the most significant contributor to the sector’s earnings. NVIDIA’s profits are expected to soar by 84% year-over-year on the strength of demand for artificial intelligence semiconductors. According to FactSet, the sector’s earnings growth would be 7.5% without the boost from NVIDIA. After some poor headline growth numbers for healthcare due primarily to acquisition-related write-offs, the sector should show some earnings life this quarter at 11.2% year-over-year growth. Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Moderna (MRNA) are expected to be the primary drivers of the profit increase, according to FactSet. The communications services sector rounds out the top three in forecasted year-over-year earnings growth at 10.5%. Not surprisingly, Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to be responsible for most of the growth. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector The energy sector earnings are forecasted to have the worst showing for the third quarter, with a 19.1% year-over-year decline. Natural gas and oil prices fell, resulting in an expected decline in revenues for the energy industry. Energy Commodities Two of Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKA, BRKB) top ten largest publicly traded stock holdings are Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Chevron (CVX). Berkshire has amassed an almost 28% stake in Occidental. A previous piece discussed why Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway favors Occidental Petroleum. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Sales growth is typically closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Estimated 5% nominal year-over-year economic growth supports the consensus estimate of a 4.7% year-over-year sales increase for the S&P 500 with some upside. GDP Growth Drives S&P 500 Sales Despite a more challenging start to the year, the pace of inflation growth has seen a general downtrend, which should help earnings this quarter. U.S. CPI Year-Over-Year The differential in price growth for producer’s input costs (PPI) versus the price increases hitting consumers (CPI) indicates that profit margins should be able to hold steady or increase this quarter. The topline sales growth, driven by economic activity in the quarter and supportive margins, allows positive year-over-year earnings growth expectations. Margins & Inflation The slightly weaker U.S. dollar could positively impact earnings growth from multinational companies this quarter. With approximately 40% of the sales of S&P 500 companies coming from international sources, the dollar can impact profits for companies selling products internationally. U.S. Dollar Softens Following the robust monthly jobs report, the markets repriced the pace of expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. Fed Fund futures now indicate a slightly less than 100% probability of a 25 basis point (0.25%) cut in November and December. The September retail sales reading on Thursday is the next significant indicator of the strength of the U.S. consumer and economy. Fed Rate Cuts Expected The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have continued to outperform the less sensitive defensives, implying that stocks are pricing in a higher probability that the U.S. avoids an economic recession. The relative performance of cyclicals versus defensives is nearing the trailing one-year high, reached in mid-July 2024. Cyclicals Versus Defensives The third quarter’s mid-single-digit year-over-year earnings gains provide a seemingly low hurdle for this earnings season. The profit growth should be achievable, assisted by topline sales boosted by solid economic growth. With the fear of recession fading reflected in stock prices and faster earnings growth expected for the fourth quarter and 2025, more attention will likely be paid to management’s future earnings guidance than the third quarter’s earnings beats. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), CSX (CSX), Wells Fargo (WFC), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), NVIDIA (NVDA), Chevron (CVX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: ETF Investors Shrug Off Market Uncertainties, Bullish on Mag 7, Schwab Survey Finds

Market volatility, high interest rates, inflation and the upcoming presidential election haven't affected the investment strategies of most exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors. Most ETF investors surveyed by Charles Schwab (SCHW) Asset Management said that these economic and political events did not change the way they invest in ETFs. In fact, roughly a third of the investors put more money into ETFs based on their reading of stock market volatility, high interest rates and persistent inflation, according to the survey results released this week. ETFs have a track record across market cycles, said David Botset, Managing Director, Head of Innovation and Stewardship at Schwab Asset Management, adding that "investors are confident in their investments even when the outlook is uncertain.” ETF investors have grown more bullish on certain types of stocks and sectors since last year: 69% are bullish on technology and 60% on growth stocks. Additionally, 55% of investors are optimistic about the the Magnificent 7, a group of seven mega-cap technology companies including Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). The Mag 7 stocks have a big influence on the stock markets and have driven much of the S&P 500's returns over the past year. But when they falter, as they did in July this year, they tend to drag the broader stock market down with them. The survey also showed how investment preferences vary across generations. For instance, 62% of millennials (or those born between 1981 and 1996), said they plan to invest in cryptocurrency ETFs over the next year versus 15% of Boomers (or those born between 1946 and 1964). A quarter of millennials said they plan to invest in alternatives ETFs, compared with just 11% of boomers. At the same time, 44% of millennials also want to increase their exposure to lower-risk fixed income ETFs. In contrast, fewer GenX (34%) and Boomer (26%) investors plan to do likewise. This is in line with other recent studies that point to recent stock market volatility making millennials more risk-averse compared to some older generations.

Title: How Interest Rates Will Impact This 7%+ Closed-End Fund

Small Cap write on sticky notes isolated on Office Desk. Stock market concept Normally when interest rates fall, we closed-end fund (CEF) investors are tempted to pick up a fund like the 7.3%-paying Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT). It seems like a particularly savvy move today, with this small cap–focused CEF trading at a 10.3% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Cheap! But is that really a good value, or could RVT get cheaper still? Let’s take a look, starting with small caps generally. Like large caps, they benefit as lower rates boost consumer spending. But there are two other factors that make falling-rate periods particularly advantageous for smaller firms: With that in mind—plus the fact that small caps tend to be more domestic-focused, helping shield them from global instability—you’d think investors would’ve bid them to the moon this year, right? Well, not so much. Small Caps Lag So far, traders aren’t calling for a small-cap rebound, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), in purple above, trailing the benchmark S&P 500 ETF (in orange). (IWM invests in all 2000 small caps that make up the primary US small-cap index, the Russell 2000.) We normally love a contrarian setup like this at my CEF Insider service, but this time I think the herd has a point. It’s true that lower rates encourage people to spend more. But remember too that rates tend to be cut during a recession. And in a recession, Americans are already cutting spending. So lower rates do tend to push up consumer spending in those times—albeit from an already-low base. However, when Americans are already spending a lot, as they are today, cutting rates won’t necessarily do much. Spending Ticks Higher As you can see above, the big jump in interest rates we’ve seen, from near nothing to 5.5% in just 18 months, didn’t slow consumer-spending growth. So it doesn’t make sense that consumer spending will grow with lower rates; that’s usually the case, but probably won’t be this time. What about the buying-on-margin story? That idea is a bit broken, too. Margin Loans, Interest Rates As you can see, the lower cost of borrowing on margin (related to the federal funds rate, in red above) made for a huge amount of margin borrowing (the blue line) during the pandemic. But margin balances went back to their normal trend in 2022, when rates rose. This, by the way, is the main reason why stocks tanked that year. In other words, the market has already gotten to a “normal” level of margin borrowing. Rates falling from 5% to 3%, where the Fed has said it wants them to settle, isn’t going to cause that speculative buying of small-cap stocks like we saw shortly after the pandemic—or for that matter, in the 2010s, when rates were also low. That also means this chart is unlikely to repeat itself. IWM Tracks SPY In the low-rate 2010s, small caps started from being oversold during the Great Recession. But even with the low starting point, they merely tracked the S&P 500. In other words, investing in small caps based on the idea that others will borrow to invest in them wasn’t a great move when rates were at 0.25%, let alone 3%. Which leads me to the final point: small caps’ investments in innovation. Technology has become a big part of the total US stock market because tech firms have provided tremendous innovation over the last decade: Companies from across the economy depend more on Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and the like more than ever. That trend has been running since the end of the dot-com bubble. The current scramble among big firms to integrate AI just exacerbates it. And that’s why the top constituents of IWM, the main small-cap index fund, are a worry. IWM Top Holdings There are good companies in here, like FTAI Aviation (FTAI), which repairs and maintains jet engines. But, as a few industry reports note (like this one and this one), the big aviation firms, like Boeing (BA) and Airbus, already use AI to improve their aircraft-maintenance services. So smaller firms like FTAI will need to invest in cutting-edge AI tech to compete. That’s squeezes smaller companies’ profits more than those of larger firms. But the main winners are those that provide the AI infrastructure both the FTAIs and Boeings need—companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) and NVIDIA (NVDA). This brings us back to RVT. While its yield sounds great, at 7.3%, it’s actually low for CEFs, which yield 8.2% on average. And while we love being contrarians at CEF Insider, in this case we can’t be, since RVT’s past performance shows that it should actually be cheaper. Let me explain. RVT Total Returns Price RVT’s market price (in purple above) has been beating IWM by a healthy margin over the last decade. But if we compare IWM to RVT’s total NAV return, which reflects the actual performance of the CEF’s managers, things look different. RVT Total Returns NAV RVT has actually been tracking the small-cap index for a long time, and if its discount falls to 15% or lower, that’d be a great entry point. But at a 10.3% discount, given its 10-year average discount of 11.1%, RVT is still not a great deal for us. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) may have disappointed investors with its Advancing AI event Thursday, but analysts said they're still bullish on the chipmaker's growth prospects. While AMD unveiled a number of new AI products at the event, Jefferies analysts said investors may have been looking for clearer signs of competition with Nvidia (NVDA) and a new customer announcement, as well as "the potential for a raise of the AI guidance to $5 billion, which is likely now left to earnings." Shares of AMD fell 4% Thursday after the event, though they recovered some of those losses with a just over 2% gain Friday. Bank of America analysts said AMD's latest Instinct MI325X GPU “remains a full year behind NVDA's latest Blackwell, with no near-term catalyst to change the dynamic." Jefferies analysts suggested AMD's MI350 next year "would compete more favorably" with Nvidia's Blackwell, "leaving AMD chasing NVDA for now." However, the analysts said they believe AMD's new AI chips could still "drive further share gains" as companies race to build out their AI infrastructure, with "enough demand to go around." Jefferies maintained its "buy" rating for the stock and price target of $190, a more than 13% premium over Friday's closing price of $167.89. Bank of America also maintained a "buy" rating with a price objective of $180. About three-quarters or 13 of the other 17 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha also held "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock as of Friday, with a consensus target of $192.13.

Title: Treasury Yields Have Been Rising. How Might That Affect Your Stock Portfolio?

The yield on 10-year Treasurys crossed 4.1% for the first time since July this week, extending an ascent that has paradoxically coincided with the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen by about half a percentage point since dipping below 3.6% on Sept. 17, the day before the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark federal funds rate from its highest level in more than 20 years. Stock investors are often unnerved by rising yields for a few reasons. First, they draw money away from the stock market and lower stock valuations by increasing the yield on lower-risk fixed-income securities. Second, they discourage consumer and business borrowing, weighing on economic growth and corporate profits in the process. Yet rising Treasury yields haven't stood in the way of stocks in recent weeks. The S&P 500 on Friday closed at its 45th record high of the year as the 10-year yield was at a two-month high. Major stock indexes have posted gains in five consecutive weeks. Stocks have been supported lately by growing conviction on Wall Street that the U.S. economy’s strength can support corporate profits. Earnings have mostly held up through years of elevated interest rates, and the Fed’s easing cycle—whether aggressive or more measured—should mostly be a tailwind for business and stocks. Bank of America analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 15% next year. They also forecast growth will continue to broaden beyond the Magnificent Seven—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—which accounted for an outsized share of the index’s earnings growth and market performance in 2023. The "Other 493," the earnings of which were declining or stagnant throughout 2023 and early 2024, are expected to record double-digit earnings growth in each of the next five quarters. According to one study from British asset manager Schroders, rising yields compressed stock valuations in 6 of the 11 periods between 1970 and 2021 that they characterize as "rising yield environments." And yet stocks advanced in all but two of those periods because earnings grew fast enough to offset lower valuations. Few experts expect the 10-year yield to rise much further than it already has, another reason yields are unlikely to derail the bull market. “The US economy is healthy & unlikely to see recession near term but it also doesn't appear to be meaningfully re-accelerating,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a recent note. They expect the Fed to continue cutting rates next year, and forecast the 10-year yield will sit around 3.75% at the end of both 2024 and 2025. Lawrence Gillum, Chief Fixed Income Strategist at LPL Financial, sees a little more room for rates to tick up but still expects yields to fluctuate within a 3.75-4.25% range throughout the rest of the year. The surprising strength of the U.S. economy is a key reason for the peculiar divergence between interest rates and yields. The unemployment rate declined in September when the U.S. added far more jobs than expected, according to data from the Labor Department released last week. And inflation ran slightly hot in September, according to data released Thursday. That’s led Wall Street to doubt the Fed will need to continue aggressively cutting rates to prevent an economic crisis. Last month, the prevailing view among market participants was that the Fed would lower rates by another 75 basis points (0.75%) before the end of the year. Now, the market sees no chance the Fed will move that quickly, according to fed fund futures trading data. As the outlook for interest rates has changed, so has the market price of Treasurys and, subsequently, their yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices. When investors think that interest rates are going to be lower in the future than they are now, that increases the price—and decreases the yield—of Treasurys trading on the secondary market because they’re expected to pay a higher coupon than future debt. The opposite happens when investors think interest rates will be higher in the future, and the strength of recent labor market data has convinced Wall Street of that.

Title: What Happens When a Stock Is Dropped From the S&P 500?

Time Published: 2024-10-11T17:11:35Z

Being listed on the S&P 500 is a hallmark of success for many companies, symbolizing market leadership and investor confidence. However, it's not uncommon for companies to sometimes be delisted from this prestigious index. In fact, the average life span of a company on the S&P 500 is about years. Delisting can occur for several reasons and may have immediate negative consequences for the company and its investors, affecting stock prices and market perceptions. Understanding what happens when a stock is delisted from the S&P 500 is crucial for investors and stakeholders. Read on to better understand the reasons behind delisting, its impact, and how recent examples shed light on this aspect of the stock market. The S&P 500, short for Standard & Poor's 500, is one of the most widely followed stock market indexes in the world. It represents the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 is considered one of the main benchmarks of the U.S. stock market's health and performance. The index is host to many of the world's most important companies and household names, including the following (by market cap weight as of the fourth quarter of 2024): The S&P 500 has specific criteria for including companies in the index. While the choice by S&P 500 about inclusion is more than just specific measures, these are the main thresholds a company must meet: The S&P 500 is not simply a list of the 500 largest companies by market capitalization. The inclusion process involves careful consideration by the index committee. They meet quarterly to review which companies to add or drop. The committee also monitors for significant developments (such as mergers, bankruptcies, or restructuring) that might affect index composition. While meeting the inclusion criteria is necessary, it doesn't guarantee being included. The committee has discretion when adding new companies. When adding or removing companies, the committee aims to decrease index turnover while ensuring the index represents the large-cap U.S. equity market. The index's composition changes are typically announced with several days' notice. This allows index funds and other market participants time to prepare for the change. Companies can be removed from the S&P 500 for various reasons, which we can broadly categorize into voluntary and involuntary delistings: Some companies delist themselves from the S&P 500 or other major indexes. Reasons for voluntary delisting include the following: More commonly, companies are involuntarily removed from the S&P 500 because of failing to meet the index's criteria. Reasons can include the following: When a stock is removed from the S&P 500, it typically has significant effects on the stock and its investors. Short-Term Consequences: Long-Term Consequences: Companies that fall out of the S&P 500 can be included again. For example, Dell was in the S&P 500 before going private in 2013. The company was relisted in the index Sept. 23, 2024, to mark its 40th anniversary. Being added to the S&P 500 is often a significant achievement for a company. It brings several benefits, many of which are the opposite of being removed from the index: Here are several of the major companies removed from the index in 2024: Whirlpool, a major U.S. manufacturer of home appliances, was removed from the S&P 500 index in early 2024. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of American Airlines (AAL) from the S&P 500 in 2024 reflected broader challenges facing the airline industry and the company's specific financial struggles. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of Etsy Inc. (ETSY) from the S&P 500 was driven by changes in consumer behavior and ever more competition in ecommerce. Reasons for delisting: Effects: Other companies removed from the S&P 500 in 2024 include the following firms: As companies are moved out of the S&P 500 index, new companies are added to take their place. In 2024, the following were some of those added: You don't get your money back when a stock is removed from the index. You still own the same number of shares in the company. However, the value of those shares may decrease, and it may become more difficult to sell them. Index funds are mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. It provides investors with broad market exposure and typically offers lower fees than actively managed funds, as it simply mimics the composition of the chosen index rather than trying to outperform it. This depends on your investment strategy and the specific circumstances of the stock's removal. Stock prices are often negatively affected following its removal. In any case, it's important to reassess the company's fundamentals and prospects. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice if needed. Being delisted from the S&P 500 is a significant event for any company, often leading to immediate and negative consequences, such as a drop in stock price and reduced visibility. It can be voluntary because of a merger, going private, a falling market cap, or not meeting other index criteria. However, it's important to remember that delisting doesn't necessarily mean a company is doomed to fail. Some companies use this as a chance to restructure, refocus, and potentially return more robust than before. For investors, a stock's delisting from the S&P 500 should prompt a careful reassessment of the investment.

Intel INTC shares have largely been disappointing in 2024, unable to fully join the semiconductor trade and down more than 50%. Quarterly results have added fuel to the fire sale, with the stock unable to find any meaningful traction post-earnings. Below is a chart illustrating the YTD performance of Intel shares relative to the S&P 500, with its quarterly releases illustrated by the circled arrows. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Given the steep decline from highs, could it finally be time to go on the offensive and pick up some shares? Let’s take a closer look. Currently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish earnings estimate revisions from analysts. Expectations for its current fiscal year have been notably negative, with the $0.27 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 85% over the last year. The negative revisions, caused by unfavorable quarterly results, bode poorly for near-term share performance. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Still, it’s worth noting that CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident, buying 12.5k shares at a total transaction value of roughly $250k in early August following the latest quarterly print. He noted that second-half trends are more challenging than anticipated but still expects the company to restrengthen its position in the market. Cost-cutting measures have also been a huge focus for the company over recent periods after margin pressures, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, Intel announced a $10 billion cost-savings target earlier in August. Please note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Investors should stay on the sidelines until positive earnings estimate revisions roll in, which would signal a meaningful change in sentiment. Earnings expectations for its upcoming release expected on October 24th have already been slashed, with the company now expected to post a loss of -$0.03 per share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. It’s worth noting that INTC shares have been red-hot over the last month, gaining nearly 20%. While the positive price action has been inspiring, the bulk of the move has likely been fueled by a short squeeze following rumors of buyouts. For those seeking semiconductor exposure, there are many more positive stories, a list that obviously includes beloved AI-favorite Nvidia NVDA. Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook shifting higher across the board following unbelievable quarterly results. And concerning the top line, Nvidia’s sales are forecasted to more than double in its current fiscal year.

Title: Here is what analysts had to say after AMD's AI event

Investing.com -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) announced on Thursday that it will begin mass production of its new MI325X AI chip in Q4, as it looks to expand its footprint in a market dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). At an event in San Francisco, CEO Lisa Su said AMD's next-generation MI350 chips will launch in the second half of 2025, offering more memory and a new architecture designed to significantly boost performance compared to the MI300X and MI250X models. Despite the announcements aligning with previous disclosures, AMD shares dropped 4% as investors reacted to the lack of major cloud-computing customers. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares rose 1.6%, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell 1%. AMD confirmed that vendors, including Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), will start shipping the MI325X AI chip in early 2025. The chip uses the same architecture as the MI300X but introduces a new memory type to accelerate AI computations. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker aims to challenge Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture with the MI325X. In addition to the AI chips, AMD revealed new networking chips for data centers and three new laptop processors based on the Zen 5 architecture, optimized for AI tasks. The laptop chips will support Microsoft’s Copilot+ software. Su also stated that AMD will continue to rely on Taiwan’s TSMC for advanced chip manufacturing. Bernstein: “The stock sold off during and following the event in a typical sell-the-news response, perhaps understandable given some modest excitement into the day, lack of huge surprises, and MI325X performance specs that we believe were likely somewhat disappointing relative to NVIDIA’s impending Blackwell launch. While we don’t want to minimize things we didn’t really hear anything to suggest we should anticipate substantial upside to current expectations, and would rather own NVDA at this point in front of Blackwell.” Deutsche Bank: “We view the event as a successful continuation of AMD's impressive execution in delivering high-quality Data Center innovations. The increase in its Accelerator TAM from $400b in 2027 to $500b in 2028 suggests continued confidence in the strong growth and share gain opportunities in an important market.” “Overall, we continue to expect AMD's Data Center segment to be a strong growth driver in 2025 via both share gains in CPUs and the potential for a near doubling of Instinct revenue.” Bank of America: “New MI325X performance generally remains a full year behind NVDA’s latest Blackwell, with no near-term catalyst to change the dynamic. However, we highlight AMD’s multi-vector growth opportunities across data center CPUs and GPUs remain unchanged, with the current 5-7% AI accelerator share consensus outlook presenting a minimum $25bn+ opportunity by CY28E, and a bull-case scenario of 10% AI share over the long-term still on the table, given continued hardware, software stack, and networking improvements.” Truist Securities: “We see this as a product evolution rather than a revolution, which reinforced our longer-term concerns with the stock:(1) we see AMD's position in AI as likely confined vs. NVDA's (Buy) full-stack semis/hardware/software/services solutions, and (2) we expect the X86 market will slowly come under pressure from new CPU competitors. No change to our estimates or $156 PT. Hold.” Morgan Stanley: “AMD launched the new Zen 5 server architecture, the mid-life kicker for MI300, and previewed the MI350. The bull case that MI350 lands them in a leadership position is very compelling, but in the interim MI300 seems likely to drive less upside than we see elsewhere in AI.”

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares are rising in premarket trading after its results beat estimates; investors are watching wholesale inflation numbers following yesterday's CPI report; Tesla (TSLA) shares are sinking after unveiling its "Cybercab"; Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) reduces its stake in Bank of America (BAC) to below 10%; and shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are rebounding slightly after falling yesterday following an artificial intelligence (AI) event. Here's what investors need to know today. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are rising about 1.5% in premarket trading after the world's largest bank by market cap reported earnings per share (EPS) of $4.37 on revenue of $42.65 billion, above consensus estimates of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha of $3.97 and $40.85 billion, respectively. JPMorgan shares have gained more than 25% this year. After yesterday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation isn't falling as fast as some economists expected, investors will be closely watching another data point with today's 8:30 a.m. ET release of the wholesale-focused Producer Price Index (PPI). Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires projected that prices at the wholesale level will have increased by 0.1% in September from the prior month, down from a 0.2% rise in August. Tesla (TSLA) shares are dropping 6% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle maker unveiled several new products at an event yesterday, including its highly anticipated "Cybercab" robotaxi. Tesla also showed off a larger version of the autonomous vehicle called a "Robovan," as well as its Optimus humanoid robot. Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk said that the Cybercab would cost about $30,000 and be in production by 2026. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) continues to reduce its stake in Bank of America (BAC). According to a Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett sold more than 9.5 million shares of the bank's stock. The move lowers Berkshire's stake in Bank of America to less than 10%, meaning it will face fewer reporting requirements from the SEC. Shares of Bank of America are up about 2% in premarket trading. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are rebounding by about 1% in premarket trading after they fell about 4% in the prior session following an event to show off the chipmaker's next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. At the event, AMD unveiled its fifth-generation EPYC server processor, as well as its Instinct MI300X series Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chip and other technology. The lineup initially failed to excite investors who are eager to see the company take on Nvidia (NVDA).

Title: AMD Price Levels to Watch as Stock Tumbles After AI Chip Unveiling

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 4% on Thursday as the chipmaker's new AI lineup failed to excite investors who are eager to see the company take on Nvidia (NVDA). AMD's next-generation products, unveiled at its Advancing AI event today, come as demand for AI chips soars and AMD aims to expand its market share. Analysts said investors may have been looking for clearer signs of competition with AI investor darling Nvidia, an outlook boost, or a new customer announcement. AMD shares have gained 11% year-to-date (YTD) through Thursday’s close, trailing the S&P 500’s return by about half over the same period. The stock has lagged amid concerns that the chipmaker has failed to capitalize on the lucrative AI infrastructure boom. Below, we break down the technicals on AMD’s chart and identify important price levels investors should watch out for. Since a bearish engulfing pattern marked AMD’s all-time high (ATH) in early March, the chipmaker’s share price as oscillated within an orderly descending channel, a chart pattern consisting of parallel downward sloping trendlines indicating lower highs and lower lows. More recently, the stock has run into selling pressure around the channel’s upper trendline, with Thursday’s drop occurring on the heaviest trading volume since the early August sell-off, pointing to conviction behind the move lower. It’s also worth noting that although the stock remains above the 200-day moving average (MA), the indicator crossed above the 50-day MA in August to form a death cross—a chart signal predicting lower prices. Let’s take a look at three key lower price levels that could come into play if the chipmaker’s stock continues to undergo a retracement, and also use the chart to forecast an upside price target. The first area to eye sits around $162, not far below Thursday's closing price of $164.18. This is a location where the shares could attract buying interest near the 200-day MA and a trendline connecting a range of similar trading levels on the chart between February and October. If bulls fail to hold this level, the stock could fall to the $142 area, where it may find support from a horizontal line linking a period of consolidation in December last year with the prominent May trough. A deeper correction could see the shares revisit lower support around $122, a location on the chart where investors could look for buying opportunities near the channel’s lower trendline, which closely aligns with the early-August low and late-November 2023 peak. To forecast an upside price target above the descending channel, we can use the measuring principle. This chart technique works by calculating the distance between the pattern’s two trendlines and projecting that amount from the channel’s top trendline. In other words, we add $50 to $170, which forecasts an upside target of $220, slightly below the stock’s record high of $227.30.

Title: Nvidia, Mag 7 Flash Warning Signs For Stocks

The Fed surprised the market with an aggressive 50 bps cut recently, which has pushed the S&P 500 back to new all-time highs. However, not all markets are celebrating this move. Bond yields and mortgage rates, for example, have been in an uptrend since this decision, which is not normal to see at the onset of a rate cutting cycle. Also, the bull market leaders – the Mag 7 and AI focused semiconductors – are making a series of lower highs, not confirming this move in the S&P 500. This divergence between the market leaders and the broad market has been the consistent theme of the I/O Fund’s broad market reports in 2024. More times than not, the bull market leaders will lead on the way up, as well on the way down. So, when my firm sees the primary beneficiaries of a bull market start to make lower highs while the broad market makes higher highs, it tends to be a warning. Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang, left, talks about artifical intelligence with Meta's ... [+] chief Mark Zuckerberg at SIGGRAPH 2024, the premier conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques, Monday, July 29, 2024, in the Colorado Convention Center in downtown Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) In this report, my team will address the risks brewing in the market. The strange behavior in the bond market could be signaling that the FOMC has made a policy error. This coupled with key tech stocks trending lower against the S&P 500’s advance, has my firm cautious for the time being. In 2023 we saw these market leaders trending higher with the broad market. This was a powerful trend that lasted into late 2023. As a result, the collective Mag 7 returned around 90% in 2023 vs. the S&P 500 returning 24%. However, this trend is not continuing into 2024, as we are beginning to see cracks in market leadership. This year, the Mag 7 are up ~30% compared to the S&P 500’s ~20%. Though this year has been excellent for investors, it’s concerning the relative strength between the bull market leaders and the broad market is narrowing, which has been a constant theme in our broad market analysis throughout all of 2024. “When the cycle leaders start to underperform, it tends to mark the start of a trend change. The FAANGs have been the undoubted leaders of this bull run, and we are now seeing them start to trend lower against the indexes. More times than not, the leaders on the way up, tend to be the leaders on the way down.” More importantly, the Mag 7 is making a lower high, while the S&P 500 makes a higher high. In other words, the bull market leaders are not confirming this push higher in the broad market. This is a rare pattern that has only shown up one other time in this bull market – July of 2023, just before we saw an almost 11% correction in the broad market. A rare pattern observed in the bull market, similar to July 2023, preceding an 11% correction in the ... [+] broad market. This divergence is not only happening with the Mag 7, but it’s also happening with the most important sub-sector within tech due to AI – semiconductors. Since the current bull market began on October 13th of 2022, the Mag 7 has returned over 102% vs. the S&P 500’s 61%. During the same period, semiconductors have returned over 174%. The leading stock, Nvidia, is up over 967% over the same period. So, while the Mag 7 are the popular market leaders, the true market leaders of the current bull cycle are semiconductors, and specifically, Nvidia. This is a trend that the I/O Fund positioned for in 2022, making NVDA our largest position, as we rotated out of cloud stocks and into AI. Performance of the Mag 7, S&P 500, and semiconductors since October 13, 2022: The Mag 7 returned ... [+] over 102%, the S&P 500 returned 61%, and semiconductors returned over 174%, with Nvidia up over 967%. SMH has a history of leading market swings in the broad market. Since 2021, every time the S&P 500 made a new high without SMH, it preceded a period of volatility. Today’s divergence is one of the largest on record. The Semiconductor Index topped in July at $283, and is still well below this high, compared to the S&P 500 that just pushed to new a new high this week at 5796. Chart illustrating the semiconductor sub-sector’s corrective pattern, featuring a 3-wave drop since ... [+] June followed by a bounce from the August 5th low, suggesting a potential final drop targeting $190 to $165. When digging deeper into this key sub-sector, we can see that a clear corrective pattern is playing out. Since the June top, there is a clear 3 waves down. This has been followed, so far, by a symmetrical 3 wave bounce off the August 5th low. This pattern best fits a standard corrective patten. This implies that a final drop is still needed, which is targeting between $190 - $165. The advance seen today is poking above the downtrend line from the July top. However, this is happening on less volume and less momentum. Note the momentum indicator below the chart. It has given three lower highs while price provided three higher highs. This is a rare pattern that tends to precede a trend reversal. Chart depicting the current market advance above the July downtrend line, showing decreasing volume ... [+] and momentum. The momentum indicator reveals three lower highs, while the price shows three higher highs, suggesting a potential trend reversal. Nvidia topped in June at $140, and failed to make a new high in July with the rest of the Semiconductor Index. This was a warning that semis, and the broad market, were heading lower. This same relative weakness is still present today. While most semiconductors have broken out above their August high, NVDA remained below it. This week, it has moved above the August high, which appears to be the final move in this bounce which is happening on less momentum and less volume. This lines up with the I/O Fund’s game plan, which was to sell a quarter of our NVDA position in June around $129, and attempt to buy it lower in the coming months, which was discussed in detail on my recent interview. Chart illustrating NVDA’s incomplete corrective pattern, indicating potential drops below $114 and ... [+] $108, which could lead to a decline toward the $90 - $70 region, completing a multi-month correction. Like SMH, NVDA appears to be tracing an incomplete corrective pattern. A move below $114 and then $108 will signal that the stock is heading toward the $90 - $70 region, which would complete this multi-month correction. NVDA remains weaker than the broad market, as well as SMH. Considering the importance of this stock, as long as it remains below its June high, it is a warning to the current broad market advance. Some have argued that the market is taking gains in the AI leaders and spreading that money out into beaten down sectors. In other words, there is a healthy broadening out of the market, which typically exhibits strength. The narrative that supports this idea is that the FOMC just offered a surprise 50 bps rate cut into a seemingly healthy economy. The cheaper cost of borrowing should propel more economically sensitive sectors to play catch-up as the economic expansion continues. As plausible as this sounds, it’s just not showing up in data, yet. Since the Fed cut rates on September 18th, we are not seeing money flowing into your beaten down sectors that should do well if this narrative is playing out. Sectors like, transportation, small caps, retail sales, consumer discretionary and high beta are still under their 2021 highs. These are the sectors that would benefit from a soft-landing. As you can see below, aside from consumer discretionary, they are all underperforming the S&P 500. Chart illustrating the market dynamics where AI leaders are gaining, but beaten down sectors like ... [+] transportation, small caps, retail sales, consumer discretionary, and high beta are still lagging behind the S&P 500, showing no significant investment flow after the FOMC’s 50 bps rate cut. While Nvidia and Semiconductors are making a lower high, there is more money flowing into defensive and inflationary markets, like, Energy, Apple, Utilities and even the US dollar is doing better than the markets that would support the broadening out narrative. Another unusual development since the Fed cut rates is that bonds are not acting as they should at the onset of a rate cutting cycle. Historically, the relationship between long-dated bonds and the Fed cutting rates has been an inverse relationship. As the Fed cuts rates, it is usually in the face of a weakening economy. If prices are going down due to demand collapsing, then a fixed yield is desirable in that environment, meaning that we should see bonds going higher. This is not what is happening today. The day the Fed cut rates, the 10-year government bond began a sharp decline and is currently down nearly 4% from its high. This is a big move for the 10-year bond. Chart showing the 10-year government bond’s sharp decline after the Fed’s rate cut, highlighting an ... [+] unusual trend where bond prices typically rise in a weakening economy. The bond is down nearly 4% from its high. This is unusual behavior, as the above chart shows. Bonds should be going higher, not lower, based on historical comparisons. The popular narrative for this behavior in the bond market is that this is evidence that the FED accomplished a soft landing. If we were going into a slowing economy, which could lead to a deflationary event, then bonds would be catching a bid. So, the fact that we are not must mean that the economy is strong, and the economic expansion will only continue. This will then propel asset prices higher, as well as inflation, making the need for fixed yields a poor investment. As we just saw, the market is not buying this narrative, as money is not flowing into the sectors that would support this thesis. So, what could be going on? It’s important to understand that the Fed does not control the 10-year yield; this is controlled by the bond market’s expectations for future growth and inflation. The Fed’s reasoning for aggressively dropping rates on September 18th was that inflation is heading to 2% and the employment market is starting to show weakness. Since then, the ISM non-manufacturing PMI posted its hottest reading since February of 2023. Twelve out of the 18 segments of this report stated that prices are rising, not falling. Chart highlighting the ISM non-manufacturing PMI’s highest reading since February 2023, with 12 of ... [+] 18 segments reporting rising prices. Additionally, the labor market added 107,000 more jobs than expected, revising September figures up by 17,000, causing the unemployment rate to drop from 4.22% to 4.05%. This was accompanied with a labor market that is much stronger than expected. The most recent jobs report showed that the US added 107,000 more jobs than expected, while September’s report was revised higher by 17,000 jobs. This caused the unemployment rate to drop back to 4.05% from 4.22%. This is further confirmed with current mortgage rates. Everyone was expecting mortgage rates to drop with the Fed Funds Rate. However, since the cut, there has been a sharp increase in average mortgage rate from 6% to 6.32%. Current mortgage rates defy expectations, rising sharply from 6% to 6.32% following the Fed’s rate ... [+] cut, contrary to the anticipated decrease. The reason for this is because mortgage rates are not determined by the Fed. Instead, they are the result of an equation that includes the 10-year yield and the borrower’s credit score. So, the 10-year getting sold, means yields are going up. This happening on the day of the FED’s rate cut policy means the bond market is not convinced inflation is heading to 2%, which is pushing mortgage rates higher. This means that we could be getting signals that the FED made a policy error, and dropped rates too soon, as yields continue to climb in the weeks after this decision. Interesting enough, at the Grant’s Annual Fall Conference, Druckenmiller stated that his largest bet is shorting the US bond market. His reasoning is not because the Fed achieved a successful soft landing, which the consensus believes, but it is because “bipartisan fiscal recklessness is on the horizon.” In other words, the larger our deficits become, the more money will need to be borrowed to cover interest payments. As more and more debt gets created, yields will have to go up to attract more buyers, which will put pressure on fiscal budgets, and therefore creates a vicious cycle. To put this into perspective, the budget deficit for the fiscal year 2024 is going to come in around $1.9 Trillion, or 6.7% of GDP. There is no other year in US history where the budget deficient was this large outside of a major war, like WW I & WW II, or dealing with a major recession, like 2008. It is unheard of to have fiscal spending this high, in an expanding economy, with historically low unemployment. This makes you wonder what the deficit will look like in the face of a contraction. This was an issue that the market has been aware of for decades but was able to ignore due to historically low interest rates. With rates low and trending lower, this fiscal recklessness was allowed to go on. However, we are seeing for the first time in 30 years, bond yields are starting a new uptrend. Since 1981, the 10-year yield has been in a classic downtrend, making a series of lower highs. This trend made borrowing easier, as low rates made the cost of borrowing affordable. However, in 2021, yields broke this downtrend and made their first higher highs in 30 years. Today, yields are higher than they were in 2008, making the cost of borrowing higher than most investors are used to in over 20 years. Diagram illustrating the market’s awareness of excessive debt and low interest rates enabling fiscal ... [+] recklessness. Since 1981, the 10-year yield has followed a downtrend until breaking the trend in 2021, resulting in the highest borrowing costs seen in over 20 years. If this uptrend in yields continues, which looks likely, it would become problematic for inflation expectations, as well as the Fed’s ability to lower rates. It will also become problematic for the cost to service government debts, as more debt will be issued at higher rates to cover current service requirements. And, it will become problematic for stocks, specifically high beta stocks that need to borrow to fund operations, as estimates on future cash flows will have to account for a higher cost to borrow. In short, the last +20 years have built on the idea that inflation will not happen, and the FED can keep rates close to zero. The bull market pattern off the 2022 low has taken the shape of a messy diagonal pattern. This is a 5 wave pattern where the internal waves are 3 waves in all directions. It is also marked with large, overlapping swings. Note how wave 4 went into wave 1 territory – this is typical of diagonals. The 5th wave in this pattern is a blow off, and from what I can tell, we are in the final swing of this pattern. If SPX can breakout above 5825, then it can likely push into the 6000 – 6185 region. If instead, it breaks down below 5675 this will be your first indication of a potential trend change. Below 5500 and then 5115 will be the final confirmations. Chart illustrating a messy diagonal pattern in the bull market since the 2022 low, consisting of 5 ... [+] waves with overlapping swings. Key breakout points are at 5825, while downtrend confirmations are at 5675 and 5500, indicating potential trend changes. In conclusion, as the economic expansion continues, the odds of a recession remain low. However, money is not flowing into the beaten down sectors that would benefit from this reality. Instead, defensive and inflationary names are getting more flows than transportation, small caps, high beta and retail sales. The market leaders continue to make lower highs while the broad market pushes higher, and bonds are getting sold as if the FED stopped cutting rates, not started. The warning signs are high, and my firm remains defensive until these signals reverse, or the market corrects.

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground after the latest Consumer Price Index report showed greater-than-expected price increases in September, driven by an uptick in grocery prices. In addition to weighing on household budgets, the hot inflation data could constrain the Federal Reserve as policymakers deliberate over further interest-rate cuts. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% on Thursday, while the Dow was down 0.1%. Both indexes receded from record closes posted in the previous session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also retreated, though it fared slightly better, closing with a minimal daily loss of less than 0.1%. Shares of solar panel producer First Solar (FSLR) plunged 9.3%, the most of any S&P 500 constituent, after Jefferies reduced its price target on the stock to $266 from $271. Research analysts warned of potential delays that could restrain First Solar's volumes in the current quarter and those to come. Other solar industry stocks also moved lower: Shares of solar technology firm Enphase Energy (ENPH) slipped 5.8%. Semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) unveiled new artificial intelligence (AI) chips at its "Advancing AI 2024" event in San Francisco on Thursday. Its shares dropped 4%, with some analysts suggesting that its presentation may not have been sufficient to convince investors that its new products will be able to compete with AI chips from Nvidia (NVDA). Shares of Generac Holdings (GNRC), which provides home generators and other power solutions, fell 3.5% as Hurricane Milton moved through Florida. Thursday's downturn reversed a portion of the gains posted by the stock ahead of the storm. The day's strongest performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), which climbed 5.6% after RBC Capital included the stock on its list of top picks in the software space. Analysts believe the company is successfully moving past an incident in July when a faulty software update caused widespread IT outages around the world. Shares of fertilizer maker Mosaic Co. (MOS) gained 4.4%. Based in Tampa, Fla., Mosaic faced uncertainties about the potential impact of Hurricane Milton on its operations. The company said Thursday that it will begin to assess the impact of the storm as soon as conditions allow. Shares of Micron Technology (MU) shares added 3.9%. Although AMD's AI event may have failed to generate much investor enthusiasm, its new chips included more memory than previous products, underlining the importance of high-bandwidth memory for AI processes. Micron, which manufactures memory chips, is a partner of AMD.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced new artificial intelligence chips to boost its rivalry with other chipmakers, including Nvidia (NVDA). The chipmaker launched its new Instinct MI325X accelerators and Ryzen AI PRO 300 series processors along with other leading-edge computing chips on Thursday at its Advancing AI conference in San Francisco. “The data center and AI represent significant growth opportunities for AMD, and we are building strong momentum for our EPYC and AMD Instinct processors across a growing set of customers,” AMD chief executive Lisa Su said in a statement. With its new chips, AMD is “delivering leadership compute to power our customers’ most important and demanding workloads,” she added. By 2028, AMD sees the market for data center AI accelerators reaching $500 billion, Su said, adding that the chipmaker is “committed to delivering open innovation at scale through our expanded silicon, software, network and cluster-level solutions.” At Computex in June, Su announced AMD’s next-generation MI325X AI accelerator with improved “performance and memory capabilities for the most demanding AI” processing, which she said would be available in the fourth quarter. She also unveiled the Ryzen AI PRO 300 series which will be used for AI laptops, including Microsoft’s (MSFT) Copilot+ PCs. Like rival Nvidia, Su said in June that AMD has “expanded our roadmap so it’s now on an annual cadence, that means a new product family every year.” AMD expects to launch its next-generation Instinct MI350 series accelerators in the second half of 2025, the chipmaker said. Its Instinct MI400 Series accelerators are planned for 2026. The company’s Instinct MI300X accelerators were launched in December, and are used by some of the world’s leading AI models from OpenAI, Meta (META), and open-source models on Hugging Face.

Title: PC shipments fall in Q3 despite AI push by Microsoft, chipmakers
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-shipments-fall-in-q3-despite-ai-push-by-microsoft-chipmakers-151502305.html

The global PC industry hit a snag in the third quarter, as worldwide shipments declined for the first time in three quarters — despite hype around so-called artificial intelligence PCs and growth in the US and Japan. According to Gartner, third quarter PC shipments, or devices sent out to retailers for sale, fell 1.3% year over year to 62.9 million units from 63.8 million units in the same period in 2023. Shipments dropped the most in China, with Gartner reporting a 10% collapse in demand in the country as government and state-affiliated entities sought out fewer desktops. Shipments in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa took a less dramatic hit than China, dropping 1.5% due to a flurry of events that Gartner says distracted consumers, including elections in the UK and France and sporting events like the Olympics. The US, meanwhile, saw a 5.6% increase in shipments, while Japan saw double-digit growth in the quarter. Still, the PC industry is in the midst of a broader comeback after years of declines and the massive amount of growth it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. At the time, consumers and enterprises bought up virtually as many PCs as they could get their hands on to ensure they had the means to work and stay entertained while stuck in their homes for months on end. But that boom meant people who might have been holding off on buying PCs ended up purchasing them sooner than they otherwise would have, pulling future sales forward. With so many customers outfitted with new PCs, demand crumbled, leading to an extended slump that lasted roughly two years, including the worst decline in 17 years in 2023. The slump hit companies ranging from PC manufacturers for Microsoft (MSFT) to chipmakers Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA). In Q2 2023, as sales struggled, Microsoft reported that its Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% year over year. Intel and AMD saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter 2023 Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million. The shipment declines come as the PC industry is pushing the concept of AI PCs, or computers outfitted with neural processing units (NPUs) or high-powered graphics cards that can run AI applications locally rather than via the cloud. Microsoft is pushing its own version of AI PCs it refers to as Copilot+ PCs, which meet certain hardware requirements such as powerful NPUs. But the marketing doesn’t seem to be paying off. According to Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa, AI PCs “did not boost the demand for PCs since buyers have yet to see their clear benefits or business value.” What’s more, she said, the end of Windows 10 support in 2025 didn’t drive updates in areas like China. There’s still plenty of debate about whether AI will become a huge selling point for consumer electronics, whether that’s PCs or smartphones. So far, Microsoft has shown off a number of potentially useful AI features for Windows 11, including its Click to Do option that provides you with a context-sensitive set of options to take action on what you’re viewing on your screen. Microsoft says you can do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing, allowing the search engine to search for content based on images rather than words. But it’s not clear yet if AI is a major selling point for consumers. Jefferies recently downgraded Apple’s stock saying that expectations for AI-powered iPhones are overblown. And if that holds true, you can bet it’ll be the same for PCs. Regardless of the declines in Q3 or whether AI proves to be the kind of catalyst the industry needs, Kitagawa says PC shipments should improve for the year as a whole and blow up in 2025. “At the worldwide level, PC demand will see more uptake toward the end of 2024 and more robust growth in 2025, when the PC refresh will be at its peak,” said Kitagawa.

Title: Morgan Stanley Details What Caused NVIDIA’s Blackwell Hiccup, Asserts That The Blackwell Production Ramp-Up Appears “Quite Strong”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Given the quantum of fund inflows into AI-related investment themes, Wall Street appears laser-focused on NVIDIA's Blackwell production ramp-up as a guarantor of sorts for the secular AI tailwind. Today, Morgan Stanley has penned yet another note on NVIDIA's latest GPU architecture, this time choosing to divulge some additional information regarding what exactly caused a production bottleneck over the summer. As we've noted in previous posts, NVIDIA had confirmed the rumors of a minor Blackwell design flaw during its recent earnings call, but assured investors that the resulting low-yields issue was rectified by implementing a few minor changes to the photomask - a specific template that is used to create bespoke patterns on semiconductor wafers. NVIDIA $NVDA Blackwell ramp appears "quite strong" and issues with initial Blackwell silicon are "totally behind us", says Morgan Stanley, reiterating at 'Overweight' with a $150 price-target: "In the shorter term, the Blackwell ramp appears to be quite strong, with no major… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 10, 2024 Now, Morgan Stanley is out with its own take on the Blackwell production hiccup, noting that the low-yields issue was only discovered in the post-packaging stage. The ensuing scrapping of the subpar units resulted in a loss of "CoWoS and HBM3e," which were already in short supply and only aggravated NVIDIA's supply problems. Morgan Stanley goes on to note: "But those issues are behind the company and there is high conviction in prior guidance that they will have several billion in Blackwell revenue in the January quarter." Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley has reiterated that it now sees a "quite strong" Blackwell production ramp-up, "with no major changes to the roadmaps and every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility, in line with all of our checks." In a critical insight, Morgan Stanley notes: "Any new Blackwell orders now that aren't already in queue will be shipped late next year, as they are booked out 12 months or so, which continues to drive strong short term demand for Hopper which will still be a major factor though the year." Of course, the Wall Street titan has already stated that it sees NVIDIA shipping up to 450,000 units of the Blackwell GPUs in the December-ending quarter, resulting in between $5 billion and $10 billion in revenue. Moreover, Morgan Stanley believes that NVIDIA will produce between 700,000 and 800,000 units of Blackwell GPUs in Q1'25, which corresponds to a 3x sequential increase in volumes. At the same time, the bank sees Hopper volumes at 1.5 million units in Q4'24, and at around 1 million units in Q1'25.

Title: Macro Guru Hugh Hendry Betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and Lower Interest Rates for 2025 – Here’s Why

Hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry is betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and low interest rates next year. Hendry says there “always two ever-present tail risks” in a short volatility investment strategy, which aims to profit off decreases in market volatility by selling options. “Do you buy the call option that the Mag-7 become capitalized at 100% of GDP or that rates descend rapidly to the lower bound? That’s why I keep hammering on about observing where stock levels are on the day of the next cut. I’m running a barbell: long BTC and long calls on <2% Fed Funds at year end 2025 I am of course exposed to a tracking error, that stocks surge and bitcoin is flat or down on some idiosyncratic news. I’m content to run that risk.” Mag-7 refers to the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL; GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). Hendry also compares Bitcoin’s size to the Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the Nasdaq-100 Index. “BTC is everyone’s phantom, good or bad. In reality, its MASS renders it irrelevant to this conversation but highly attractive for upside consideration. In the game of Newton’s Cradle, MASS is paramount today, it’s the outlier. BTC’s capitalization is just $1 trillion. QQQ is $42 trillion. The Qs, or rather the $13 trillion in the Mag-7, are therefore the only consideration. Bank stock lending renders the robustness of that valuation paramount. If that melts, the credit unravels, the margin call is immense. Perhaps doesn’t happen, but if I were a bank I’d be circumspect about the moneyness of that collateral. I’d be trying to contra-cyclically reduce my assets, markets and their liquidity permitting. By moneyness I mean the pledged assets’ proximity to a t-bill. Your t-bill ain’t gonna lose 83% of its value over the next 18 months. Bur stocks capitalized at these vaunted levels vis-a-vis GDP have periodically suffered such reversals.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: GOOGL vs. META: Which AI/Big Data Stock Is Better?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/googl-vs-meta-ai-big-064609819.html
Time Published: 2024-10-10T06:46:09Z

In this piece, I evaluated two AI/Big Data stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META). A closer look suggests bullish ratings for both, although a clear winner emerges. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, generates revenue from online advertising, sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, and fees on cloud services and other licensing revenue. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, also generates revenue from online advertising. Shares of Alphabet have tumbled 12% over the last three months, bringing their year-to-date gain to 20%, which accounts for nearly all of the 21% one-year return. In contrast, Meta Platforms stock is up 12% over the last three months for a year-to-date jump of 69% and a one-year bounce of 88%. The two companies’ equally opposite three-month performances create a setup for an interesting matchup, as outlined below. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.5x, there’s no ignoring the fact that Alphabet is cheap. While concerns about generative AI could threaten the technology giant, the current P/E is just too cheap to ignore, suggesting a bullish view is in order. Notably, advertising still accounts for the lion’s share of Alphabet’s quarterly revenue, including $64.6 billion of the $84.7 billion in total revenue. Google Search alone accounted for $48.5 billion of total revenue. Thus, it’s easy to see why some might give credence to the concerns raised by a fund manager last week. However, I would suggest that his view might be a bit short-sighted, especially since Search revenue is still growing. At the 2024 Quality-Growth Conference last week, Stephen Yiu of Blue Whale Capital explained why he’s bearish on Alphabet right now. He expects generative AI to significantly change Alphabet’s business model, although he does see some upside left in the near term. Nonetheless, he maintains a negative view due to signs of a market share decline from Google Search, which once held a 90% share. Furthermore, Alphabet’s AI model, Gemini, has yet to meet the expectations set by competing models. Despite Yiu’s longer-term concerns for Alphabet, this looks like a buy-the-dip opportunity. On a P/E basis, the shares have been range-bound since about April 2023. However, they’re currently at the bottom of the valuation range, suggesting another leg up could be in the offing soon. Even if Alphabet does enter a period of struggle, as Yiu maintains, this company isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. In short, Alphabet is one of those stocks that’s good to buy and hold for the long term, although the size of the position in your portfolio might fluctuate based on valuation. Thus, I would recommend a small position right now if you don’t already have one, potentially with plans to add a few more shares if you already have a position. After all, Alphabet has more than doubled over the past five years, rising 174%. Additionally, should Gemini deliver positive surprises, Alphabet shares will rise further, potentially breaking out of their current range. We’re already starting to see signs of this with the integration into Google Search and the recent Gemini at Work event, which covered a range of AI use cases for enterprises. Alphabet has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, nine Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $200.29, the average Alphabet stock price target implies upside potential of 21.85%. See more GOOGL analyst ratings At a P/E of 30x, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s on the rise after hitting bottom at around 25.5x in early August. Meta has been rangebound for about a year or so on a P/E basis and is approaching the middle of that range. Nonetheless, a long-term bullish view looks appropriate. Meta Platforms is less diversified than Alphabet, capturing 98% of its revenue from advertising in the second quarter. This could prevent a problem in the event that digital advertising goes south, though that looks doubtful. Yiu also commented on Meta Platforms, picking it as his top Magnificent Seven stock aside from NVIDIA (NVDA). He believes that Meta has greater access to personal information than Alphabet, thanks to the interactions occurring across its various platforms. He noted that this provides more personal information about individuals than just searching for things on Google. Further, Yiu mentioned that he believes ads on Meta Platforms will become more personalized through generative AI, which he expects to have a greater impact on Meta than on Alphabet. He argues that personal interactions are more likely to drive immediate purchase decisions compared to Google searches. Additionally, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg supported Yiu’s remarks, stating that AI will allow Meta to offer even more tailored advertisements. I would agree with Yiu on these points, but I don’t think Meta will enjoy greater benefits from AI than Alphabet, especially over the long term. Notably, Meta’s ad revenue growth rate reached 22% in the second quarter, double that of Google’s growth rate. However, it’s important to consider that Alphabet’s growth rate was based on a much larger scale versus Meta’s total revenue of $39.1 billion for Q2. Meta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $607.92, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies downside potential of 2.54%. See more META analyst ratings Although both Alphabet and Meta Platforms receive bullish ratings, Alphabet is the clear winner here. Google Cloud revenues continued to rise sequentially, surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the second quarter. The Cloud division accounts for Alphabet’s AI revenue, which is critical because AI is already starting to cover for the drop in ad revenue. On the other hand, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s verging on overbought territory with a Relative Strength Index of 69.4. Ultimately, I expect Alphabet and Meta to both capture significant AI revenues. However, Alphabet takes the crown this time around due to valuation and the fact that it was able to put an actual number on AI-related revenue, while Meta just talked about AI making a difference in its revenue growth.

Astera Labs (ALAB) shares jumped Wednesday after the Nvidia (NVDA) supplier announced new products to support artificial intelligence (AI). The company introduced two new fabric switches that Nvidia Senior VP of GPU Engineering Brian Kelleher said will support the chipmaker's AI infrastructure "across a wide variety of AI and [high-performance computing] workloads." Astera, which went public in March, said in its initial public offering (IPO) filing that its customers include several key players in the AI space such as Nvidia, as well as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Jefferies analysts said the new products could help Astera diversify its offerings and expand the market for its products. The analysts held a "buy" rating for the stock, with a price target of $65, about 6% above Wednesday's closing price of $61.22. Astera Labs shares surged over 15% Wednesday, and have gained about 70% from their IPO price in March.

Following a brief but dramatic dip in late August and early September, Nvidia has rebounded sharply. The stock closed down slightly on Wednesday at $132.65, just shy of its closing high of $135.58 reached in June. Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft as the second-most valuable company, behind only Apple. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom, as companies including Meta, OpenAI, Alphabet, Microsoft and Oracle continue to unveil technologies and products that require hefty investments in its graphics processing units, or GPUs. In August, Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that showed revenue rose 122% year over year while net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion. The company also gave stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter and said it expects to ship several billion dollars worth of its new Blackwell AI chip. Demand is so high that Nvidia anticipates shipments for its current-generation Hopper chip to increase over the next two quarters. "We see NVDA remaining the leader in the AI training and inference chips for Data Center applications," Mizuho analysts said in a note Wednesday, estimating that the company has about 95% market share. The analysts have a $140 price target on the stock but noted risks in potentially escalating export restrictions to China, geopolitical tensions regarding Taiwan or a significant pullback in AI server spending. "Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first," CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview last week on CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime," speaking of the "insane" demand for the Blackwell chip. Production for the GPU, which will cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. The stock rallied for other reasons over the last month, too. Nvidia shares jumped 4% on Sept. 23, after a filing showed Huang finished selling the company's stock. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips have been a driver of the current artificial intelligence boom — and the chipmaker only wants to make it move faster, chief executive Jensen Huang said. During an appearance on the Tech Unheard podcast, Huang was asked by host Rene Haas, chief executive of British semiconductor company Arm (ARM), if the pace of AI innovation is moving “faster than you imagined.” Huang replied, “No,” and said Nvidia is “trying to make it go faster.” “We’ve gone to a one-year cycle,” Huang said about the company’s production of new chips. “And the reason for that is because the technology has the opportunity to move fast.” Nvidia is designing “six or seven new chips per system,” Huang said, then using “co-design to reinvent the entire system” and inventing other technologies that allow it to improve performance by two or three times while using the same amount of energy and cost each year. “That’s another way of, essentially, reducing the cost of AI by two or three times per year,” Huang said. “That is way faster than Moore’s Law.” Over the next few years, Huang said, Nvidia wants to drive down the cost of AI amid the rise of even more complex models. This evolution is already underway. In September, OpenAI released a new series of “reasoning” AI models called o1, which are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond,” the way humans do. In the future, AI services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which Huang said he uses every day, will “iteratively reason about the answer” and could go through hundreds or thousands of inferences before producing an output. This level of complex processing would require significantly more computational power than current models. Despite the increased demands, Huang believes the trade-off is worthwhile. “[T]he quality of the answer is so much better,” Huang said. “We want to drive the cost down so that we could deliver this new type of reasoning inference with the same level of cost and responsiveness as the past.” On Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock was climbing back toward its record high $135 close in June. The chipmaker’s shares were down 0.27% during midday trading, but opened up almost 1% at around $134 per share.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock is aiming for a new all-time high close as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom. The stock traded flat midday Wednesday at $133. It previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. Nvidia stock notched its fifth consecutive day of gains Tuesday, rising 4% to $132.89. Shares are up 12% from last week. The stock’s climb has been fueled by a barrage of good news for the company. Wall Street analysts this week have reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday. Nvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Nvidia’s weeklong ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second-quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China, due to rising trade tensions with the US, had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June. Other positive news in the semiconductor sector Wednesday could help Nvidia stock achieve a new record close. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term. “AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.” The chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown. Semiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that it’s boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs (graphics processing units). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

AI behemoth NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is breaking out and could be heading to its June high of around $141 per share, according to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies. "Heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) confirmed a triangle breakout yesterday, supporting near-term follow-through toward its June high (~$141)," Stockton said. "While the SPX and NDX have seen short-term momentum weaken, NVDA’s breakout is likely to prevent a major pullback in the major indices, which is part of the reason why we keep a short-term neutral bias for U.S. equities in today's Fairlead Tactics." NVIDIA stock has been up six straight sessions, including today's fractional gain of 0.12%. The stock is up more than 170% year-to-date. Analysts have been increasingly bullish on the company's Blackwell product, which the CEO Jensen Huang said is seeing "insane" demand. "Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and demand for Blackwell is insane," Huang said on CNBC's last week. "Everyone wants the most, and everyone wants to be first." Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) reported that September sales beat estimates on solid AI chip demand. TSM said revenue for September 2024 was approximately NT$251.87 billion, an increase of 0.4 percent from August 2024 and an increase of 39.6 percent from September 2023. TSM makes NVIDIA's AI chip. On Tuesday, analysts at Morgan Stanley said Blackwell production revenue in 1Q25 may surpass Hopper. Blackwell chips command a price premium, with B200 chips priced 60-70% higher than H200, positioning Blackwell revenue to overtake Hopper in the upcoming quarter.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are nearing their all-time highs Wednesday morning on positive news about the chipmaker's artificial intelligence (AI) products. Nvidia shares, which have ended higher the past five sessions, recently edged up to $133.30. Their all-time closing high is $135.58, achieved on June 18, and record intraday high is $140.76, recorded the following session two days later, after markets were closed for Juneteenth. On Tuesday, contract electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn reported strong demand for its servers powered by Nvidia's GB200 semiconductors, part of the latter's Blackwell architecture. Microsoft announced it was "the 1st cloud" running the Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers. OpenAI also thanked Nvidia for delivering "one of the first engineering builds of the DGX B200 to our office." Also yesterday, Nvidia noted that the Blackwell platform has slashed energy consumption by up to 2,000 times over the last decade for AI training models such as OpenAI's GPT-4. Bob Pette, vice president and general manager of Nvidia's enterprise platforms, told participants at the company's AI Summit that "We are in the dawn of a new industrial revolution," adding that the firm is "designing our systems with not just performance in mind, but with energy efficiency in mind." Nvidia shares have soared about 170% this year. TradingView

September sales rose at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), with the chipmaker on Wednesday reporting numbers that pointed toward better-than-expected third-quarter revenue. The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported September sales of 251.87 billion New Taiwan dollars ($7.82 billion), up just under 40% from the same time last year. Added to its results for August and July, TSMC reported NT$759.69 billion ($23.58 billion) in revenue for the third quarter, above the NT$749.88 billion analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had expected and roughly 36% above sales for the third quarter of 2023. The results surpassed TSMC's own outlook, as the company said in its second-quarter earnings report that it expected third-quarter revenue between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. The company's US-traded shares were recently down more than 1% as broader markets wavered. The stock has risen steadily from August lows and is near record levels, up roughly 75% this year. The PHLX index of semiconductor shares edged lower Thursday. TSMC is set to report the rest of its third-quarter financial results on the morning of Oct. 17. The company surpassed estimates in the first two quarters of 2024, as demand for its chips to power AI technology have remained in high demand.

Nvidia stock seems to be climbing back to its record high close from June. The AI chipmaker’s stock was up almost 1% at the open on Wednesday, to about $134 per share. It later fell to about $133 per share. Nvidia (NVDA) shares closed at almost $133 the day before. Nvidia’s rising stock has pushed its market capitalization past Microsoft’s (MSFT) again. During Wednesday morning trading, the chipmaker’s market cap reached $3.26 trillion, while Microsoft’s was $3.09 trillion. Both trailed Apple’s (AAPL) market cap of $3.44 trillion. In June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite falling back down, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings. In June, Nvidia’s shares closed at a record high $135.58, days after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. Since then, its shares have experienced some turbulence, but the company’s stock is still up 173.4% so far this year. Compared to a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up 192%. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which supplies Nvidia and Apple with chips, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue of NT$759.7 billion, or $23.6 billion, for the September quarter, according to Reuters. Compared to a year ago, TSMC’s revenue grew 36.5%, Reuters calculated. In July, the chipmaker said it expects third-quarter revenue to be between $22.4 billion and 23.2 billion.

Talk about an undecided market. As of the close on Monday, October 7, in four of the past five days, the closing range of the S&P 500 (SPX) was 13.6 points. That is two-tenths of 1% based on the price of the index. For the Nasdaq, the range in four out of five days was 14.76 points or eight one-hundredths of 1%. The Nasdaq 100's (QQQ) range was 0.83 points or two-tenths of 1%. The Nasdaq and the QQQ tested their 21-day exponential a few times and remain perilously close to breaking that average, while the SPX has come close to the average on several occasions intraday. Third-quarter EPS season is now underway and the next three weeks will be very heavy with earnings reports. Just prior to and just after earnings reports, companies are in a blackout period. During that time, a company cannot repurchase its stock. So in April/early May, July/early August, October/early November, and January/early February, there is an absence of demand that can create weakness in the overall market. First-quarter 2024 share buybacks on the S&P 500 were $237 billion and for the 12-months ending March 2024, buybacks were $817 billion.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.
