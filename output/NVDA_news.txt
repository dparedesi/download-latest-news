Title: Nvidia and other chip stocks surge with no sign of AI spending slowdown — for now

Nvidia's (NVDA) record close on Monday comes as AI hardware stocks continue a recent tear fueled by investor enthusiasm over surging artificial intelligence demand. Nvidia shares are up 8% from last week, pushing the chipmaker closer to unseating Apple (AAPL) as Wall Street's most valuable company. The stock's rally follows recent comments from CEO Jensen Huang and the chipmaker's partners touting an intense need for the company's AI chips. Other AI chip and hardware stocks Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB), and Micron (MU) have risen, too, as the companies have given separate indications of strong demand for their products, thanks to the AI boom. TSMC (TSM) stock also closed at a record high Monday. All in all, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) is up 4.5% over the past five days, outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which rose 2.9% over the same time frame. The upward trajectory of AI chip stocks is a positive sign for AI hardware spending that assuages Wall Street’s concerns of a near-term slowdown on investment. "While Phase 2 stocks [i.e. AI infrastructure-related stocks, such as Arm, TSMC, and SMCI] appear modestly expensive relative to history, it is possible that the demand for AI leads the mega-cap tech stocks to spend even more on AI-related capex than investors and analysts currently expect," Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts wrote in their report on Oct. 10. Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) have all indicated that they will continue to spend large sums on AI infrastructure through next year, to the benefit of AI hardware companies, led by Nvidia. As a whole, mega-cap tech companies are set to spend $215 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2024 and $250 billion in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs. OpenAI’s recent $6.6 billion funding round is also expected to put cash in the hands of hardware companies — namely Nvidia — as it continues evolving its AI models. JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Harlan Sur sees revenues for the semiconductor industry growing 6% to 8% in 2024. “We remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks,” he said in a recent note to investors, “as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25.” A slowdown in investment will eventually come, though. The question is when. Whereas AI software is typically offered on a subscription basis, hardware is a one-time sale. Analysts have warned that AI chip stocks are in a bubble that will eventually burst once Big Tech’s massive spending on AI infrastructure eases. Indeed, tech giants' most recent earnings reports put on display a widening gap between their hefty spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure and their return on investment — and tested Wall Street’s thinning patience. The stocks of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all fell late this summer following their quarterly financial reports, which showed billions in AI spending. “We continue to believe that spending on data center infrastructure will be strong this year and possibly into next year,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email, “but that there is an eventual peak of capex spending by the hyperscalers, as early as next [calendar] year.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: AI Plays Help Lift Index to Record Close

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher in the first session of the new trading week as tech gains helped pushed major indexes to new highs, with earnings season set to pick up steam later in the week. The S&P 500 advanced 0.8% on Monday, adding to the benchmark index's all-time high Friday for a second straight record close. The Dow was up 0.5%, closing above the 43,000 level for the first time, and the Nasdaq gained 0.9%. Shares of power generator Vistra (VST) jumped 5.6% on Monday to notch the best daily performance of any S&P 500 constituent after BNP Paribas initiated coverage on the stock with an "outperform" rating. BNP also established a price target of $230 on Vistra shares, representing upside potential of around 74% from Monday's close. Vistra surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) last month as the S&P 500's top performer for 2024, riding a wave of enthusiasm around the company's opportunity to provide nuclear-generated power for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. It was also a strong day for semiconductor stocks, with shares of AI darling Nvidia reaching an all-time high after several bullish comments from Wall Street analysts. Citi analysts said yesterday Nvidia is “still king” when it comes to its client base in the AI accelerator market, and that its GPU sales to hyperscalers like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (MSFT) could double this year. Shares of Amentum (AMTM), which began trading last month following a spinoff from the engineering and construction firm Jacobs Solutions (J), were up 5.5%. The gains on Monday came after Truist initiated coverage of Amentum shares with a "buy" rating and $31 price target, suggesting over 9% upside as the company could outperform cost-savings forecasts. Shares of discount retailer Dollar General (DG) dropped 3.3%, marking the heaviest losses in the S&P 500 on Monday. Investment management firm Heartland Advisors published a report pinpointing Dollar General as one of the weakest-performing stocks in its midcap value fund during the third quarter. Shares of competitor Dollar Tree (DLTR) ended the session 3.1% lower. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) shares sank 3%. The downturn reversed a portion of the strong gains posted by the stock last week after RBC Capital analysts included CrowdStrike stock among their top picks in the software space, contending that the cybersecurity firm is successfully navigating the fallout from an incident in July when a malfunctioning software update caused extensive tech outages. However, CrowdStrike still faces potential repercussions from the incident. In its earnings report released last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL) cited the negative impact of the outage and said the carrier continues to seek compensation from the cybersecurity firm. Arch Capital Group (ACGL) shares slipped 2.9% after the specialty insurer announced a shakeup of its executive team. The company tapped Nicolas Papadopoulo to step into the chief executive officer (CEO) role and join the board of directors, effective immediately. Papadopoulo takes the reins from retiring CEO Marc Grandisson, who held the position since 2018. Shares of lithium producer Albemarle (ALB) fell 2.4% on Monday. The British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) announced last week that it would acquire Albemarle competitor Arcadium Lithium (ALTM) in an all-cash deal worth $6.7 billion. Albemarle was reportedly on Rio Tinto's radar as a potential takeover target before the multinational miner decided on Arcadium.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose again Monday in the wake of bullish comments from Wall Street analysts. The stock gained 2.4% to finish at a record closing high of $138.07 and has nearly tripled in value this year, as demand for the company’s chips to support artificial intelligence (AI) has surged. Shares are just shy of their intraday high of $140.76 set in June. Several stocks with ties to the chipmaker, including partners Arm Holdings (ARM), TSMC (TSM), and Nvidia-backed Soundhound AI (SOUN), gained Monday. The moves helped boost the tech sector, leading the S&P 500 index to a record high. In a note to clients Sunday, Citi analysts said Nvidia is “still king” when it comes to its client base in the AI accelerator market. They said they expect chipmaker’s GPU sales to hyperscalers like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (MSFT) will double this year. Citi and all but one of the other 22 analysts covering Nvidia tracked by Visible Alpha held a “buy” or equivalent rating on the stock as of Monday, with a consensus price target of $152.41, implying about 10% upside from Monday’s closing price. Citi’s comments come after Goldman Sachs analysts said Friday they came away from an investor meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang “with a better appreciation of the company’s competitive moat,” citing the company’s large customer base, “robust and growing” software offerings, and ability to innovate. The analysts said orders for Nvidia’s Blackwell chip are booked out with lead times extending up to a year, and that Nvidia “expects supply to remain tight for the foreseeable future.” Goldman Sachs analysts also maintained a "buy" rating on the stock, and raised their price target to $150 from $135 previously. A week ago, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world's second largest company by market capitalization, behind only Apple (AAPL). With Monday's gains, Nvidia's market cap is at $3.386 trillion, compared with Apple's $3.516 trillion. Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft are the only three companies with a market cap above $3 trillion.

Title: Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 clinch fresh highs as Nvidia surges to record

US stocks rose on Monday with two major indexes clinching record closes as Nvidia (NVDA) led a risk-on rally in the market that permeated through most sectors and even into cryptocurrencies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up nearly 0.8% to close at a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 200 points, or almost 0.5%, to close above the 43,000 level for the first time. Tech stocks led the day's gains, with chip giant Nvidia rising nearly 3% to close at a new high above $138 per share. Other semiconductor stocks also surged including chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Arm Holdings (ARM), and Applied Materials (AMAT). And the rally broadened even to cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8% on the day. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old. The Dow and S&P 500 entered this week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Nvidia rose nearly 3% to close above $138 per share for the first time ever. This surpassed Nvidia's prior record close of $135.58 in June. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Investors believe much of that funding could be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. That news was followed up by a swath of bullishness from Wall Street analysts as investors anxiously await the latest quarterly reports from Big Tech companies in the coming weeks. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller offered a sense of wariness when talking about the Fed's path forward for interest rate cuts. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Waller said Monday that the central bank needs to proceed with "more caution" when cutting rates as he absorbs recent data showing a strong job market and hotter-than-expected inflation. "Data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired," Waller said in a speech at Stanford University in California. "While we do not want to overreact to this data or look through it, I view the totality of the data as saying monetary policy should proceed with more caution on the pace of rate cuts than was needed at the September meeting." Read more here. The Federal Reserve held interest rates at multi-decade highs for more than a year. Investors took notice, piling into money market accounts to grab yield that hadn't been available in more than a decade. But since the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, the flows into money market accounts haven't stopped. In fact, through Oct. 10, research provided to Yahoo Finance from Crane Data shows that money market fund assets have increased by about $180 billion since the Fed began cutting rates. This reveals a truth about the surge of "cash on the sidelines" some have argued could be a reason for the stock market rally to continue. For starters, it could be a nod to the uncertainty some feel about where things will head over the next year. On Friday, Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients that "history does not lend much support to expectations of a cash-to-equity rotation." Kostin's research, as seen in our Chart of the Day, shows that since 1984, over the first three, six, and 12 month periods after the Fed begins cutting, flows into money market funds are greater than into equity or bond funds. Kostin expressed a view we've written about in the past, noting that whether or not equities see inflows following rate cuts has more to do with why the Fed is cutting than the cuts themselves. "Money market funds have historically experienced inflows following rate cuts regardless of the economic backdrop," Kostin said. "On the other hand, equity funds typically recorded inflows if the US economy avoided a recession and outflows if the US economy entered a recession shortly after the start of the cutting cycle." Goldman Sachs upgraded its China growth forecast over the weekend, citing recent stimulus measures and new commentary from government officials that showed an openness to spend more aggressively to revive its economy. The bank raised its full-year China GDP forecast to 4.9% from 4.7% and also upped its 2025 growth prediction to 4.7% from 4.3%. Beijing has previously said it's aiming for an annual growth target of "around 5%." On Saturday, China's finance ministry hinted at another large stimulus package to support the country's ailing property sector and suggested more government borrowing, although the ministry stopped short of unveiling the exact size or scale of spending. Although vague, the comments left the door open for a more aggressive fiscal package, which investors are increasingly betting on as Beijing attempts to pull itself out of a long slump spurred by deflationary pressures from a sluggish property market and weak domestic demand. Optimism that the government will follow through boosted Chinese stocks on Monday with the Shanghai Composite (000888.SS), a key indicator of the overall performance of the Chinese stock market, rising more than 2%. Similarly, China’s benchmark CSI 300 (000300.SS) finished the day up just under 2% to recover from last week's lows. The index is up 25% over the past month on the heels of China unleashing its most aggressive monetary stimulus since the pandemic. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. The world's largest cryptocurrency has been surging in recent days and is now up about 8% over the past five trading sessions. Other cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8%, in the past 24 hours. The risk-on rally in crypto is helping crypto-related US equities catch a bid too. Shares of Coinbase (COIN) are the leader in the space today, rising more than 8%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its massive rally on Monday, jumping as much as 9% as investors bet on former President Donald Trump's improved odds of winning the November election. Over the weekend, both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory, with prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. Separately, DJT announced the web launch of its Truth+ TV streaming service on Monday. The app is currently available to access on Android devices and will soon be released as a native Apple iOS app. DJT shares traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of the company's highly publicized lockup period last month. The stock has also been under pressure as previous polling saw Harris edging slightly ahead of the former president. Trump's recent campaign momentum follows an appearance by Elon Musk at his rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. Meanwhile, Harris has recently embarked on a flurry of media appearances in which she was pressed on how she would fund some of her proposals surrounding the economy and immigration. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said Monday that it’s "likely" the central bank will make "modest" interest rate reductions in the "coming quarters." Monetary policy, he said while speaking in Argentina, remains "overall restrictive," though how restrictive is unclear to him. The job market remains strong, he added, noting that recent data showed that a rapid weakening in that market doesn’t appear to be "imminent." Thus, "It appears likely that further modest reductions in our policy rate will be appropriate in the coming quarters to achieve both sides of our mandate," Kashkari said. Read more here. Technology and Utility stocks rose on Monday, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) up 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) up 0.6%. Both major averages were on pace to close at a fresh record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose the most among the major averages, up 0.7%. SoFi Technologies (SOFI) stock jumped as much as 9% after the online lender announced a $2 billion agreement with Fortress Investment Group to expand its loan platform business. The segment refers pre-qualified borrowers to loan origination partners and connects lenders with borrowers. The move reflects SoFi's strategy of diversifying from its roots in student loan refinancing. "SoFi’s loan platform business is an important part of our strategy to serve the financial needs of more members and diversify toward less capital-intensive and more fee-based sources of revenue," said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi, in a statement. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, only six recommend buying the stock, while 10 have Hold ratings and three have Sell ratings. The stock is up nearly 20% from last year but far from its record intraday high near $27 upon its IPO in 2021. Analysts see shares falling to $8.91 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club. TSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand. TSMC last week revealed third quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected, according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Some 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Boeing (BA) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week. On Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. "Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term," CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. S&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal. Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58. The stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus to upcoming big bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3% to eye a new record high. On Friday, the broader index ended above 5,800 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.5% soon after the bell on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2% from its Friday record close. Earnings season continues in full swing this week, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) among those expected to report. Oil futures dropped more than 2% as OPEC cut its demand forecast for 2024 and 2025. Traders also reacted to a lack of detail from China's Finance Minister over the weekend on any large new stimulus spending. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 1% in premarket trading to $136.22, putting the chipmaking giant on track to surpass its previous record closing price of $135.58 posted in June. The AI chipmaker's shares have made substantial gains in October following a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, much of which will be funneled back to Nvidia. AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have cited furious demand for the company's latest Blackwell chips. Its stock is up 8% over the past week. Nvidia's gains put it on track to once again claim the rank of No. 1 most valuable company in the world in terms of market capitalization. It currently holds the No. 2 position behind Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.3 trillion Monday, while Apple's was $3.46 trillion. Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect it to report revenue of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of those covering the stock and tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Mag 7 Become Drag 7, Taking Down QQQ & Create Opening For “Q Killers”
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/14/mag-7-become-drag-7-taking-down-qqq--create-opening-for-q-killers/
Time Published: 2024-10-14T17:28:20Z
Full Content:
Lately, the Mag 7 Have Become the Drag 7 The Magnificent Seven, led by Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Tesla helped major indices soar to new heights over the past decade. Since early February 2016, the S&P 500 has appreciated 265% while the QQQs nearly doubled that performance at 450%. Chief among the QQQ’s rise has been the tech heavy members of the Magnificent Seven (aka Mag 7). Each of the Mag 7 generated peak returns, that were in some cases, well above the 450% QQQ average. Standouts such as Nvidia (+21,280%), Tesla (+4000% peak return) and mega cap heavyweights, Apple (787% peak return), Microsoft (972% peak return) and Amazon (727% peak return) helped drive the exceptional performance. While the Mag 7 reached record levels, investors cheered. Who would publicly criticize a fund or index that produced exceptional results irrespective of disproportionate weights in only a handful of stocks? But what happens when these same 7 overweight stocks start to falter? Nothing good. The same Newtonian principles that drove stock prices and indexes higher, apply the same magic in reverse. Whatever goes up can come down. Seemingly overnight, the Mag 7 have become the Drag 7. Much of the appreciation occurs due to Market Cap weighted passive indices that do not easily change the mix of stocks or assigned weights. Consequently, as money flows into various funds, the index constituents are purchased automatically. This pushes the prices and market capitalizations of the stocks, and corresponding indices, higher. This is true irrespective of perceived valuation or price. There is no check or intervention as prices rise. And as more money flows in, the pace of appreciation and momentum rise even faster due to greater weight that the constituents hold. Passive indices hold to their prescribed rules and buy or sell in a pro rata fashion as dollars flow in or out. Although there are some benefits of a passive index, principally competitive, low fees and trading costs, there is an inherent flaw. There is generally no valuation overlay. And just as a few heavily weighted stocks can push an index higher as the prices go higher, the same will happen as heavily weighted stocks fall. This is what is happening now. Heavily weighted Mag 7 stocks are falling, due to active investors selling the stocks, and dragging major passive indices down. The cracks in the impenetrable Mag 7 base begin to appear around July 8, 2024. Since, that time period most of the Mag 7 have fallen. Though market dynamics can change at any time, this should be a concern for many investors in the future. The history of the Mag 7 began many years ago. For a long time the market leaders were referred to as the “FAANGs”. This acronym corresponded with: Facebook (before it became “Meta”), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Notable among the missing constituents were Microsoft and Nvidia. This was before Nvidia was recognized as an AI leader. At the time, investors were bullish on Netflix as a Covid stock darling. After Covid, Netflix fell and the moniker “FAANGs” was replaced with the broader grouping of “Mag 7”. Microsoft and Nvidia were added and Netflix disappeared. The Mag 7 proved to be a more powerful mix than the FAANGS. Investors enjoyed a strong bull market rally, and with each year, as more money flowed to passive ETFs, a disproportionate percentage of the funds went back into the Mag 7. Their market capitalizations swelled. Several companies reached $1 trillion market capitalization (META) then quickly became $2 trillion companies (AMZN and GOOGL) and then even faster to $3 trillion market cap valuations (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA). Never before had massive companies reached $1 trillion levels, let alone $2 trillion and $3 trillion. Moreover, the moves beyond $1 trillion moved with unprecedented speed. Money flowed into index funds, which pushed stock prices higher, that continued to replenish a buying cycle that added more buying pressure, which in turn, increased the stock weights of the Mag 7. Today, only a handful of stocks represent a disproportionate percentage of the weight in indexes with 100 or even 1000 companies. This is dangerous for investors and it violates the basic underlying investment principle of diversification by not putting too many eggs in one basket. By way of example, only 3 stocks (AAPL, MSFT and NVDA) now comprise 35% of the Russell 1000 Growth index. This is far too heavy and can create major problems for investors when these three stocks drop. Moreover, more than 1/2 or approximately 54% of the Russell 1000 Index now resides in the Mag 7. Concentration can be a terrific thing when the Mag 7 are rising. For example, in 2023 the Russell 1000 Growth Index generated a return of 42.60% and the Mag 7 contributed 62% of the total performance. It was even more concentrated for the Invesco QQQ which generated a return of 54.85% with 68% of the performance originating from the Mag 7. However, the table below shows what can happen when the heavy concentration in the Mag 7 starts to falter. While the concentration is terrific when the stocks rise, it can be devastating when those stocks start to decline. This is the interesting characteristic that is happening to the Magnificent Seven lately. Some of the constituents are dropping and, more importantly, rather than creating wealth for investors, at least 5 of the 7 members, are starting to lose wealth. The table below illustrates. Magnificent 7 Performance Since July 8, 2024 to Oct 11, 2024 Since July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024, five of the Mag 7 have fallen and the Tech heavy QQQ index has been negative (-0.66%). The worst performer since July 8, is TSLA (-13.89%), followed by GOOGL (-13.53%), MSFT (-10.55%), AMZN (-5.25%) and AAPL. This has far reaching ramifications for asset allocation among portfolio managers who currently invest in large capitalization, growth-oriented baskets. Despite holding hundreds of stocks in their funds, the preponderance of the equity weights reside among only a handful of securities. Perhaps, equally important, due to the heavy concentrations of just a few securities in an index, pension consultants and other fiduciaries, whose job it is to advise clients, may find that they may soon experience legal exposure by not better diversifying their clients’ portfolios. The Table below shows the performance of the QQQ relative to another Index with a similar correlation to Technology stocks, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR). The ER30TR Index does not hold 4 (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA) of the Mag 7 and is underweight 2 others (GOOGL, NVDA). In this particular case, the returns for the period July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024 were a positive 6.7% for the ER30TR while negative 0.66% for the QQQ. (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). QQQ's Are Negative Since 07/08/2024 to Present (10/11/2024) The returns year to date (YTD) have shown similar results. While the QQQ have generated a solid 20.99% YTD, they fall below the 23.24% SPX (S&P 500) and pale next to the 41.63% for the Entrepreneur 30 (ER30TR). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Stock Indexes YTD (through Oct. 11, 2024) Moreover, in the context of longer periods, it is clear that the Invesco QQQ have prospered since January 2023. In the time period January 1, 2023 through October 11, 2024, the Invesco QQQ generated an impressive 87.25% return with exactly 2/3 of the return coming from the Mag 7. This is well above the SPX return of 55.22% and far above the 33.80% return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, the performance could have been much better. As the table illustrates below, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index provided a return of 122.22% during the same time period with a little over 1/3 of its total return coming from the Mag 7. Moreover, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index had only 21% of its weight coming from the Mag 7 whereas the Mag 7 represent approximately 46% of the Invesco QQQ. In other words, despite the strong performance of the Mag 7, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index provided 1.4X the return of the QQQ (122% vs 87%) with less than 1/2 the weight of the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ) and less than 1/2 the performance coming from the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Index Performances Since 12/31/2022 Is it fair to compare an index with 30 holdings with an index that has 100 holdings? If the holdings were equal weighted, then the answer would be “no”. However, in the case of the Entrepreneur 30TR (ER30TR), the weights in the Mag 7 were only 21% vs 46% for the Invesco QQQ. This means that despite having more constituents in the Invesco QQQ, the weights in the Mag 7 were much more concentrated. Moreover, 2/3 of the total returns in the QQQ were from the Mag 7, whereas only 1/3 of the returns for the ER30TR were from the Mag 7. This means that it is possible to have fewer stocks in an Index, yet have less concentration and greater returns. As a result, many investors are now beginning to seek alternatives to the concentrated nature of the QQQ and Russell 1000 Growth. Could the ER30TR be the new replacement?(Note: past performance is no guarantee or guide to future returns). Overall returns, led by the Mag 7, have generated extraordinary returns for Tech heavy indices over the past few years. But concentration to just a handful of securities becomes dangerous when the heavily-weighted holdings begin to drop. Several popular indices, such as the Russell 1000 Growth and Invesco QQQ have seen their assets under management (AUM) ascend to hundreds of billions of dollars during the past few years. The Russell 1000 Growth is now approaching $100 Billion and the Invesco QQQ are nearing $300 Billion. With each index holding approximately 1/2 its weight in the Mag 7, this implies that 2 indices, control nearly $200 Billion of the Mag 7. Many other funds and indices, as well as private funds, pension funds, SMAs (separately managed accounts) control similar weights. This concentration can be devastating to investors as the Mag 7 decline. Investors are now seeking alternatives and discovering that it may be possible to achieve higher returns with less concentration—at least for certain periods of time. The QQQ have had an extraordinary growth record in raising AUM. If the concentrated Mag 7 continue to falter, replacement indices may soon become prevalent. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please refer to the below disclosures: https://lnkd.in/e29X6rN

Title: NVIDIA’s Annualized R&D Expenses Are Now Running At 2X The Rate Of AMD’s

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Research and development (R&D) expenses are one of the highest quality markers of future revenue growth. Given NVIDIA's heightened revenue projections for the upcoming quarters, it is hardly a surprise that it is now absolutely dominating its peers, including AMD, when it comes to the R&D metric. $NVDA is widening the R&D gap with its closest competitor. Annualizing last quarter's R&D spend, NVDA is investing now almost at twice the level of $AMD. And the latter will have to split R&D between GPUs, CPUs and FPGAs, whereas NVDA can fully focus on building out the AI stack. pic.twitter.com/nL4BpTPNeU — Tech Fund (@techfund1) October 14, 2024 To wit, NVIDIA recorded $3.090 billion in R&D expenses for its July-ending quarter. Annualizing this figure yields $12.36 billion as the GPU manufacturer's cumulative (probable) R&D metric for the previous 1 quarter and the next 3 quarters. In contrast, AMD recorded $1.593 billion in R&D expenses for its June-ending quarter. Annualizing this figure yields $6.372 billion as the the company's cumulative (probable) R&D metric for the previous 1 quarter and the next 3 quarters. In other words, NVIDIA is now investing ~2x AMD's R&D expenses, based on the current annualized projections. This marks a significant deviation of pace from back in 2013, when both companies were investing almost identical amounts in their respective R&D activities. Since then, however, NVIDIA has continued to invest a higher amount into its R&D activities, and is now enjoying the fruits of those investments. What's more, AMD has to divide its R&D resources between its CPU, GPU, and FPGA segments. In contrast, NVIDIA is increasingly directing its resources towards building out AI racks, which only furthers the GPU manufacturer's lead in this highly competitive segment. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, William Blair now sees NVIDIA's FY 2025 revenue at a whopping $110 billion. To put this figure into context, the company's FY 2023 revenue was just $15 billion! Bear in mind that NVIDIA's GB200 CPU+GPU combo is currently priced between $60,000 and $70,000, while a single NVIDIA B100 AI accelerator costs between $30,000 and $35,000. What's more, the company's 72-chip AI rack is now priced at between $2 million and $3 million. $NVDA CEO: "We’re not trying to take any share from anybody. NVIDIA is a market maker, not a share taker. If you look at our company slides, not one day does this company talk about market share. All we’re talking about is how do we create the next thing? What’s the next problem… https://t.co/eya7xp7WSm — The Transcript (@TheTranscript_) October 13, 2024 In a recent interview with Altimeter Capital, NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang asserted that existing data centers will need around $1 trillion dollar worth of GPUs in the next 4 to 5 years to modernize and remain abreast with the evolving demand environment.

Title: Nvidia stock eyes record high, looks to unseat Apple as world's most valuable company

Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on track to notch a record high as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company. Shares rose over 3% morning trading Monday to $137.87. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. Nvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains. The stock’s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive, $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips. Nvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by a barrage of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday. Nvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a mega-factory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Nvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday morning, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia’s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China, due to rising trade tensions with the US, had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June. Other recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term. “AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.” The chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown. Semiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs (graphics processing units). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.” Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Stock market today: S&P 500 heads for record high, Nasdaq jumps as Nvidia surges

US stocks rose on Monday to head for fresh record highs as Nvidia stock climbed and investors prepared for more big bank earnings to test that rally and the chances of an economic "soft landing." The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up 0.7% to head for a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped around 1% as Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose toward new highs, up about 3.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered above the flatline. Earnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old. The Dow and S&P 500 closed a winning week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday. At the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing "sticky" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy — the preferred soft landing. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards On the corporate front, Boeing (BA) shares slipped almost 3% amid questions about the crisis-hit plane maker's future. The company, which faces a record $5 billion in third quarter losses, has slashed 17,000 jobs as a month-long strike hits manufacturing. The the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday. Meanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club. TSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second-quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand. TSMC last week revealed third-quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion. Some 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Boeing (BA) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week. On Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce. "Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term," CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. S&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal. Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58. The stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus to upcoming big bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3% to eye a new record high. On Friday, the broader index ended above 5,800 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.5% soon after the bell on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2% from its Friday record close. Earnings season continues in full swing this week, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) among those expected to report. Oil futures dropped more than 2% as OPEC cut its demand forecast for 2024 and 2025. Traders also reacted to a lack of detail from China's Finance Minister over the weekend on any large new stimulus spending. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 1% in premarket trading to $136.22, putting the chipmaking giant on track to surpass its previous record closing price of $135.58 posted in June. The AI chipmaker's shares have made substantial gains in October following a massive, $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, much of which will be funneled back to Nvidia. AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have cited furious demand for the company's latest Blackwell chips. Its stock is up 8% over the past week. Nvidia's gains put it on track to once again claim the rank of No. 1 most valuable company in the world, in terms of market capitalization. It currently holds the No. 2 position, behind Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.3 trillion Monday, while Apple's was $3.46 trillion. Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year. Nvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect it to report revenue of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, not only struck all of the right chords in a recent interview but went a step further to highlight the mind-boggling scale of the market opportunity that NVIDIA has yet to capitalize on. While NVIDIA investors have been busy scrutinizing the choice tidbits from this expansive interview, the streamed interaction is also gaining traction for the flowery language that Huang used for the CEO of Tesla and xAI, Elon Musk. Jensen casually explains the killing of Investment Banking and Consulting Analyst programs. ☠️ $NVDA 👀 “EVERY SINGLE APPLICATION - Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Photoshop, Premier, AutoCAD - you give me your favorite application…I promise you it will be HIGHLY machine learned in… pic.twitter.com/yRnZhzQgBT — Compound248 💰 (@compound248) October 13, 2024 To wit, in a recent interview with Altimeter Capital, Jensen Huang asserted that NVIDIA's ongoing bullish case is nothing like the mania around Cisco at the apex of the dot-com bubble. Specifically, Huang believes that NVIDIA is "reinventing computing" and that the future will be "highly machine learned." “Moore’s Law has largely ended.” Jensen Huang on why Nvidia will replace ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of the $1 trillion CPU-based data center TAM with GPU. “We’ve reinvented computing, we’re not going back. “Imagine you have $50B of CapEx to spend: “Option A, Option B; build CapEx… https://t.co/NG9KgX5XCZ pic.twitter.com/xbXqG5uKYC — Compound248 💰 (@compound248) October 13, 2024 In another remarkable take that is rightly going viral, NVIDIA's CEO believes that the Moore's Law as we know it has ended, and, therefore, in order to extract the requisite computing power to keep pace with the compute-hungry software of the future, existing data centers will need around $1 trillion dollar worth of GPUs in the next 4 to 5 years to modernize and remain abreast with the evolving demand environment. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talking about xAI and Elon Musk pic.twitter.com/tPrwPzWozO — Evan (@StockMKTNewz) October 13, 2024 Of course, another clip that is going viral, particularly among Elon Musk's vast fan base, relates to Huang's flowery language when he describes how xAI was able to bring together NVIDIA's gear and operationalize it within its own data center in just 17 days, when typically it would take a lot longer. NVIDIA's CEO noted: "... Just building a massive factory, liquid-cooled, energized, permitted in the short time that was done...I mean that is, like, superhuman. Yeah, there's. And, as far as I know, there's only one person in the world who could do that. You know, I mean, Elon is singular in this understanding of engineering and construction and large systems, and marshaling resources ..." Meanwhile, as we noted in a dedicated post recently, NVIDIA's entire supply of its latest Blackwell GPUs is already sold out for the next 12 months as demand for those chips remains "insane." It is hardly a surprise, therefore, that NVIDIA shares currently remain just shy of their existing all-time high stock price of $140.76.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable NASDAQ stocks. Recent analysis indicates that an anticipated tech rally may be delayed until year-end, despite the S&P 500 achieving a remarkable 20% increase year-to-date. As September closed, the index rose by 1.6%, defying its historical volatility and showcasing market resilience. Positive macroeconomic indicators are emerging, with upward revisions to Q3 growth estimates and low jobless claims, suggesting a stable economic foundation. However, concerns about sustaining market momentum without new catalysts persist. Historically, stock prices and price-to-earnings multiples rise together unless disrupted by negative events. As the market approaches traditionally strong months following elections, expectations for a potential year-end rally are building. Despite elevated volatility and geopolitical tensions, investor caution remains. The NASDAQ 100 has surged significantly over the past two years, but this performance does not yet indicate speculative excess. In the last days of September, DataTrek Research co-founder, Nick Colas, joined CNBC to discuss the trading day and highlighted his outlook on the NASDAQ during the conversation. We covered his views in our article on the 10 Best Performing NASDAQ Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it: “...Over the past two years, the NASDAQ 100 has surged approximately 67%, marking a significant recovery since its lows in October two years ago. This performance is substantially above the historical average return of around 25%. Colas emphasized that while such returns are impressive, they do not yet indicate speculative excess; historically, a doubling of the NASDAQ over two years would signal potential trouble for investors. Looking back further, Colas noted that since peaking before the bear market in November 2021, the NASDAQ 100 has only risen about 20% over three years. This suggests that there may still be room for growth compared to prior bubbles when returns were much more pronounced within shorter time frames.” In a recent discussion on October 9, Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss the tech sector's mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Despite these challenges, Jason Snipe noted that the tech sector is having a positive day, attributing this to a combination of improved earnings estimates across various sectors and substantial investments in AI-related capital expenditures. He emphasized that ~40% of operating cash flow is being allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will start to yield returns. This focus on AI has contributed to some recent downgrades but also suggests continued upside potential for select names within the sector. Snipe further defended the tech space by highlighting the profit margins of mega-cap stocks, which average over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors. This discrepancy indicates a strong reason for ongoing capital inflows into tech and software companies that demonstrate earnings strength. He acknowledged that while there may be some consolidation and a slowdown in growth, he believes that investors' muscle memory will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks. When discussing NVIDIA's recent performance, Snipe pointed to comments made by the CEO regarding the endless demand for their Blackwell chip as a significant catalyst for the stock's movement. He expressed confidence that it would exceed earnings expectations when they report later in the earnings season. However, Snipe also addressed concerns regarding Amazon, which has seen its stock decline for 8 of the last 9 days. He noted that its retail business appears to be struggling, with retail making up 62% of its operations. Despite this, he highlighted AWS as a bright spot, which reported a 19% year-over-year acceleration. He suggested that competition from other retailers could pressure its retail margins but remained optimistic about the company's diverse revenue streams, including advertising and subscription services. Snipe's analysis underscores the complexities facing the tech sector amid market volatility and evolving economic conditions. While challenges persist, particularly with mega-cap stocks experiencing downgrades, there are also significant opportunities driven by innovation and strong profit margins that could support continued growth in this space. As expert sentiments shift regarding MAG7 and other big tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining their positive momentum in the market. Methodology We sifted through Finviz to compile an initial list of the top NASDAQ stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 20 companies with positive TTM net income and 5-year net income compound annual growth rates. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. TTM Net Income: $53 billion 5-Year Net Income CAGR: 80.81% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are applied in gaming, artificial intelligence, data centers, and professional visualization. It's known for its innovative technology and its role in driving advancements in fields like machine learning and deep learning. Impax Asset Management, a $50 billion asset manager, has increased its stake in NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) after underestimating the company's potential. The firm believes the company is currently undervalued, considering the growing demand for its chips driven by the AI boom. Impax also sees the focus on energy efficiency as a positive factor from a climate perspective. The company achieved significant growth in FQ2 2025, with revenue surging 122.40% from a year-ago period. The data center segment was the primary driver of this growth, with revenue increasing 54% due to strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers accounted for a significant portion of data center revenue, contributing to the company's impressive financial performance. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and increasing demand for AI-powered diagnostic solutions also played a role. Its technology is used by various companies, including NetApp, which recently unveiled a new AI-powered data solution in late September. Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, is also utilizing NVIDIA's H100 GPUs for its Colossal AI training system. Its focus on AI monetization and sustainability initiatives positions the company for long-term success. While the stock may seem expensive, its valuation is reasonable considering its growth prospects. Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the most profitable NASDAQ stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The new reality for big food stocks: Shrinkflation, upset shoppers, and excessive meat sticks

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The investor appetite for big food stocks is as thin as I was back in the mid-1980s. Note in that time period I was about five years old. "From a generalist investor standpoint, I would say it has been pretty quiet [around packaged food names]. Your typical kind of institutional money has been quieter in the space," youthful, energetic packaged food analyst at Bank of America Peter Galbo said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below). The way Galbo explained it to me, investors are in search of faster-growth stocks ahead of a prolonged stretch of Fed rate cuts. Think of the desire to devour Nvidia (NVDA) shares on any dip, as opposed to eating up General Mills (GIS) on a pullback. You can easily see that in some Yahoo Finance-sourced data. Nvidia's stock is up a sizzling 168% year to date. General Mills is only up 10%. PepsiCo (PEP) and Conagra Brands (CAG) are both up roughly 2%. Hormel (HRL) is down 4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up 21% this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) 13%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) 20%. But as I digested (pun intended) my in-depth chat with Galbo, I think there are a few other fundamental reasons that are keeping these companies out of investor shopping baskets (pun also intended). Your shopping list of explanations: The companies are still too big inside an investing world that's no longer rewarding the conglomerate model. Investors want focused strategies executing at the highest level. For instance, does Conagra Brands need to be selling frozen food and also hawking Slim Jim and Duke's meat snacks? Should Spam maker Hormel have purchased the Planters nut business from Kraft Heinz (KHC) a few years ago? The companies want to get even bigger despite investors not rewarding the play! Conagra Brands just purchased the Fatty meat snacks line. The company now has the meat snacks market cornered with Slim Jim, Duke's, and Fatty. Galbo tells me meat snacks are a growth category in snacking. Fair, but I question why one must own three meat snack brands! The companies are slow to slim down their slower-growth businesses. Only recently did General Mills sell off its North American yogurt business for $2 billion. Campbell Soup is hunting for a buyer for the Noosa yogurt business it got with its Rao's business. I didn't get the sense from Hormel's latest earnings call it's going to sell the Planters business amid signs the deal may not be working out as planned. Consumers are pissed off at Big Food for its pricing strategies and are voicing their views by purchasing less. You saw that in PepsiCo's volumes this week. The cumulative effects of four years of inflation continue to pressure so many households. Buying snacks is now a luxury. Traffic at convenience store stores has really trailed off the past year for economic reasons, but shopping has also shifted to club stores such as Costco (COST). Convenience store channels need to be doing well for a lot of food players to do well. The Ozempic threat on the long-term health of Big Food earnings power is rising every single day as new users of these drugs enter the market. Bonus reason: The stocks aren't valued for the realities listed above. They are still being seen as defensive value plays since the companies sell food. That's the wrong way to think about it, I believe — it's hard to defend Hormel trading at almost 19 times forward earnings, which isn't too far removed from the S&P 500's forward multiple around 21 times. An old rule of thumb in investing is that a 15 times forward P/E multiple is on the attractive side (I caution this is not always the case and each company is unique, so don't use my line as gospel). Then, there is raw commentary that I would argue is weighing on the sector's multiples. First up: These companies have become political punching bags this election season. Vice President Kamala Harris has vowed to tackle price gouging by Big Food if she wins the White House in November. Senator Elizabeth Warren has been making the rounds talking about shrinkflation and taking food companies to task for it. All of this rhetoric doesn't exactly embolden investors to go search for diamonds in the rough in the food space. There is also what we are hearing from consumer company executives, which suggests a strong rebound in sales and earnings isn't guaranteed in 2025. "We see that [the] consumer is very challenged, and that the consumer is making a lot of decisions. They're optimizing their full budget, so they might be cutting on food to pay for their subscriptions, or they might be cutting on food to go to see movies on the weekend. Really, there is a lot of trade-offs they're making when it comes to food." PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta told me this past week moments after earnings hit the wires. The company trimmed its full-year sales outlook. This aligns with what Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon told me last week at the retailer's Bentonville, Ark., HQ. "People at lower income levels are always more challenged. They have to make trade-off decisions, and that's been, I think, more acute since this inflationary cycle on the heels of the pandemic. So, a household income below $100,000 feels pressure in a way that they might not have a few years ago, and you can see that in their behavior. And we are trying to get prices down ... some of the more stubborn inflation has been in the prepared foods, dry grocery type, consumable categories, like paper goods, cleaning supplies," McMillon said. I wish Big Food well in regaining the hunger of investors. After all, these companies do feed the planet. It will be tough, however.

Title: What To Watch As Third-Quarter 2024 Earnings Season Begins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/13/what-to-watch-as-third-quarter-2024-earnings-season-begins/
Time Published: 2024-10-13T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Earnings growth is expected to decelerate to a 4.4% year-over-year pace in the third quarter from ... [+] the double-digit pace of the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, earnings growth was expected to decelerate to a 4.4% year-over-year pace in the third quarter from the double-digit pace of the second quarter. Topline sales were forecasted to grow by 4.7% year-over-year in the third quarter. Forward earnings guidance will be crucial as consensus earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year 2025 were predicted to increase by 14.8% and 15%, respectively. S&P 500 Earnings Estimates Earnings season began last Friday with a handful of companies, dominated by financials, reporting earrings. 44 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report earnings this week, heavily emphasizing banks, but many industries are represented. Among the banks reporting are Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and PNC Financial (PNC). There are a smattering of other companies on the calendar, like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), CSX (CSX), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Progressive (PGR). S&P 500 Earnings Season JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) reported better-than-expected earnings last Friday, getting the bank earnings season off to a good start. According to FactSet, the blended earnings growth rate for the financial sector increased to 1.6% from -0.7% year-over-year due to the better earnings from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. The pace of loan growth for the banking industry has been slow, which should weigh on earnings growth. However, investment banking and wealth management revenues continue to benefit from strong markets, benefitting earnings at the money center banks relative to smaller banks. Bank Loan Growth The technology sector should report the most robust earnings growth at 15.5% year-over-year. NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA) should be the most significant contributor to the sector’s earnings. NVIDIA’s profits are expected to soar by 84% year-over-year on the strength of demand for artificial intelligence semiconductors. According to FactSet, the sector’s earnings growth would be 7.5% without the boost from NVIDIA. After some poor headline growth numbers for healthcare due primarily to acquisition-related write-offs, the sector should show some earnings life this quarter at 11.2% year-over-year growth. Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Moderna (MRNA) are expected to be the primary drivers of the profit increase, according to FactSet. The communications services sector rounds out the top three in forecasted year-over-year earnings growth at 10.5%. Not surprisingly, Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to be responsible for most of the growth. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector The energy sector earnings are forecasted to have the worst showing for the third quarter, with a 19.1% year-over-year decline. Natural gas and oil prices fell, resulting in an expected decline in revenues for the energy industry. Energy Commodities Two of Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKA, BRKB) top ten largest publicly traded stock holdings are Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Chevron (CVX). Berkshire has amassed an almost 28% stake in Occidental. A previous piece discussed why Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway favors Occidental Petroleum. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Sales growth is typically closely tied to nominal GDP growth, combining after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Estimated 5% nominal year-over-year economic growth supports the consensus estimate of a 4.7% year-over-year sales increase for the S&P 500 with some upside. GDP Growth Drives S&P 500 Sales Despite a more challenging start to the year, the pace of inflation growth has seen a general downtrend, which should help earnings this quarter. U.S. CPI Year-Over-Year The differential in price growth for producer’s input costs (PPI) versus the price increases hitting consumers (CPI) indicates that profit margins should be able to hold steady or increase this quarter. The topline sales growth, driven by economic activity in the quarter and supportive margins, allows positive year-over-year earnings growth expectations. Margins & Inflation The slightly weaker U.S. dollar could positively impact earnings growth from multinational companies this quarter. With approximately 40% of the sales of S&P 500 companies coming from international sources, the dollar can impact profits for companies selling products internationally. U.S. Dollar Softens Following the robust monthly jobs report, the markets repriced the pace of expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. Fed Fund futures now indicate a slightly less than 100% probability of a 25 basis point (0.25%) cut in November and December. The September retail sales reading on Thursday is the next significant indicator of the strength of the U.S. consumer and economy. Fed Rate Cuts Expected The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have continued to outperform the less sensitive defensives, implying that stocks are pricing in a higher probability that the U.S. avoids an economic recession. The relative performance of cyclicals versus defensives is nearing the trailing one-year high, reached in mid-July 2024. Cyclicals Versus Defensives The third quarter’s mid-single-digit year-over-year earnings gains provide a seemingly low hurdle for this earnings season. The profit growth should be achievable, assisted by topline sales boosted by solid economic growth. With the fear of recession fading reflected in stock prices and faster earnings growth expected for the fourth quarter and 2025, more attention will likely be paid to management’s future earnings guidance than the third quarter’s earnings beats. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), CSX (CSX), Wells Fargo (WFC), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), NVIDIA (NVDA), Chevron (CVX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) within its recommended investment strategies.

Market volatility, high interest rates, inflation and the upcoming presidential election haven't affected the investment strategies of most exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors. Most ETF investors surveyed by Charles Schwab (SCHW) Asset Management said that these economic and political events did not change the way they invest in ETFs. In fact, roughly a third of the investors put more money into ETFs based on their reading of stock market volatility, high interest rates and persistent inflation, according to the survey results released this week. ETFs have a track record across market cycles, said David Botset, Managing Director, Head of Innovation and Stewardship at Schwab Asset Management, adding that "investors are confident in their investments even when the outlook is uncertain.” ETF investors have grown more bullish on certain types of stocks and sectors since last year: 69% are bullish on technology and 60% on growth stocks. Additionally, 55% of investors are optimistic about the the Magnificent 7, a group of seven mega-cap technology companies including Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). The Mag 7 stocks have a big influence on the stock markets and have driven much of the S&P 500's returns over the past year. But when they falter, as they did in July this year, they tend to drag the broader stock market down with them. The survey also showed how investment preferences vary across generations. For instance, 62% of millennials (or those born between 1981 and 1996), said they plan to invest in cryptocurrency ETFs over the next year versus 15% of Boomers (or those born between 1946 and 1964). A quarter of millennials said they plan to invest in alternatives ETFs, compared with just 11% of boomers. At the same time, 44% of millennials also want to increase their exposure to lower-risk fixed income ETFs. In contrast, fewer GenX (34%) and Boomer (26%) investors plan to do likewise. This is in line with other recent studies that point to recent stock market volatility making millennials more risk-averse compared to some older generations.

Title: How Interest Rates Will Impact This 7%+ Closed-End Fund

Small Cap write on sticky notes isolated on Office Desk. Stock market concept Normally when interest rates fall, we closed-end fund (CEF) investors are tempted to pick up a fund like the 7.3%-paying Royce Small-Cap Trust (RVT). It seems like a particularly savvy move today, with this small cap–focused CEF trading at a 10.3% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Cheap! But is that really a good value, or could RVT get cheaper still? Let’s take a look, starting with small caps generally. Like large caps, they benefit as lower rates boost consumer spending. But there are two other factors that make falling-rate periods particularly advantageous for smaller firms: With that in mind—plus the fact that small caps tend to be more domestic-focused, helping shield them from global instability—you’d think investors would’ve bid them to the moon this year, right? Well, not so much. Small Caps Lag So far, traders aren’t calling for a small-cap rebound, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), in purple above, trailing the benchmark S&P 500 ETF (in orange). (IWM invests in all 2000 small caps that make up the primary US small-cap index, the Russell 2000.) We normally love a contrarian setup like this at my CEF Insider service, but this time I think the herd has a point. It’s true that lower rates encourage people to spend more. But remember too that rates tend to be cut during a recession. And in a recession, Americans are already cutting spending. So lower rates do tend to push up consumer spending in those times—albeit from an already-low base. However, when Americans are already spending a lot, as they are today, cutting rates won’t necessarily do much. Spending Ticks Higher As you can see above, the big jump in interest rates we’ve seen, from near nothing to 5.5% in just 18 months, didn’t slow consumer-spending growth. So it doesn’t make sense that consumer spending will grow with lower rates; that’s usually the case, but probably won’t be this time. What about the buying-on-margin story? That idea is a bit broken, too. Margin Loans, Interest Rates As you can see, the lower cost of borrowing on margin (related to the federal funds rate, in red above) made for a huge amount of margin borrowing (the blue line) during the pandemic. But margin balances went back to their normal trend in 2022, when rates rose. This, by the way, is the main reason why stocks tanked that year. In other words, the market has already gotten to a “normal” level of margin borrowing. Rates falling from 5% to 3%, where the Fed has said it wants them to settle, isn’t going to cause that speculative buying of small-cap stocks like we saw shortly after the pandemic—or for that matter, in the 2010s, when rates were also low. That also means this chart is unlikely to repeat itself. IWM Tracks SPY In the low-rate 2010s, small caps started from being oversold during the Great Recession. But even with the low starting point, they merely tracked the S&P 500. In other words, investing in small caps based on the idea that others will borrow to invest in them wasn’t a great move when rates were at 0.25%, let alone 3%. Which leads me to the final point: small caps’ investments in innovation. Technology has become a big part of the total US stock market because tech firms have provided tremendous innovation over the last decade: Companies from across the economy depend more on Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and the like more than ever. That trend has been running since the end of the dot-com bubble. The current scramble among big firms to integrate AI just exacerbates it. And that’s why the top constituents of IWM, the main small-cap index fund, are a worry. IWM Top Holdings There are good companies in here, like FTAI Aviation (FTAI), which repairs and maintains jet engines. But, as a few industry reports note (like this one and this one), the big aviation firms, like Boeing (BA) and Airbus, already use AI to improve their aircraft-maintenance services. So smaller firms like FTAI will need to invest in cutting-edge AI tech to compete. That’s squeezes smaller companies’ profits more than those of larger firms. But the main winners are those that provide the AI infrastructure both the FTAIs and Boeings need—companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) and NVIDIA (NVDA). This brings us back to RVT. While its yield sounds great, at 7.3%, it’s actually low for CEFs, which yield 8.2% on average. And while we love being contrarians at CEF Insider, in this case we can’t be, since RVT’s past performance shows that it should actually be cheaper. Let me explain. RVT Total Returns Price RVT’s market price (in purple above) has been beating IWM by a healthy margin over the last decade. But if we compare IWM to RVT’s total NAV return, which reflects the actual performance of the CEF’s managers, things look different. RVT Total Returns NAV RVT has actually been tracking the small-cap index for a long time, and if its discount falls to 15% or lower, that’d be a great entry point. But at a 10.3% discount, given its 10-year average discount of 11.1%, RVT is still not a great deal for us. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Why Analysts Say They're Bullish on AMD Stock After AI Event Disappointed

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) may have disappointed investors with its Advancing AI event Thursday, but analysts said they're still bullish on the chipmaker's growth prospects. While AMD unveiled a number of new AI products at the event, Jefferies analysts said investors may have been looking for clearer signs of competition with Nvidia (NVDA) and a new customer announcement, as well as "the potential for a raise of the AI guidance to $5 billion, which is likely now left to earnings." Shares of AMD fell 4% Thursday after the event, though they recovered some of those losses with a just over 2% gain Friday. Bank of America analysts said AMD's latest Instinct MI325X GPU “remains a full year behind NVDA's latest Blackwell, with no near-term catalyst to change the dynamic." Jefferies analysts suggested AMD's MI350 next year "would compete more favorably" with Nvidia's Blackwell, "leaving AMD chasing NVDA for now." However, the analysts said they believe AMD's new AI chips could still "drive further share gains" as companies race to build out their AI infrastructure, with "enough demand to go around." Jefferies maintained its "buy" rating for the stock and price target of $190, a more than 13% premium over Friday's closing price of $167.89. Bank of America also maintained a "buy" rating with a price objective of $180. About three-quarters or 13 of the other 17 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha also held "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock as of Friday, with a consensus target of $192.13.

Title: Treasury Yields Have Been Rising. How Might That Affect Your Stock Portfolio?

Time Published: 2024-10-11T20:03:53Z

The yield on 10-year Treasurys crossed 4.1% for the first time since July this week, extending an ascent that has paradoxically coincided with the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen by about half a percentage point since dipping below 3.6% on Sept. 17, the day before the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark federal funds rate from its highest level in more than 20 years. Stock investors are often unnerved by rising yields for a few reasons. First, they draw money away from the stock market and lower stock valuations by increasing the yield on lower-risk fixed-income securities. Second, they discourage consumer and business borrowing, weighing on economic growth and corporate profits in the process. Yet rising Treasury yields haven't stood in the way of stocks in recent weeks. The S&P 500 on Friday closed at its 45th record high of the year as the 10-year yield was at a two-month high. Major stock indexes have posted gains in five consecutive weeks. Stocks have been supported lately by growing conviction on Wall Street that the U.S. economy’s strength can support corporate profits. Earnings have mostly held up through years of elevated interest rates, and the Fed’s easing cycle—whether aggressive or more measured—should mostly be a tailwind for business and stocks. Bank of America analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 15% next year. They also forecast growth will continue to broaden beyond the Magnificent Seven—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—which accounted for an outsized share of the index’s earnings growth and market performance in 2023. The "Other 493," the earnings of which were declining or stagnant throughout 2023 and early 2024, are expected to record double-digit earnings growth in each of the next five quarters. According to one study from British asset manager Schroders, rising yields compressed stock valuations in 6 of the 11 periods between 1970 and 2021 that they characterize as "rising yield environments." And yet stocks advanced in all but two of those periods because earnings grew fast enough to offset lower valuations. Few experts expect the 10-year yield to rise much further than it already has, another reason yields are unlikely to derail the bull market. “The US economy is healthy & unlikely to see recession near term but it also doesn't appear to be meaningfully re-accelerating,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a recent note. They expect the Fed to continue cutting rates next year, and forecast the 10-year yield will sit around 3.75% at the end of both 2024 and 2025. Lawrence Gillum, Chief Fixed Income Strategist at LPL Financial, sees a little more room for rates to tick up but still expects yields to fluctuate within a 3.75-4.25% range throughout the rest of the year. The surprising strength of the U.S. economy is a key reason for the peculiar divergence between interest rates and yields. The unemployment rate declined in September when the U.S. added far more jobs than expected, according to data from the Labor Department released last week. And inflation ran slightly hot in September, according to data released Thursday. That’s led Wall Street to doubt the Fed will need to continue aggressively cutting rates to prevent an economic crisis. Last month, the prevailing view among market participants was that the Fed would lower rates by another 75 basis points (0.75%) before the end of the year. Now, the market sees no chance the Fed will move that quickly, according to fed fund futures trading data. As the outlook for interest rates has changed, so has the market price of Treasurys and, subsequently, their yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices. When investors think that interest rates are going to be lower in the future than they are now, that increases the price—and decreases the yield—of Treasurys trading on the secondary market because they’re expected to pay a higher coupon than future debt. The opposite happens when investors think interest rates will be higher in the future, and the strength of recent labor market data has convinced Wall Street of that.

Title: What Happens When a Stock Is Dropped From the S&P 500?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/delisting-a-stock-from-the-s-and-p-500-8721818
Time Published: 2024-10-11T17:11:35Z
Full Content:
Being listed on the S&P 500 is a hallmark of success for many companies, symbolizing market leadership and investor confidence. However, it's not uncommon for companies to sometimes be delisted from this prestigious index. In fact, the average life span of a company on the S&P 500 is about 21 years. Delisting can occur for several reasons and may have immediate negative consequences for the company and its investors, affecting stock prices and market perceptions. Understanding what happens when a stock is delisted from the S&P 500 is crucial for investors and stakeholders. Read on to better understand the reasons behind delisting, its impact, and how recent examples shed light on this aspect of the stock market. The S&P 500, short for Standard & Poor's 500, is one of the most widely followed stock market indexes in the world. It represents the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 is considered one of the main benchmarks of the U.S. stock market's health and performance. The index is host to many of the world's most important companies and household names, including the following (by market cap weight as of the fourth quarter of 2024): The S&P 500 has specific criteria for including companies in the index. While the choice by S&P 500 about inclusion is more than just specific measures, these are the main thresholds a company must meet: The S&P 500 is not simply a list of the 500 largest companies by market capitalization. The inclusion process involves careful consideration by the index committee. They meet quarterly to review which companies to add or drop. The committee also monitors for significant developments (such as mergers, bankruptcies, or restructuring) that might affect index composition. While meeting the inclusion criteria is necessary, it doesn't guarantee being included. The committee has discretion when adding new companies. When adding or removing companies, the committee aims to decrease index turnover while ensuring the index represents the large-cap U.S. equity market. The index's composition changes are typically announced with several days' notice. This allows index funds and other market participants time to prepare for the change. Companies can be removed from the S&P 500 for various reasons, which we can broadly categorize into voluntary and involuntary delistings: Some companies delist themselves from the S&P 500 or other major indexes. Reasons for voluntary delisting include the following: More commonly, companies are involuntarily removed from the S&P 500 because of failing to meet the index's criteria. Reasons can include the following: When a stock is removed from the S&P 500, it typically has significant effects on the stock and its investors. Short-Term Consequences: Long-Term Consequences: Companies that fall out of the S&P 500 can be included again. For example, Dell was in the S&P 500 before going private in 2013. The company was relisted in the index Sept. 23, 2024, to mark its 40th anniversary. Being added to the S&P 500 is often a significant achievement for a company. It brings several benefits, many of which are the opposite of being removed from the index: Here are several of the major companies removed from the index in 2024: Whirlpool, a major U.S. manufacturer of home appliances, was removed from the S&P 500 index in early 2024. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of American Airlines (AAL) from the S&P 500 in 2024 reflected broader challenges facing the airline industry and the company's specific financial struggles. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of Etsy Inc. (ETSY) from the S&P 500 was driven by changes in consumer behavior and ever more competition in ecommerce. Reasons for delisting: Effects: Other companies removed from the S&P 500 in 2024 include the following firms: As companies are moved out of the S&P 500 index, new companies are added to take their place. In 2024, the following were some of those added: You don't get your money back when a stock is removed from the index. You still own the same number of shares in the company. However, the value of those shares may decrease, and it may become more difficult to sell them. Index funds are mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. It provides investors with broad market exposure and typically offers lower fees than actively managed funds, as it simply mimics the composition of the chosen index rather than trying to outperform it. This depends on your investment strategy and the specific circumstances of the stock's removal. Stock prices are often negatively affected following its removal. In any case, it's important to reassess the company's fundamentals and prospects. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice if needed. Being delisted from the S&P 500 is a significant event for any company, often leading to immediate and negative consequences, such as a drop in stock price and reduced visibility. It can be voluntary because of a merger, going private, a falling market cap, or not meeting other index criteria. However, it's important to remember that delisting doesn't necessarily mean a company is doomed to fail. Some companies use this as a chance to restructure, refocus, and potentially return more robust than before. For investors, a stock's delisting from the S&P 500 should prompt a careful reassessment of the investment.

Title: Are Intel (INTC) Shares Worth Another Look?

Intel INTC shares have largely been disappointing in 2024, unable to fully join the semiconductor trade and down more than 50%. Quarterly results have added fuel to the fire sale, with the stock unable to find any meaningful traction post-earnings. Below is a chart illustrating the YTD performance of Intel shares relative to the S&P 500, with its quarterly releases illustrated by the circled arrows. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Given the steep decline from highs, could it finally be time to go on the offensive and pick up some shares? Let’s take a closer look. Currently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish earnings estimate revisions from analysts. Expectations for its current fiscal year have been notably negative, with the $0.27 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 85% over the last year. The negative revisions, caused by unfavorable quarterly results, bode poorly for near-term share performance. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Still, it’s worth noting that CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident, buying 12.5k shares at a total transaction value of roughly $250k in early August following the latest quarterly print. He noted that second-half trends are more challenging than anticipated but still expects the company to restrengthen its position in the market. Cost-cutting measures have also been a huge focus for the company over recent periods after margin pressures, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, Intel announced a $10 billion cost-savings target earlier in August. Please note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Investors should stay on the sidelines until positive earnings estimate revisions roll in, which would signal a meaningful change in sentiment. Earnings expectations for its upcoming release expected on October 24th have already been slashed, with the company now expected to post a loss of -$0.03 per share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar. It’s worth noting that INTC shares have been red-hot over the last month, gaining nearly 20%. While the positive price action has been inspiring, the bulk of the move has likely been fueled by a short squeeze following rumors of buyouts. For those seeking semiconductor exposure, there are many more positive stories, a list that obviously includes beloved AI-favorite Nvidia NVDA. Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook shifting higher across the board following unbelievable quarterly results. And concerning the top line, Nvidia’s sales are forecasted to more than double in its current fiscal year.

Title: Here is what analysts had to say after AMD's AI event

Investing.com -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) announced on Thursday that it will begin mass production of its new MI325X AI chip in Q4, as it looks to expand its footprint in a market dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). At an event in San Francisco, CEO Lisa Su said AMD's next-generation MI350 chips will launch in the second half of 2025, offering more memory and a new architecture designed to significantly boost performance compared to the MI300X and MI250X models. Despite the announcements aligning with previous disclosures, AMD shares dropped 4% as investors reacted to the lack of major cloud-computing customers. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares rose 1.6%, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell 1%. AMD confirmed that vendors, including Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), will start shipping the MI325X AI chip in early 2025. The chip uses the same architecture as the MI300X but introduces a new memory type to accelerate AI computations. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker aims to challenge Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture with the MI325X. In addition to the AI chips, AMD revealed new networking chips for data centers and three new laptop processors based on the Zen 5 architecture, optimized for AI tasks. The laptop chips will support Microsoft’s Copilot+ software. Su also stated that AMD will continue to rely on Taiwan’s TSMC for advanced chip manufacturing. Bernstein: “The stock sold off during and following the event in a typical sell-the-news response, perhaps understandable given some modest excitement into the day, lack of huge surprises, and MI325X performance specs that we believe were likely somewhat disappointing relative to NVIDIA’s impending Blackwell launch. While we don’t want to minimize things we didn’t really hear anything to suggest we should anticipate substantial upside to current expectations, and would rather own NVDA at this point in front of Blackwell.” Deutsche Bank: “We view the event as a successful continuation of AMD's impressive execution in delivering high-quality Data Center innovations. The increase in its Accelerator TAM from $400b in 2027 to $500b in 2028 suggests continued confidence in the strong growth and share gain opportunities in an important market.” “Overall, we continue to expect AMD's Data Center segment to be a strong growth driver in 2025 via both share gains in CPUs and the potential for a near doubling of Instinct revenue.” Bank of America: “New MI325X performance generally remains a full year behind NVDA’s latest Blackwell, with no near-term catalyst to change the dynamic. However, we highlight AMD’s multi-vector growth opportunities across data center CPUs and GPUs remain unchanged, with the current 5-7% AI accelerator share consensus outlook presenting a minimum $25bn+ opportunity by CY28E, and a bull-case scenario of 10% AI share over the long-term still on the table, given continued hardware, software stack, and networking improvements.” Truist Securities: “We see this as a product evolution rather than a revolution, which reinforced our longer-term concerns with the stock:(1) we see AMD's position in AI as likely confined vs. NVDA's (Buy) full-stack semis/hardware/software/services solutions, and (2) we expect the X86 market will slowly come under pressure from new CPU competitors. No change to our estimates or $156 PT. Hold.” Morgan Stanley: “AMD launched the new Zen 5 server architecture, the mid-life kicker for MI300, and previewed the MI350. The bull case that MI350 lands them in a leadership position is very compelling, but in the interim MI300 seems likely to drive less upside than we see elsewhere in AI.”

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares are rising in premarket trading after its results beat estimates; investors are watching wholesale inflation numbers following yesterday's CPI report; Tesla (TSLA) shares are sinking after unveiling its "Cybercab"; Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) reduces its stake in Bank of America (BAC) to below 10%; and shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are rebounding slightly after falling yesterday following an artificial intelligence (AI) event. Here's what investors need to know today. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are rising about 1.5% in premarket trading after the world's largest bank by market cap reported earnings per share (EPS) of $4.37 on revenue of $42.65 billion, above consensus estimates of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha of $3.97 and $40.85 billion, respectively. JPMorgan shares have gained more than 25% this year. After yesterday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation isn't falling as fast as some economists expected, investors will be closely watching another data point with today's 8:30 a.m. ET release of the wholesale-focused Producer Price Index (PPI). Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires projected that prices at the wholesale level will have increased by 0.1% in September from the prior month, down from a 0.2% rise in August. Tesla (TSLA) shares are dropping 6% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle maker unveiled several new products at an event yesterday, including its highly anticipated "Cybercab" robotaxi. Tesla also showed off a larger version of the autonomous vehicle called a "Robovan," as well as its Optimus humanoid robot. Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk said that the Cybercab would cost about $30,000 and be in production by 2026. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) continues to reduce its stake in Bank of America (BAC). According to a Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett sold more than 9.5 million shares of the bank's stock. The move lowers Berkshire's stake in Bank of America to less than 10%, meaning it will face fewer reporting requirements from the SEC. Shares of Bank of America are up about 2% in premarket trading. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are rebounding by about 1% in premarket trading after they fell about 4% in the prior session following an event to show off the chipmaker's next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. At the event, AMD unveiled its fifth-generation EPYC server processor, as well as its Instinct MI300X series Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chip and other technology. The lineup initially failed to excite investors who are eager to see the company take on Nvidia (NVDA).

Title: AMD Price Levels to Watch as Stock Tumbles After AI Chip Unveiling

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 4% on Thursday as the chipmaker's new AI lineup failed to excite investors who are eager to see the company take on Nvidia (NVDA). AMD's next-generation products, unveiled at its Advancing AI event today, come as demand for AI chips soars and AMD aims to expand its market share. Analysts said investors may have been looking for clearer signs of competition with AI investor darling Nvidia, an outlook boost, or a new customer announcement. AMD shares have gained 11% year-to-date (YTD) through Thursday’s close, trailing the S&P 500’s return by about half over the same period. The stock has lagged amid concerns that the chipmaker has failed to capitalize on the lucrative AI infrastructure boom. Below, we break down the technicals on AMD’s chart and identify important price levels investors should watch out for. Since a bearish engulfing pattern marked AMD’s all-time high (ATH) in early March, the chipmaker’s share price as oscillated within an orderly descending channel, a chart pattern consisting of parallel downward sloping trendlines indicating lower highs and lower lows. More recently, the stock has run into selling pressure around the channel’s upper trendline, with Thursday’s drop occurring on the heaviest trading volume since the early August sell-off, pointing to conviction behind the move lower. It’s also worth noting that although the stock remains above the 200-day moving average (MA), the indicator crossed above the 50-day MA in August to form a death cross—a chart signal predicting lower prices. Let’s take a look at three key lower price levels that could come into play if the chipmaker’s stock continues to undergo a retracement, and also use the chart to forecast an upside price target. The first area to eye sits around $162, not far below Thursday's closing price of $164.18. This is a location where the shares could attract buying interest near the 200-day MA and a trendline connecting a range of similar trading levels on the chart between February and October. If bulls fail to hold this level, the stock could fall to the $142 area, where it may find support from a horizontal line linking a period of consolidation in December last year with the prominent May trough. A deeper correction could see the shares revisit lower support around $122, a location on the chart where investors could look for buying opportunities near the channel’s lower trendline, which closely aligns with the early-August low and late-November 2023 peak. To forecast an upside price target above the descending channel, we can use the measuring principle. This chart technique works by calculating the distance between the pattern’s two trendlines and projecting that amount from the channel’s top trendline. In other words, we add $50 to $170, which forecasts an upside target of $220, slightly below the stock’s record high of $227.30.

Title: Nvidia, Mag 7 Flash Warning Signs For Stocks

The Fed surprised the market with an aggressive 50 bps cut recently, which has pushed the S&P 500 back to new all-time highs. However, not all markets are celebrating this move. Bond yields and mortgage rates, for example, have been in an uptrend since this decision, which is not normal to see at the onset of a rate cutting cycle. Also, the bull market leaders – the Mag 7 and AI focused semiconductors – are making a series of lower highs, not confirming this move in the S&P 500. This divergence between the market leaders and the broad market has been the consistent theme of the I/O Fund’s broad market reports in 2024. More times than not, the bull market leaders will lead on the way up, as well on the way down. So, when my firm sees the primary beneficiaries of a bull market start to make lower highs while the broad market makes higher highs, it tends to be a warning. Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang, left, talks about artifical intelligence with Meta's ... [+] chief Mark Zuckerberg at SIGGRAPH 2024, the premier conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques, Monday, July 29, 2024, in the Colorado Convention Center in downtown Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) In this report, my team will address the risks brewing in the market. The strange behavior in the bond market could be signaling that the FOMC has made a policy error. This coupled with key tech stocks trending lower against the S&P 500’s advance, has my firm cautious for the time being. In 2023 we saw these market leaders trending higher with the broad market. This was a powerful trend that lasted into late 2023. As a result, the collective Mag 7 returned around 90% in 2023 vs. the S&P 500 returning 24%. However, this trend is not continuing into 2024, as we are beginning to see cracks in market leadership. This year, the Mag 7 are up ~30% compared to the S&P 500’s ~20%. Though this year has been excellent for investors, it’s concerning the relative strength between the bull market leaders and the broad market is narrowing, which has been a constant theme in our broad market analysis throughout all of 2024. “When the cycle leaders start to underperform, it tends to mark the start of a trend change. The FAANGs have been the undoubted leaders of this bull run, and we are now seeing them start to trend lower against the indexes. More times than not, the leaders on the way up, tend to be the leaders on the way down.” More importantly, the Mag 7 is making a lower high, while the S&P 500 makes a higher high. In other words, the bull market leaders are not confirming this push higher in the broad market. This is a rare pattern that has only shown up one other time in this bull market – July of 2023, just before we saw an almost 11% correction in the broad market. A rare pattern observed in the bull market, similar to July 2023, preceding an 11% correction in the ... [+] broad market. This divergence is not only happening with the Mag 7, but it’s also happening with the most important sub-sector within tech due to AI – semiconductors. Since the current bull market began on October 13th of 2022, the Mag 7 has returned over 102% vs. the S&P 500’s 61%. During the same period, semiconductors have returned over 174%. The leading stock, Nvidia, is up over 967% over the same period. So, while the Mag 7 are the popular market leaders, the true market leaders of the current bull cycle are semiconductors, and specifically, Nvidia. This is a trend that the I/O Fund positioned for in 2022, making NVDA our largest position, as we rotated out of cloud stocks and into AI. Performance of the Mag 7, S&P 500, and semiconductors since October 13, 2022: The Mag 7 returned ... [+] over 102%, the S&P 500 returned 61%, and semiconductors returned over 174%, with Nvidia up over 967%. SMH has a history of leading market swings in the broad market. Since 2021, every time the S&P 500 made a new high without SMH, it preceded a period of volatility. Today’s divergence is one of the largest on record. The Semiconductor Index topped in July at $283, and is still well below this high, compared to the S&P 500 that just pushed to new a new high this week at 5796. Chart illustrating the semiconductor sub-sector’s corrective pattern, featuring a 3-wave drop since ... [+] June followed by a bounce from the August 5th low, suggesting a potential final drop targeting $190 to $165. When digging deeper into this key sub-sector, we can see that a clear corrective pattern is playing out. Since the June top, there is a clear 3 waves down. This has been followed, so far, by a symmetrical 3 wave bounce off the August 5th low. This pattern best fits a standard corrective patten. This implies that a final drop is still needed, which is targeting between $190 - $165. The advance seen today is poking above the downtrend line from the July top. However, this is happening on less volume and less momentum. Note the momentum indicator below the chart. It has given three lower highs while price provided three higher highs. This is a rare pattern that tends to precede a trend reversal. Chart depicting the current market advance above the July downtrend line, showing decreasing volume ... [+] and momentum. The momentum indicator reveals three lower highs, while the price shows three higher highs, suggesting a potential trend reversal. Nvidia topped in June at $140, and failed to make a new high in July with the rest of the Semiconductor Index. This was a warning that semis, and the broad market, were heading lower. This same relative weakness is still present today. While most semiconductors have broken out above their August high, NVDA remained below it. This week, it has moved above the August high, which appears to be the final move in this bounce which is happening on less momentum and less volume. This lines up with the I/O Fund’s game plan, which was to sell a quarter of our NVDA position in June around $129, and attempt to buy it lower in the coming months, which was discussed in detail on my recent interview. Chart illustrating NVDA’s incomplete corrective pattern, indicating potential drops below $114 and ... [+] $108, which could lead to a decline toward the $90 - $70 region, completing a multi-month correction. Like SMH, NVDA appears to be tracing an incomplete corrective pattern. A move below $114 and then $108 will signal that the stock is heading toward the $90 - $70 region, which would complete this multi-month correction. NVDA remains weaker than the broad market, as well as SMH. Considering the importance of this stock, as long as it remains below its June high, it is a warning to the current broad market advance. Some have argued that the market is taking gains in the AI leaders and spreading that money out into beaten down sectors. In other words, there is a healthy broadening out of the market, which typically exhibits strength. The narrative that supports this idea is that the FOMC just offered a surprise 50 bps rate cut into a seemingly healthy economy. The cheaper cost of borrowing should propel more economically sensitive sectors to play catch-up as the economic expansion continues. As plausible as this sounds, it’s just not showing up in data, yet. Since the Fed cut rates on September 18th, we are not seeing money flowing into your beaten down sectors that should do well if this narrative is playing out. Sectors like, transportation, small caps, retail sales, consumer discretionary and high beta are still under their 2021 highs. These are the sectors that would benefit from a soft-landing. As you can see below, aside from consumer discretionary, they are all underperforming the S&P 500. Chart illustrating the market dynamics where AI leaders are gaining, but beaten down sectors like ... [+] transportation, small caps, retail sales, consumer discretionary, and high beta are still lagging behind the S&P 500, showing no significant investment flow after the FOMC’s 50 bps rate cut. While Nvidia and Semiconductors are making a lower high, there is more money flowing into defensive and inflationary markets, like, Energy, Apple, Utilities and even the US dollar is doing better than the markets that would support the broadening out narrative. Another unusual development since the Fed cut rates is that bonds are not acting as they should at the onset of a rate cutting cycle. Historically, the relationship between long-dated bonds and the Fed cutting rates has been an inverse relationship. As the Fed cuts rates, it is usually in the face of a weakening economy. If prices are going down due to demand collapsing, then a fixed yield is desirable in that environment, meaning that we should see bonds going higher. This is not what is happening today. The day the Fed cut rates, the 10-year government bond began a sharp decline and is currently down nearly 4% from its high. This is a big move for the 10-year bond. Chart showing the 10-year government bond’s sharp decline after the Fed’s rate cut, highlighting an ... [+] unusual trend where bond prices typically rise in a weakening economy. The bond is down nearly 4% from its high. This is unusual behavior, as the above chart shows. Bonds should be going higher, not lower, based on historical comparisons. The popular narrative for this behavior in the bond market is that this is evidence that the FED accomplished a soft landing. If we were going into a slowing economy, which could lead to a deflationary event, then bonds would be catching a bid. So, the fact that we are not must mean that the economy is strong, and the economic expansion will only continue. This will then propel asset prices higher, as well as inflation, making the need for fixed yields a poor investment. As we just saw, the market is not buying this narrative, as money is not flowing into the sectors that would support this thesis. So, what could be going on? It’s important to understand that the Fed does not control the 10-year yield; this is controlled by the bond market’s expectations for future growth and inflation. The Fed’s reasoning for aggressively dropping rates on September 18th was that inflation is heading to 2% and the employment market is starting to show weakness. Since then, the ISM non-manufacturing PMI posted its hottest reading since February of 2023. Twelve out of the 18 segments of this report stated that prices are rising, not falling. Chart highlighting the ISM non-manufacturing PMI’s highest reading since February 2023, with 12 of ... [+] 18 segments reporting rising prices. Additionally, the labor market added 107,000 more jobs than expected, revising September figures up by 17,000, causing the unemployment rate to drop from 4.22% to 4.05%. This was accompanied with a labor market that is much stronger than expected. The most recent jobs report showed that the US added 107,000 more jobs than expected, while September’s report was revised higher by 17,000 jobs. This caused the unemployment rate to drop back to 4.05% from 4.22%. This is further confirmed with current mortgage rates. Everyone was expecting mortgage rates to drop with the Fed Funds Rate. However, since the cut, there has been a sharp increase in average mortgage rate from 6% to 6.32%. Current mortgage rates defy expectations, rising sharply from 6% to 6.32% following the Fed’s rate ... [+] cut, contrary to the anticipated decrease. The reason for this is because mortgage rates are not determined by the Fed. Instead, they are the result of an equation that includes the 10-year yield and the borrower’s credit score. So, the 10-year getting sold, means yields are going up. This happening on the day of the FED’s rate cut policy means the bond market is not convinced inflation is heading to 2%, which is pushing mortgage rates higher. This means that we could be getting signals that the FED made a policy error, and dropped rates too soon, as yields continue to climb in the weeks after this decision. Interesting enough, at the Grant’s Annual Fall Conference, Druckenmiller stated that his largest bet is shorting the US bond market. His reasoning is not because the Fed achieved a successful soft landing, which the consensus believes, but it is because “bipartisan fiscal recklessness is on the horizon.” In other words, the larger our deficits become, the more money will need to be borrowed to cover interest payments. As more and more debt gets created, yields will have to go up to attract more buyers, which will put pressure on fiscal budgets, and therefore creates a vicious cycle. To put this into perspective, the budget deficit for the fiscal year 2024 is going to come in around $1.9 Trillion, or 6.7% of GDP. There is no other year in US history where the budget deficient was this large outside of a major war, like WW I & WW II, or dealing with a major recession, like 2008. It is unheard of to have fiscal spending this high, in an expanding economy, with historically low unemployment. This makes you wonder what the deficit will look like in the face of a contraction. This was an issue that the market has been aware of for decades but was able to ignore due to historically low interest rates. With rates low and trending lower, this fiscal recklessness was allowed to go on. However, we are seeing for the first time in 30 years, bond yields are starting a new uptrend. Since 1981, the 10-year yield has been in a classic downtrend, making a series of lower highs. This trend made borrowing easier, as low rates made the cost of borrowing affordable. However, in 2021, yields broke this downtrend and made their first higher highs in 30 years. Today, yields are higher than they were in 2008, making the cost of borrowing higher than most investors are used to in over 20 years. Diagram illustrating the market’s awareness of excessive debt and low interest rates enabling fiscal ... [+] recklessness. Since 1981, the 10-year yield has followed a downtrend until breaking the trend in 2021, resulting in the highest borrowing costs seen in over 20 years. If this uptrend in yields continues, which looks likely, it would become problematic for inflation expectations, as well as the Fed’s ability to lower rates. It will also become problematic for the cost to service government debts, as more debt will be issued at higher rates to cover current service requirements. And, it will become problematic for stocks, specifically high beta stocks that need to borrow to fund operations, as estimates on future cash flows will have to account for a higher cost to borrow. In short, the last +20 years have built on the idea that inflation will not happen, and the FED can keep rates close to zero. The bull market pattern off the 2022 low has taken the shape of a messy diagonal pattern. This is a 5 wave pattern where the internal waves are 3 waves in all directions. It is also marked with large, overlapping swings. Note how wave 4 went into wave 1 territory – this is typical of diagonals. The 5th wave in this pattern is a blow off, and from what I can tell, we are in the final swing of this pattern. If SPX can breakout above 5825, then it can likely push into the 6000 – 6185 region. If instead, it breaks down below 5675 this will be your first indication of a potential trend change. Below 5500 and then 5115 will be the final confirmations. Chart illustrating a messy diagonal pattern in the bull market since the 2022 low, consisting of 5 ... [+] waves with overlapping swings. Key breakout points are at 5825, while downtrend confirmations are at 5675 and 5500, indicating potential trend changes. In conclusion, as the economic expansion continues, the odds of a recession remain low. However, money is not flowing into the beaten down sectors that would benefit from this reality. Instead, defensive and inflationary names are getting more flows than transportation, small caps, high beta and retail sales. The market leaders continue to make lower highs while the broad market pushes higher, and bonds are getting sold as if the FED stopped cutting rates, not started. The warning signs are high, and my firm remains defensive until these signals reverse, or the market corrects.
