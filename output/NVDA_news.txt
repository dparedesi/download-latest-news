Title: Five Critical Indicators To Gauge Recession Risk

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone , Contributor. The decline in stock prices combined with plunging consumer sentiment and uncertainty surrounding ... More tariffs has uncreased uncertainty about future economic growth. Since stock prices ultimately depend on earnings, the pace of economic growth is crucial input to future stock performance. After briefly hitting correction territory in the previous week, which is defined as a 10% decline from an earlier high, stocks had a modest rebound last week. The S&P 500 sits 7.6% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of 18.5% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks stems from an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high on Thursday, March 13, stocks officially entered a correction. In the twenty-one U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism regarding future returns. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After S&P 500 Correction The strong bond between avoiding recession and better returns following a stock correction makes monitoring the economy's health even more critical. Economists' consensus estimate of 2025 economic growth has dipped slightly to 2.2%, nowhere near recessionary levels. Unfortunately, economists have a poor track record of accurately predicting economic growth with enough lead time, and consensus estimates tend to lag behind real-time data. Consensus U.S. Economic Growth Forecasts Economic models attempting to forecast the current quarter of GDP growth were developed to address the challenges associated with consensus estimates. These estimates adapt to the most recent economic releases to predict growth. This methodology has its challenges but adds additional color to the economic backdrop. The Atlanta Fed model points to a contraction in economic activity in the first quarter, which is probably overstated because much of that downward estimate comes from a marked increase in imports to avoid future tariffs. The St. Louis Fed’s model remains in positive territory. The forecast difference between the two is vast for their first-quarter GDP estimate. After last week's Federal Reserve meeting, the committee noted that “uncertainty around the economy outlook has increased.” Estimated Frist-Quarter U.S. Economic Growth While accurately forecasting an economic downturn in advance with any accuracy is exceptionally challenging, monitoring some high-frequency data can help get an early warning about increased recession risks. These indicators were chosen because they are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available monthly, sometimes with a significant time lag. The labor market is probably the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. While initial claims are above the lows, the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or at a level consistent with economic woes. Initial Jobless Claims The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. This indicates that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find a new one. Remember that the number of employees in the U.S. has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren’t comparable. The bottom line is that the labor market is softening but has not yet reached recessionary levels. Continuing Claims The corporate bond market should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. Baa corporate bond data has a long history and arguably provides a look at the “typical” credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. While the spreads on Baa corporate debt are above recent lows, the increase seems insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) weekly. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, “Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.” The chart shows that these periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have often been associated with recession. Like the previous measures, financial conditions have worsened but remain below warning levels. Financial Conditions The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks has improved off its most recent lows and isn’t at the level seen before past recessions. Performance Of Cyclical Stocks The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is probably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also called yield curve inverting, a recession is coming. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which produced no subsequent economic recessions. The U.S. economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better prediction track record than the economists and is used in about every Federal Reserve model, so it is worth watching despite its warts. The curve is not currently inverted, so this model forecasts no recession. The Yield Curve & Recessions The economic calendar releases for the week are not of the highest importance. The two most notable are February durable goods orders on Wednesday and personal income and spending on Friday. Last week, the Federal Reserve left its projected rate cuts at two but increased the inflation and unemployment forecasts. In addition, the median forecast for GDP growth was lowered. Markets saw this as a somewhat dovish signal and pushed expectations closer to three cuts for 2025, with the first in June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Correctly forecasting a recession is challenging in the best of times, but the post-COVID period, with its irregular economic cycles, makes it even more perilous. These high-frequency indicators should provide a reasonable early warning system for a sizable economic contraction. Currently, the odds point to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. As always, there are no easy calls when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks or the economy, especially in a period of increased uncertainty around the severity of the tariffs. For example, though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if somehow this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies. There is always uncertainty, so investors should have a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses. This cushion can help moderate the impact of stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to withstand the inevitable stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership. Within the stock portion, focus should be paid to companies that can weather economic dislocations and perhaps even take advantage of them, regardless of their stock price movement.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he was wrong about quantum computing. But he might be right
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-quantum-computing-analyst-ai-1851771560
Time Published: 2025-03-21T15:45:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA+3.60%) chief executive Jensen Huang apologized for tanking quantum computing stocks earlier this year when he said the technology’s usefulness is still decades away — but one analyst says he’s actually right. During a Quantum Day session at the company’s annual GTC developer conference, Huang said he didn’t know there were publicly traded quantum computing companies when he made comments in January that led the stocks to fall by more than 40%. “My first reaction was, I didn’t know they were public,” Huang said in remarks reported by Bloomberg. “How can a quantum company be public?” Huang said the event, which included executives from several quantum firms as well as Amazon (AMZN+3.35%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.35%), was the first “in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,” according to CNBC. He added that “quantum computing has the potential and all of our hopes that it will deliver extraordinary impact,” but that “the technology is insanely complicated.” Despite the damage control, Huang “was right and all he did in January was point out the obvious fact that quantum computing is very unlikely to be a major economic force for another 15 years at least,” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note on Friday. Windsor pointed out that quantum computing stocks continued to fall by double-digits even after Huang’s positive comments on Thursday. Although Huang and other quantum executives made a clear case for the need for quantum — more processing power for cheaper — Windsor said the technology still faces setbacks. “[Q]uantum computers are only suited to doing certain types of tasks and when they are asked to do something else, all of the benefits that they offer evaporate leaving behind only the drawbacks,” Windsor said, adding that despite some current uses for scientific research, it will take years before going mainstream. Windsor addressed another problem with scalability and reliability. “Getting more than a few Qubits on a single chip, keeping the error rate down and making sure that the system is reliable remain huge issues and the industry is far from agreement on how these should be solved,” Windsor said. Google (GOOGL+2.12%), Microsoft, and Amazon have all recently unveiled quantum computing chip prototypes that they claim can solve challenges with qubits — or quantum bits used by quantum computers. Qubits are usually electrons, photons, or another subatomic particle that when connected together have far more processing power than binary 0s and 1s used by classical computers. But the different approaches are indicative of “how far the system has to go,” Windsor said, because there needs to be agreement before being able to reach economies of scale. “This does not mean that quantum is no good or that it won’t take over from silicon eventually,” Windsor said, “but it does mean that it is going to take much longer than anyone thinks.” Meanwhile, Windsor said, “the real problem” is that the publicly listed quantum companies “have absolutely no business being so.” These companies, Windsor said, will have “either gone bust or been purchased by larger companies like Google, Amazon or Microsoft” in the coming years. Nvidia’s quantum event and its investment in a Boston-based quantum research center are good signs for a company with a “history of being ridiculously early when it comes to technology,” Windsor said. But the company is “right” to focus its business more on AI than on quantum for now. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Nvidia (NVDA+3.60%) chief executive Jensen Huang tried to do damage control after his doubts about quantum computing tanked the stocks — but they fell again anyway. Despite Huang’s apology during the AI chipmaker’s Quantum Day on Thursday, shares of D-Wave Quantum (QBTS+3.77%), Rigetti Computing (RGTI+4.75%), Quantum Computing (QUBT+16.51%), and IonQ (IONQ+14.82%) all fell — some by double-digit percentages. At the market open on Friday, shares of Quantum Computing were down by about 10%, while Rigetti and D-Wave were down by more than 4% and IonQ was up by less than 1%. Later in the morning, some of the stocks were back on the rise, with IonQ up by more than 5%, D-Wave and Quantum Computing down by less than 1%, and Rigetti down by less than 2%. At the event, which was held during Nvidia’s annual GTC developers conference, Huang said that he didn’t know there were publicly traded quantum computing companies when he made comments in January that led the stocks to fall by more than 40%. “My first reaction was, I didn’t know they were public,” Huang said, in remarks reported by Bloomberg. “How can a quantum company be public?” During Nvidia’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, Huang said he thought “useful quantum computers” are still decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” Huang had added that he expects Nvidia will play “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, and push it toward getting “there as fast as possible.” “This is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,” Huang said Thursday, according to CNBC. Huang added that he thinks “quantum computing has the potential and all of our hopes that it will deliver extraordinary impact,” but that “the technology is insanely complicated.” Meanwhile, Quantum Computing reported fourth-quarter earnings results after the market close on Thursday showing that total revenue fell to $62,000, from $75,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023. “The increase in gross margin is primarily attributed to lower costs of goods sold in the 2024 period,” the company said. At the same time, the company’s operating expenses grew to $8.9 million, from $6.6 million the previous year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Stocks fell at the open as the shares of Nike (NKE-0.91%), FedEx (FDX+5.50%) and Micron declined after the companies’ earnings disappointed investors. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both fell about 0.8% as of 9:45 a.m, with the Dow Jones Industrial average shedding 405.6 points, or almost 1%. The shares of some Chinese electric-vehicle makers are falling after Nio’s (NIO-3.00%) net loss unexpectedly widened. Nio stock declined 5.1%, paced by declines of 2.2% in Xpeng (XPEV-2.13%) and of 1.5% in Li Auto (LI-0.89%). Tesla (TSLA+10.36%) gained 2.4%. Here are some stocks to watch on Friday: Carnival’s (CCL+2.32%) stock plunged 5.8% after the company posted earnings. While the results topped expectations, Wall Street Journal (NWSA+1.00%) columnist Spencer Jakab wrote that cruise lines are in good shape — but investors have been nervous about travel demand since Delta Air Lines (DAL+4.16%)’ cut its outlook. FedEx stock plunged 11% after it cut its full-year revenue and profit forecasts due to economic softening and uncertainty in the U.S., as well as severe weather. Micron’s (MU+2.30%) shares fell 7.6% after the company said that margins will miss analysts estimates this quarter, Bloomberg reported. The memory-chip maker’s earnings, released after the close yesterday, exceeded expectations for fiscal second-quarter revenue and profit on AI-related demand. Nike’s stock tumbled 8.8% after the shoemaker reported a tough quarter as it sought to pivot back toward its athletic origins while navigating increased tariffs on China-made goods and a softening U.S. consumer market. Its sales projection for the current period was much worse than expected. Nio’s ADRs fell 5.1% after the Chinese EV-maker’s net loss unexpectedly widened. The shares plunged 8.9% yesterday ahead of the results, and fell 8.8% in Hong Kong on Friday. Nvidia’s (NVDA+3.60%) shares slid 2.1% as its AI conference wraps up on Friday. CEO Jensen Huang said the chipmaker is partnering with quantum computing firms including Quantinuum and QuEra Computing to build a Boston-based research center that will integrate quantum computing with AI supercomputers.

At GTC 2025 in San Jose, Calif. today (Mar. 20), Nvidia (NVDA) hosted its first ever Quantum Day, an event to explore how quantum technology could impact industries. It featured a panel discussion led by CEO Jensen Huang, alongside executives from leading quantum computing companies like Atom Computing, D-Wave, Infleqtion, QuEra, IonQ, Pasqal and Quantinuum. Huang took the stage to clarify his statement in January that practical quantum computers were still 15 to 30 years away—which caused the stock prices of several quantum computing companies to plummet.

When stocks went down, I didn’t even realize these companies were public,” said Jensen. “Today, I am here to invite every quantum company CEO to prove me wrong. This panel is a therapy session for me,” he added jokingly. But more importantly, Huang announced that Nvidia is investing in a new Boston-based research facility to accelerate quantum computing innovations. The Nvidia Accelerated Quantum Research Center (NVAQC) will focus on integrating A.I. supercomputing with quantum systems, particularly emphasizing quantum error correction—a critical hurdle in making quantum computing practical. The new center will collaborate with Harvard’s Quantum Initiative and MIT’s Engineering Quantum Systems group and quantum companies including Quantinuum, Quantum Machines and QuEra Computing. Huang first welcomed Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, with a smile and a handshake. During the panel discussion, Baratz pointed to scientific applications where quantum computing is already playing a vital role. “There are problems in the world today that classical computing, or even A.I. alone, can’t solve,” said Baratz. “Think about accurate weather forecasting or drug discovery. Quantum computing can also help A.I. models become more power-efficient.” The panelists largely agreed that quantum technology has made major progress in recent months—but full-scale practicality is still in development. “We’ve achieved 99.5 percent accuracy in qubit fidelity,” said Subodh Kulkarni, CEO of Rigetti Computing. “But yes, [quantum computers] haven’t reached full practicality yet.” Qubits are fundamental units of data in quantum computers, that can exist in multiple states at once, enabling computers to process complex calculations more efficiently. For quantum computing to become truly practical and surpass the capabilities of classical computers or A.I., qubits must be scaled into the thousands, said Ben Bloom, CEO of Atom Computing. Meanwhile, Loïc Henriet, CEO of Pasqal, a Paris-based startup specializing in neutral atoms quantum computing, said his company is already set to deliver four to six fully functional quantum machines over the next few months to the French government and other clients. Unlike Microsoft and Google, which are actively developing quantum hardware, Nvidia has so far focused on software solutions. However, the chipmaker’s increasing involvement in quantum suggests it now sees the technology as a complement, not a competitor, to A.I. and classical computers. “Quantum computing will augment A.I. supercomputers to tackle some of the world’s most important problems, from drug discovery to materials development,” Huang said in a statement earlier this week. Huang closed the session with a challenge to the industry: quantum computing must prove its real-world value. He also urged realism in the industry’s expectations. “The quantum industry has to find markets where this technology delivers real impact,” he said. “We need to lower our expectations for the present and focus on how to build these systems for the greater good. It seems like next year we’re going to have some quantum demos at GTC.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer , Contributor. CHINA - 2024/06/23: In this photo illustration, the American healthcare business HCA Healthcare ... More (NYSE: HCA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an economic stock exchange index graph in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) One of the biggest losers from the Mag 7 during earnings season was Nvidia (NVDA). I called a top for NVDA back in August 2024 and am not surprised to see it fall precipitously after reporting excellent earnings. The narrative that valuation does not matter is being disproved before our very eyes – along with many other false narratives that have plagued our society. If you’ve been following my reports on the company’s stock, you would know that the recent drop in price is still not nearly enough to make the stock attractive. NVDA is not alone. Crowded trades and overvalued stocks are everywhere. Good stocks are harder and harder to find as the market was hitting new highs. Accordingly, I see opportunity in market pull backs. I see a golden era for stocks over the next couple of years as markets exorcise more false narratives (remember NFTs…haha) and embrace fundamentals again. Meanwhile, my firm’s proven-superior research continues to give an edge in finding good stocks. I work harder and smarter with my firm’s Robo-Analyst AI to scour the markets and the data to identify the stocks, ETFs and mutual funds with the best risk/reward. I previously made HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA) a Long Idea in June 2020, and have reiterated my bullish view on the stock many times. Since my original report, HCA has outperformed as a Long Idea by 137%, rising 224% while the S&P is up 87%. Even after outpacing the overall market, HCA Healthcare remains a strong business and very attractive stock. HCA Healthcare has steadily grown its top- and bottom-line since 2007. HCA Healthcare has grown revenue by 6% and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 8% compounded annually since 2007. See Figure 1. The company has improved its NOPAT margin from 10.2% in 2007 to 11.9% in 2024 while increasing invested capital turns from 1.32 to 1.48 over the same time. Rising operational and capital efficiency drive return on invested capital (ROIC) from 13% in 2007 to 18% in 2024. Figure 1: HCA Healthcare’s Revenue and NOPAT Since 2007 HCA Revenue & NOPAT 2007-2024 Year-over-year (YoY) in 2024, HCA Healthcare’s: Longer-term, the company has grown its admissions (general measure of inpatient volume) YoY in 8 out of the last 10 years. HCA Healthcare’s total admissions grew from 1.8 million in 2014 to 2.2 million in 2024, or 2% compounded annually. Over the same time, the company has expanded the number of hospitals it operates from 166 to 190. See Figure 2. Figure 2: HCA Healthcare’s Number of Admissions and Hospitals: 2014 – 2024 HCA Admissions & Hospitals 2014-2024 Hospital operators, such as HCA Healthcare, benefit from consistent, and long-term, tailwinds of an aging population and rising healthcare costs. In 2022, 17% of the U.S population was 65 years or older. That percentage is expected to increase to 22% by 2040. The population of those aged 85+ is also expected to double from 2022 to 2040. As populations age, healthcare spending increases. In fact, per capita healthcare spending for those aged 65-84 is 1.6x higher than those aged 45-64 and 3.1x higher than those aged 19-44. Rising spend from an aging population drives projections for continued growth in hospital spending. According to the Peterson KFF Health System Tracker, the annual hospital spending is expected to grow: With its industry leading position and superior profitability (more on that below), HCA Healthcare is well-positioned to capitalize on steady growth in healthcare spending for years to come. Since 2018, HCA Healthcare has paid $3.8 billion (5% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividends from $0.35/share in February 2018 to $0.72/share in March 2025. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 0.8% yield. HCA also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. From 2018 through 2024, the company repurchased $28.1 billion (34% of market cap) of shares. $16.9 billion of this repurchase activity occurred from 2022-2024. In January 2025, HCA Healthcare’s board of directors authorized a new $10 billion share repurchase program. Management noted in the 4Q24 earnings call that they “anticipate completing a significant portion in 2025.” Should the company repurchase shares at its 2024 rate, it would repurchase $6.0 billion of shares in 2025, which equals 7.3% of the current market cap. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 8.1%. HCA generates enough free cash flow (FCF) to cover both its share repurchases and regular dividend payments. From 2018 to 2024, HCA generated $30.9 billion in FCF while paying $3.8 billion in dividends and $28.1 billion in repurchases, for total capital return of $31.9 billion. I like companies that choose to return so much capital to shareholders instead of spending it on executive bonuses or acquisitions. See Figure 3. Figure 3: HCA Healthcare’s Free Cash Flow Vs. Cash Dividends Paid: 2018 Through 2024 HCA FCF and Dividends 2018-2024 HCA Healthcare has generated positive free cash flow (FCF) in every year of my model on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, the company has generated positive FCF in 46 of the past 52 quarters. Since 2018, HCA Healthcare generated $30.9 billion (23% of enterprise value) in FCF. See Figure 4. Figure 4: HCA Healthcare’s Cumulative FCF Since 2018 HCA Free Cash Flow 2018-2024 HCA Healthcare was the most profitable healthcare company amongst its peers when I originally wrote my Long Idea report, and it remains #1 today. It is also the largest hospital operator by revenue and number of locations. HCA Healthcare’s ROIC and invested capital turns are higher than all peers, while the company’s NOPAT margin surpasses all but one of its publicly traded competitors. Competitors in this analysis include Encompass Health (EHC), Tenet Healthcare (THC), Universal Health Services (UHS), and more, per Figure 5. Figure 5: HCA Healthcare’s Profitability Vs. Peers: Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) HCA Profitability vs Competitors Skilled labor in the healthcare industry remains in short supply. Job satisfaction for Registered Nurses (RN) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) remains low since COVID-19 due to increased levels of stress and excessive work hours. Many nurses also left the workforce after Covid. Worse yet, a significant segment of the nursing workforce is nearing retirement age, while too few new nurses are entering the workforce. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), nursing enrollment is not growing fast enough to meet the projected demand for RN and APRN services. Hiring enough labor continues to be a headwind for the whole healthcare industry, including HCA. However, the company is taking steps to recruit and retain quality employees. In the 4Q24 earnings call, management noted that employee engagement is “at an all-time high”, which has allowed the company to “reduce turnover and improve the capabilities of our facilities with having continuity and staffing…” Furthermore, the company continues to hire nurses from Galen College, one of the largest nursing schools in the U.S., in which HCA Healthcare acquired a majority stake in 2020. The cost of goods is rising, and the potential for newly administered tariffs to drive costs even higher remains a risk for many companies. In the 4Q24 earnings call, HCA Healthcare management noted that they’ve been working on tariff mitigation strategies for years to manage the cost of supplies needed to operate its hospitals. Importantly, management noted that in 2025, 70% of its supplies are already contracted with firm pricing, which could help mitigate any increased supply cost when and if mass tariffs are enacted. Importantly, HCA Healthcare is already priced as if tariffs and labor costs will hurt the business and result in deteriorating profitability. Management’s ability to mitigate these challenges creates increased upside in shares, as I’ll show below. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze expectations for different stock price scenarios for HCA. At its current price, HCA’s price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio is 1.0, which means the market expects its NOPAT to never grow from current levels. For context, HCA has grown its NOPAT by 8% compounded annually since 2014 and 7% compounded annually since 2007. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: the stock is worth $319/share today – nearly equal to the current stock price. For reference, the revenue growth in this scenario would be below consensus expectations of 5.7% growth in 2025 and 5.1% growth in 2026. In this scenario, HCA’s NOPAT grows just 1% compounded annually from 2025 – 2034, which is well below historical growth rates. If I instead assume: the stock is worth $435/share today – a 36% upside to the current price. In this scenario, HCA’s NOPAT would grow 4% compounded annually from 2025 to 2034. Should the company’s NOPAT grow more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside.

Economists, consumers, and business leaders are antsy. Wall Street analysts are bullish. Of the 12,320 analyst ratings on S&P 500 stocks, 55.7% of them are Buy ratings, according to a recent report from FactSet Research. If that holds through the end of the month, it will represent the highest month-end percentage of Buy ratings since August 2022. Another read: The share of Buy ratings is currently above its 5-year average (55%), according to FactSet, while the shares of Hold and Sell ratings are below their 5-year averages (39.1% and 5.9%, respectively). The S&P 500 fell into a correction last week amid growing concerns about the Trump administration’s tariff policies and the potential they’ll raise prices and slow economic growth. President Trump and his deputies have fueled the market’s anxiety by repeatedly acknowledging that tariffs might cause economic pain, but that they’ll go through with them anyway. Big tech stocks have been hit particularly hard this year: The Magnificent Seven, for example, fell into a correction weeks before the S&P 500. Yet they remain among the stocks analysts are the most bullish on. Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the S&P 500’s fourth, fifth, and sixth highest-rated stocks, respectively. Ninety-five percent of the analyst ratings on Microsoft and Amazon stocks are Buys, just slightly higher than Nvidia’s share (93%). Not a single Wall Street analyst recommends selling those stocks, according to FactSet's calculations. The tech sector is the second-highest rated sector—63% of ratings are Buys—bested only by energy, with 65%. Meanwhile consumer staples, a traditionally defensive sector that tends to outperform when investors expect a recession, has the lowest share of Buy ratings (41%). That discrepancy tracks with a recent report from Bank of America suggesting investors bought up cyclical stocks and sold defensives during last week’s sell-off.

Title: Nvidia bets on quantum computing with new Boston research center

Nvidia (NVDA+3.60%) is partnering with quantum computing companies Quantinuum, QuEra Computing, and more to build a Boston-based research center that will integrate quantum computing with AI supercomputers. The Nvidia Accelerated Research Quantum Center, or NVAQC for short, will strive to make large-scale, useful, accelerated quantum supercomputers. “Quantum computing will augment AI supercomputers to tackle some of the world’s most important problems, from drug discovery to materials development,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a press release. Major quantum companies will provide researchers from Harvard and MIT with “unprecedented access to the technologies and expertise needed to solve the challenges of useful quantum computing,” MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science William Oliver said in a prepared statement. The move might come as a surprise to some, considering the Nvidia chief’s comments voicing uncertainty in the near-term applicability of quantum computing mere months ago. Earlier this year, Huang made headlines and tanked quantum stocks with his assessment that useful quantum computers were at least 15 to 30 years away. But he seems to have regretted his words as he hosted a league of quantum computing executives on Thursday at the first “quantum day” as part of the company’s GPU tech conference (GTC). Huang started the panel on Thursday by apologizing for his comments, going on to say that this was “the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong.” It’s uncertain if investors are convinced, though: Quantum computing stocks IonQ (IONQ+14.82%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI+4.75%) ended the day down more than 9% on Thursday following the panel. The center will be operational later this year, but the “plumbing for this has been in place for a while,” according to Rajeeb Hazra, CEO of Quantinuum — a founding partner of the center and a privately held company born through a merger of U.S.-based Honeywell (HON+0.65%) quantum solutions and U.K.-based Cambrige Quantum. Quantinuum’s technology has been integrated with Nvidia’s open-source quantum development platform CUDA-Q since 2022, the same system that will be used at the research center. The center will be accelerating research in two areas, according to Hazra: making quantum computers better and more error resilient, and developing specific use-cases for these computers in fields such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and carbon sequestration technology. While he acknowledges that there is more work to be done, Hazra is more optimistic than Huang on the timeline for quantum-computing usability. “I think Jensen’s postulate was getting useful work out is a long time away. We disagree, because we are getting useful work out today, and particularly with the combination of classical and quantum computers,” Hazra said. Quantinuum says that the company’s trapped-ion quantum computers are doing work that cannot be simulated on classical computers as of 2024. “So by running a quantum computer, you are now generating unique data you could have never had before,” he said. Hazra also expects to use the center as a “premier test bed to accelerate” generative AI systems that use quantum computing. Hazra and a slew of other tech executives, like IBM (IBM+1.67%) CEO Arvind Krishna, are bullish about the potential for discovery that comes from “turbocharging AI with quantum data.” Quantum computers work on the subatomic level and are probabilistic models. They not only are significantly faster than classical computers in some circumstances, they also have the potential to go beyond already produced knowledge, to then give artificial intelligence agents insights about nature on a subatomic level.

Micron Technology (MU) reported quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates and issued a better-than-expected outlook, sending shares higher in extended trading Thursday. The memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner saw its fiscal second-quarter revenue jump 38% year-over-year to $8.05 billion, above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Adjusted earnings of $1.78 billion, or $1.56 per share, rose from $476 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier, also beating projections. The gains came as data center sales tripled year-over-year, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said, driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence. In the current quarter, Micron expects revenue of $8.6 billion to $9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 to $1.67. By comparison, analysts called for revenue of $8.53 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.51 per share. Micron shares surged over 5% in extended trading Thursday following the release. They've gained 22% in 2025 through the closing bell.

Title: Fewer NVIDIA AI GPUs Needed After DeepSeek, Says $600 Billion Chinese Tech Firm’s Strategy Head

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Despite mega cap US firms allocating billions of dollars in capital expenditure spending for AI GPUs, Chinese multinational technology firm Tencent's chief strategy officer James Mitchell believes that DeepSeek's AI breakthroughs demonstrate that such spending might not be needed. DeepSeek's claims of having developed its AI models similar in capabilities to some American counterparts but at a fraction of a cost appear to have permanently altered the stock market. Their biggest victim was NVIDIA's stock, which has yet to recover nearly $600 billion in losses during January's selloff. NVIDIA's GTC conference earlier this week failed to impress investors either, and the stock has remained flat despite CEO Jensen Huang pointing out multiple trillion dollar markets for his firm's products. In a recent talk, Tencent CSO James Mitchell shared that one use case his firm had for spending money on NVIDIA's AI GPUs was to train large language models or LLMs. Tencent released its Hunyuan Turbo S AI model a little over a month after DeepSeek's products gained popularity in January. The firm aimed at the Chinese startup with its products as it claimed that its model could respond to queries in less than a second. However, while competing with DeepSeek to develop the fastest AI models, Tencent also believes that the startup's training breakthroughs significantly reduce AI development costs. DeepSeek claims to have reduced AI development costs by using advanced software engineering, which allowed it to access a GPU's core functions. Typically, engineers rely on NVIDIA's CUDA software to use the chips, but the convenience comes at the expense of tighter control over the products. Commenting on capital spending for AI GPUs, Mitchell shared that "A second use of CapEx was GPUs for large language model training," This use case was important before DeepSeek shared its model development process. The Tencent CSO added that "there was a period of time last year when there was a belief that every new generation of large language model required an order of magnitude more GPUs." However, according to him, DeepSeek changed this perception, at least among Chinese firms. "That period of time ended with the breakthroughs that DeepSeek demonstrated," Mitchell said. While he didn't share how, Mitchell outlined that after the breakthroughs, "the industry and we within the industry are getting much higher productivity on a large language model training from existing GPUs without needing to add additional GPUs at the pace previously expected." Chinese firms are restricted from buying NVIDIA's latest AI GPUs, such as its Blackwell and Hopper products. The restrictions have forced them to rely on older chips or large GPU clusters to overcome the limitations of limited computing power. Tencent has claimed that its Turbo S model has beaten DeepSeek's products in math, reasoning and other AI capabilities. Industry sources believe Chinese firms are interested in working with Huawei and its Ascend AI chips as they navigate the chip blockade. Like NVIDIA, Huawei also offers its chip customers with software to control the chips. However, purportedly, DeepSeek has tested the software and found it lagging to NVIDIA's products. NVIDIA's shares, on the other hand, are yet to recover their pre-January selloff highs. The stock is down by 14% year-to-date as investors wait for more data for its demand to materialize.

Stocks changed direction and rose after existing-home sales unexpectedly picked up in February to an annualized rate of 4.26 million. Weekly jobless claims didn’t increase by as much as expected, and the Philadelphia Fed index dropped by less than estimated, to 12.5 in March from 18.1 last month. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all advanced. Here are some stocks to watch today: Accenture’s (ACN+0.82%) shares fell 9.8% after the consulting firm said the Trump Administration is delaying and canceling new contracts amid its push to cut government spending. Darden Restaurants’ (DRI+3.92%) stock jumped 6.9% as investors remained confident in the company’s prospects despite fiscal third-quarter numbers that missed expectations by some measures. Same-store sales growth of 0.7% fell short of the consensus estimate of 1.7%, as Olive Garden and LongHorn SteakHouse both missed expectations. FedEx (FDX+5.50%) stock gained about 0.5%. The delivery service is scheduled to report earnings after the close today. Both earnings per share and revenue are expected to increase year over year, according to a Zacks consensus estimate. Micron’s shares (MU+2.30%) gained 1.8%. The chipmaker is scheduled to report quarterly earnings after the market closes today, with analysts estimate that per-share earnings and revenue will be in the middle of the forecast range. Nike’s (NKE-0.91%) stock edged higher. The shoemaker is scheduled to publish quarterly earnings after the market closes today. Bank of America (BAC+1.12%) analysts said the results matter less than the company’s message about its product reset and evidence its new offerings are resonating with consumers. Nvidia (NVDA+3.60%) will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on chips and other electronics manufactured in the U.S. over the next four years, out of about $500 billion of total electronics procurement, CEO Jensen Huang told the FT. The stock gained 0.8%. QXO’s shares gained about 4% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the building products distributor had reached an agreement to buy Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN-0.02%) for $124.35 a share. Beacon gained 1.9% to $123.83. PDD Holdings’ ADRs gained 1.9% even after the Temu (PDD+1.83%) owner’s quarterly revenue missed expectations Tesla (TSLA+10.36%) swung between gains and losses after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recommended investors buy stock in Elon Musk’s EV-maker, saying in a Fox News interview on Wednesday evening that “it’ll never be this cheap again.” And an analyst has some advice for Musk. Zeekr’s (ZK) stock fell about 8.1% even after the Geely Auto EV unit reported fourth-quarter revenue that exceeded expectations as vehicle deliveries doubled year-over-year.

Pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election over four months ago, and since then, the period has been characterized by financial market turbulence and global uncertainties surrounding tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia. Bitcoin (BTC) has surged over 23% since the Nov. 5 election, reaching an all-time high of over $109K at the end of January. Despite a subsequent 30% decline from its peak, it remains one of the best-performing assets. Strategy (MSTR), often considered a bitcoin proxy, has gained 34%, recovering well under the Trump administration despite previously dropping around 60% from its November highs. Ethereum's ether token (ETH) has fallen by as much as 18%, alongside disappointing action in the broader crypto market. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining ETF has also struggled, dropping almost 30%. Meanwhile, investors have rotated money into BTC, pushing its dominance rate higher by 2% to over 61. European equities have done well, outshining their U.S. counterparts. The German DAX index is up 20%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 has gained 6%, alongside weaker performances in the U.S. stock market, where the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both down approximately 2%. A recent report from Bank of America highlights a record drop in U.S. stock allocations. Gold, benefiting from uncertainty, has continued to set new all-time highs, surpassing $3,030—an 11% increase. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar's strength against a basket of major currencies, remains flat. However, under Trump, the dollar has weakened significantly, providing some relief to risk assets and major currencies such as the Euro and the Great British Pound. Meanwhile, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has slightly declined to 4.2%, a key metric the administration is closely monitoring. Oil prices have plummeted by around 7% as the U.S. maintains its stance on energy dominance to reduce energy costs. Notably, some of the so-called "Magnificent 7" stocks have struggled, with NVIDIA (NVDA) down 16% and Tesla (TSLA) declining 6%. Recent losses on Wall Street and in the crypto market have ignited hopes for the "Trump put," or potential policy support. However, the administration appears willing to endure short-term pain for long-term benefits, believing that this approach will cleanse the markets of the fiscal spending excesses of the Biden era. This reset is expected to be characterized lower inflation, improved energy security, and a lower 10-year Treasury yield. "Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain—that’s the strategy," Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, said in an email to CoinDesk this week. "Regardless, I don't see BTC falling below 70k, possibly 73-78k which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think," Chen added.

Published: March 19, 2025 by Josh Melton, Zachary Jacobson, Jacob Kranzler, Niko Dyundev, David Rogers, Shiv Trisal, Mayank Tahilramani (NVIDIA) and Joel Caruso (NVIDIA) Share this post Keep up with us The NVIDIA Omniverse and Databricks Data Intelligence Platform integration combines synthetic data creation with enterprise AI capabilities in a simple-to-deploy, easy-to-maintain architecture. With NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator, Databricks users can leverage high-fidelity, physics-accurate simulations to parameterize synthetically generated data for vision model training. Training AI models for real-world applications require vast amounts of labeled data, which can be costly, time-consuming, and difficult to obtain at scale. Synthetic data generation in simulated environments offers a powerful alternative by enabling AI models to learn from physically accurate, controlled, and scalable virtual datasets before deployment. Leveraging Omniverse Replicator, a core extension of Isaac Sim, a reference robotic simulation application, with the Databricks’ Data Intelligence Platform provides an end-to-end workflow for developing domain-specific AI models in industries like manufacturing, logistics, healthcare diagnostics, and robotics. By combining synthetic data generation, automated AI workflows, and scalable cloud infrastructure, organizations can accelerate AI development while reducing data acquisition challenges and improving model accuracy. This blog explores the technical foundations of this integration, real-world applications, and demonstrates how the collaboration between Databricks and NVIDIA is supercharging machine vision applications. By fusing Databricks’ Data Intelligence Platform with NVIDIA’s unparalleled high-performance computing, enterprises can now build, train, and deploy vision models at speeds previously thought impossible. This blog explores the technical foundations of this integration and its real-world applications. The technical foundations of the integration start with a reference architecture that defines interfaces, data models, and communication protocols. Below is a generalized workflow that demonstrates the integration of applications developed with NVIDIA Omniverse and the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform to provide an end-to-end AI model training pipeline. The steps within the workflow are as follows: Within this architecture, Delta Lake is used as the integration layer between NVIDIA Omniverse and Databricks. We bridge the two platforms by leveraging a prototype, custom writer, which allows an application developed with Omniverse to write synthetic data directly into the Lakehouse. Using this approach, instead of writing the data to disk in the form of PNG and NumPy files, Omniverse powered applications can write the generated synthetic images and corresponding metadata into Delta Lake format. The files land directly into cloud storage and are registered to Unity Catalog where they are further processed using Databricks so they are available for downstream model training. The NVIDIA Omniverse and Databricks integration establishes a new paradigm for machine vision development encompassing synthetic data generation and easy-to-use, industrial-grade AI. Within manufacturing environments, defect detection models often encounter three primary challenges: identifying new defects, adapting to new products, and performing in diverse real-world environments. To tackle these challenges, the NVIDIA Omniverse platform enables customers to build custom synthetic generation pipelines. NVIDIA Omniverse enables developers to create entirely new camera angles, lighting conditions, and physical scenarios in their applications, significantly enhancing model robustness and adaptability beyond traditional methods, such as rotating or brightening images. By automating image generation, the synthetic data generation process becomes a tunable parameter within Databricks’ Managed MLflow. These adjustments can be made alongside traditional hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size. As you identify which variations impact model accuracy, you can refine your training approach to focus on the most effective combinations of synthetic data and hyperparameters while minimizing time spent on less productive configurations. By having synthetic data as a tunable parameter, new use cases are unlocked for manufacturers without disrupting actual operations: These approaches enable manufacturers to train a broader variety of machine vision models to solve business problems proactively. Rare defects with data that was previously too sparse to train on can now be augmented with numerous realistic examples, allowing businesses to catch defects before they escape while preparing enterprises for the new age of Data Intelligence. Siemens Healthineers, a joint healthcare customer of Databricks and NVIDIA inspired this integration architecture after experiencing challenges. The fragmented workflow—with one engineer generating synthetic data through an application developed with NVIDIA Omniverse on-premises and another moving that data to the cloud for ML training and deployment in Databricks—created delays. By implementing Databricks Unity Catalog to centralize all data, functions, and models under a single governance framework and directly integrating the Omniverse platform’s synthetic data generation capabilities, the organization dramatically reduced model iteration cycles "from weeks to days," improved data integration and traceability, and accelerated time to market.

Thousands of attendees packed into a hockey arena in San Jose, Calif. yesterday (March 18) to hear from Jensen Huang kick off Nvidia (NVDA)’s annual developer conference, GTC. Dubbed the “Super Bowl of A.I.” by the CEO, the event’s audience also included the grandchildren of Vera Rubin, a famed astronomer for whom Nvidia’s upcoming GPU architecture is named.

You can opt out anytime. Naming chips after prominent scientists has been a decades-long tradition at Nvidia. Following its upcoming Rubin GPUs, set for release in late 2026, the company plans to introduce a successor architecture named after theoretical physicist Richard Feynman, Huang revealed yesterday. The in-production Blackwell chip, unveiled at last year’s GTC, is named for mathematician David Blackwell. Since 1998, Nvidia has drawn naming inspiration from computer scientists, mathematicians, astronomers and physicists since 1998. These scientific figures are such a core part of Nvidia’s culture that their faces appear on employee-only company merchandise labeled with the names of Nvidia’s “heroes.” Early architectures took cues from icons like Nikola Tesla and Johannes Kepler, while more recent product lines have spotlighted women in science, including GPUs named after Vera Rubin, Grace Hopper and Ada Lovelace. Here’s a closer look at some of the scientists who have been honored by the chipmaking giant over the past few years: Contributions to quantum electrodynamics were among the many accomplishments of Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist who died in 1988 at age 69. He received the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for his efforts in the field. Feynman additionally worked on the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, during World War II. Most of the American public, however, first became aware of the scientist when he served on a presidential commission investigating the 1986 explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. Vera Rubin is most well-known for having provided evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe. Working alongside astronomer Kent Ford in the 1960s, the duo came across the discovery after studying more than 60 galaxies. A pioneering female astronomer, Rubin was the first woman to serve as scientist staffer at the Carnegie Institution’s Department of Terrestrial Magnetism and in 1993 was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. She died in 2016 at age 88. Nvidia’s sought-after Blackwell chips were inspired by David Blackwell, a mathematician and statistician who died in 2010 at age 91. In addition to groundbreaking contributions to game theory, probability theory and information theory, Blackwell penned one of the first-ever textbooks on Bayesian statistics in 1969. He also set milestones in the science community, becoming the first Black scholar to be admitted to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965. He was also the first Black professor to receive tenure at the University of California, Berkeley, and joined the school’s faculty in the 1950s. Nvidia’s Hopper chips, announced in 2022 and more commonly referred to as its H100 GPUs, took its name from computer scientist and naval officer Grace Hopper. She notably worked on Mark I, America’s first electromechanical computer, and the subsequent Mark II and Mark III computers during her time in the Navy. Appointed a Rear Admiral in the 1980s, she was the oldest officer on active duty when she retired in 1986. After leaving the Navy, Hopper worked for the Digital Equipment Corporation until her death in 1992 at age 85. She received the National Medal of Technology from President George Bush the year prior for her contributions to computer programming languages. When it came to naming its Ada architecture three years ago, Nvidia went back to the 19th-century to draw inspiration from the 1800s mathematician Ada Lovelace. The daughter of British poet Lord Byron, Lovelace—who died in 1843 at age 36—is often recognized as the world’s first computer programmer. Some of her most notable work occurred in 1843, when Lovelace added a set of notes to a translated academic article that laid out what many consider to be the first computer program. Her contributions were rediscovered in the late 1970s, leading the U.S. Department of Defense to name the Ada programming language after her.

Two chipmaking giants are joining forces. Yum! Brands (YUM-0.69%) has tapped Nvidia (NVDA+3.60%) to accelerate the use of AI across its global restaurant network. Joe Park, Yum chief digital and technology officer, said the goal of the partnership is to create easier experiences for customers and employees, and provide franchises with “better, faster, cheaper, and safer technology,” while maximizing shareholder returns. The collaboration will focus on three key areas for Yum: voice AI ordering for drive-thrus and call centers, computer vision to optimize operational efficiency, and restaurant intelligence, using AI-generated analytics to boost performance. Pilot programs for these technologies are already underway in select Taco Bell and Pizza Hut locations across the U.S., with plans for a broader rollout targeting 500 restaurants across all Yum brands in the second quarter. Yum also owns KFC and Habit Burger & Grill. Taco Bell has been exploring AI for several years. In July 2024, chief innovation officer Lawrence Kim said Yum had been testing AI voice technology for two years. By then, over 100 Taco Bell drive-thrus in 13 states had already implemented the technology. As the AI race intensifies among tech giants, restaurants are increasingly adopting the technology to stay competitive. AI has already become a mainstay in Big Food, with chains like McDonalds (MCD+0.06%), Chick-fil-A, and Wendy’s (WEN-2.11%) using it to streamline operations, reduce labor costs, and boost efficiency. Chick-fil-A is using robots to cut and squeeze lemons, while Wendy’s is using AI to help it manage Frosty demand. This partnership marks Nvidia’s first venture into the restaurant sector. It also signals a strategic shift for Yum, which has historically built its tech operations through acquisitions. By partnering with Nvidia, Yum will own the AI intelligence created, allowing it to customize the technology to its needs. Although the financial terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed, both Yum and Nvidia have seen stock growth, with Yum up 14% over the past year and Nvidia’s stock rising 35%.

Nvidia (NVDA+3.60%) unveiled more about its next artificial intelligence chips, humanoid robots, and AI supercomputers at its GPU Technology Conference on Tuesday — but some investors wanted more. The chipmaker’s stock fell by more than 3% after the annual developer conference, also known as the GTC. The stock reversed course during pre-market trading on Wednesday, and was up by 2.2% at the open. Later in the morning, Nvidia’s shares were up by 1.2%. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company’s Blackwell chips — which were announced at the last GTC — are now in full production after hitting snags last year. The next Blackwell Ultra NVL72 chips, which will have one-and-a-half times more memory and two times more bandwidth, will be used to accelerate building AI agents, physical AI, and reasoning models, Huang said during his keynote address. Blackwell Ultra will be available in the second half of this year. The chipmaker’s next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs will be released in the second half of next year, Huang said, followed by Rubin Ultra in the second half of 2027. Rubin Ultra will be four GPUs connected together on a single chip. The next AI chip architecture will be named Feynman, Huang said, and is slated for 2028. “The rate of innovation on all fronts continues to impress and suggests a growing moat versus peers,” Jefferies (JEF+4.23%) analysts said in a note on Wednesday. “However, the updated roadmap does suggest Rubin will only be an incremental update in 2026 with Rubin Ultra the more meaningful leap ahead in 2027.” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, shared similar sentiments in a Wednesday note saying that the Rubin launch “promises another big jump over Blackwell, but smaller than the jump Blackwell made over Hopper.” However, Windsor said the chipmaker “is showing no sign of slowing down meaning that it is quickly expanding into any area where AI will be relevant with the strategy to become the industry standard” before its competitors can start to catch up. While this will help Nvidia keep its market dominance, having more than 85% of market share for data center chips will keep it “a hostage to end demand,” leading to some “tough quarters when the inevitable correction comes,” Windsor said. He added that there are no signs of this yet, as AI-focused companies plan to continue spending tens of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure this year. Bank of America (BAC+1.12%) analysts maintained their “buy” rating for Nvidia, and said they are looking forward to Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra, which show “unmatched roadmap as Rubin advances AI performance 900x (scale-up FLOPs) over Hopper (Blackwell is 68x) in TCO optimized way,” in a note on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives said in a post-conference note on Tuesday that demand for Nvidia’s GPUs “remains extremely robust” and “is currently outstripping supply 15:1” as enterprises wait to receive their AI chips. “In essence, Nvidia’s chips remain the new oil or gold in this world for the tech ecosystem as there is only one chip in the world fueling this AI foundation ... and it’s Nvidia,” Wedbush said.

Stocks advanced on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate announcement at 2 p.m., which will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all rose modestly as of 10:52 a.m. — with the all the Magnificent 7 shares except Meta (META+3.52%) rising. The Fed will probably keep interest rates on hold, with investors focused on board members’ rate expectations — the so-called dot plot — and on the central bank’s revised economic forecasts, observers said. Powell’s comments will also be scrutinized. While the Fed governors are expected to keep the key rate at 4.5%, they may opt to pause — or signal a possible pause in May of — quantitative tightening (QT), the sale of financial assets from its balance sheet, economists said. The U.S. economy is definitely softening, but economists are divided as to the direction of inflation and policy, with some projecting three rate cuts starting as soon as the current meeting — which would be a surprise — and others seeing policymakers staying put for longer as prices remain sticky. Here are some stocks to watch today: Autodesk (ADSK+0.99%) stock gained 3.9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that activist investor Starboard Value plans to start a proxy fight at the design-software company. Boeing’s (BA+1.79%) stock jumped more than 6% after CFO Brian West gave upbeat remarks at the Bank of America Global Industrials Conference, saying the planemaker is on track with its key success factors for the year, according to a Bloomberg News report. General Mills (GIS-1.24%) stock fell 1.6% after the food company’s quarterly revenue fell short of expectations and it cut its sales forecast for the year. Gilead (GILD-0.39%) stock fell 3.8% after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering cutting spending on domestic HIV prevention. GSK’s (GSK-1.72%) U.S.-listed shares fell about 2%. Nvidia (NVDA+3.60%) stock gained 1%. The chipmaker’s AI conference in San Jose continues Wednesday. The keynote address Tuesday by CEO Jensen Huang failed to wow investors amid a tech-stock selldown, despite his announcement that the company will team up with GM (GM+2.85%) to build self-driving cars. Here’s a roundup from the speech. Tencent’s (TCEHY-0.64%) quarterly sales and profit both beat expectations and the Chinese internet giant announced increased investment in AI. The ADRs gained about 0.7%. Tesla (TSLA+10.36%) stock jumped 2.7% after it obtained a permit in California to operate a ride service and Cantor Fitzgerald — the firm formerly run by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — upgraded the shares to a buy. Elon Musk’s EV maker fell 5.3% on Tuesday after BYD (BYDDY+5.71%) unveiled an ultra-fast charger, amid growing signs that Chinese EV makers are motoring ahead. BYD’s ADRs advanced 1.8%, following the Hong Kong-listed shares higher. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The companies will evaluate potential solutions, including using AI to optimize the interconnection process, with the goal of enhancing the planning and modernization of energy infrastructure for a more sustainable future. The Next Generation of AI-Optimized InfrastructureBuilding on its commitment to provide customers with the most advanced AI infrastructure, Google Cloud will be one of the first companies to offer the latest instances of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs — NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 and NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition. Built on the groundbreaking Blackwell architecture introduced a year ago, Blackwell Ultra includes the NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 rack-scale solution and the NVIDIA HGX™ B300 NVL16 system. The GB300 NVL72 delivers 1.5x more AI performance than the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, as well as increases Blackwell’s revenue opportunity by 50x for AI factories, compared with those built with NVIDIA Hopper™. NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell is the ultimate universal GPU for both AI and visual computing workloads across healthcare, manufacturing, retail, live broadcast and other industries. With last month’s preview launches of its A4 and A4X virtual machines, Google Cloud became the first cloud provider to offer both NVIDIA B200- and GB200-based instances. Now, A4 is generally available — with A4X coming soon — so customers can take advantage of Blackwell’s powerful performance with the added benefits of Google Cloud’s AI Hypercomputer. Google Cloud and NVIDIA have worked together to optimize popular open-source frameworks like JAX, a popular Python library for machine learning, and MaxText to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs at scale. MaxText, an advanced framework for scaling large models across massive GPU clusters, uses optimizations codeveloped with NVIDIA to enable efficient training on tens of thousands of GPUs.

At its annual developer conference GTC in San Jose, Calif. today (Mar. 18), Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled two upcoming GPU architectures: Blackwell Ultra and Rubin. During his opening keynote, CEO Jensen Huang laid out the chipmaker’s ambitious vision to propel A.I. into an era of industrial-scale computing. Huang called GTC the “Super Bowl of A.I.”—with one key distinction: “At this Super Bowl, everyone wins,” he said. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Blackwell Ultra is expected to launch in the second half of 2025. Its successor, Rubin, is slated for late 2026, followed by the more advanced Rubin Ultra in 2027. Currently in production, Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra series is an advanced iteration of the Blackwell chips unveiled at last year’s GTC, which are 40 times more powerful than the previous-generation Hopper chips, Huang said. Blackwell Ultra will incorporate eight stacks of 12-Hi HBM4E memory, providing 288GB of onboard memory. The architecture will feature NVLink 72, an upgraded high-speed interconnect technology designed to facilitate communication between GPUs and CPUs—crucial for processing the massive datasets required for A.I. training and inference. “NVLink connects multiple GPUs, turning them into a single GPU,” Huang explained. “It addresses the scale-up problem by enabling massive parallel computing.” In addition, the company unveiled the Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition, engineered for enterprise workloads such as multimodal A.I. inference, immersive content creation and scientific computing. With 96GB of GDDR7 memory and support for multi-instance GPU technology, the RTX PRO 6000 is designed to power advanced A.I. development. Blackwell’s successor, Rubin, is named after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter in space. The initial version of the Rubin chip is expected to achieve 50 petaflops of speed during A.I. model execution. The more powerful Rubin Ultra can deliver up to 100 petaflops of performance, which Huang called a “major step forward” in A.I. processing and performance power. Early iterations of the Blackwell chips and racks reportedly faced overheating issues, leading some customers to reduce their orders. The newly introduced liquid-cooled Grace Blackwell 200 NVL72 system addresses these concerns, offering up to 30 times faster real-time inference for trillion-parameter large language models and up to four times faster training compared to Nvidia’s previous-generation H100 GPU. It can generate up to 12,000 tokens per second—the basic units processed by A.I. models—dramatically accelerating both training and inference. “If you want your A.I. to be smarter, it must generate more tokens. That requires massive bandwidth, floating-point operations and memory,” said Huang. He also explained that reasoning A.I. models such as DeepSeek’s R1 model require 20 times more tokens and 105 times more computing power. Nvidia is also collaborating closely with Taiwan’s TSMC to develop data packaging technologies for data centers, a move that could substantially enhance computational efficiency and thermal demands in future GPU generations. Huang also outlined Nvidia’s roadmap beyond Rubin. “The next generation of architectures after Rubin will be named Feynman,” he said, confirming that Feynman HBM is already in development and slated for release in 2028. Named after Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist known for his contributions to quantum mechanics, this upcoming architecture is expected to push A.I. performance to unprecedented levels. The announcements came on the heels of Nvidia’s better-than-expected first-quarter earnings results, driven by a surging demand for its GPUs. Despite increasing competition from rivals like AMD and geopolitical uncertainties including export restrictions on semiconductors, Nvidia currently dominates the global GPU market with an estimated 80 percent market share, according to a report by Nasdaq.
