Title: Billionaire With 30 Years of 30% CAGR Gains Dumped Nvidia, Palantir, and Eli Lilly

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Neilson Barnard / Getty Images Entertainment via Getty Images Very few investors can match Stanley Druckenmiller. He delivered an average annual return of over 30% over three decades at Duquesne Capital without a single losing year, but he does not own Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) today. We’ll look into why in a bit. Druckenmiller is a timeless icon who has done very well in the recent past, with his portfolio up 9.07% in just Q3 2025 alone. His current portfolio contains 62 holdings. You’d expect his top holdings to be the usual Mag 7, plus some AI stocks. After all, how can you perform well without investing in these stocks? Almost every hedge fund and ETF that tried to sidestep these stocks ended up lagging the market. Remember, Druckenmiller isn’t just any hedge fund manager. He has managed to do well with his top holdings being almost devoid of any AI software companies, with the only AI bet being Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Let’s take a look at his moves with these top AI companies he does not hold. Stanley Druckenmiller started adding Nvidia shares in late 2022, very early on after ChatGPT’s release. He bought in Q4 2022, Q1 2023, and Q2 2023. But starting in Q3 2023, he started shedding his NVDA stake. He sold for 5 straight quarters as NVDA stock climbed higher and higher. He sold his last NVDA share in Q3 2024, when NVDA stock reached nearly $135. The stock is at $178 today, so did Druckenmiller make a massive mistake? Likely not. His top 3 holdings today have done a lot better than Nvidia, and taking profits in 2024 and shifting into those were anything but a miscalculation. Druckenmiller likely identified that NVDA stock became too expensive for his liking and didn’t have comparable upside potential vs. the stocks he moved into. Druckenmiller has had an on-and-off relationship with Palantir. He sold over half his shares in Q3 2021, then bought in Q1 2022 and Q2 2022. Again, he sold for over a year straight from Q3 2022 to Q2 2023. He took a break from the stock before buying in Q1 2024, buying 770,000 shares before selling 94.6% of his shares (728,000) in Q3 2024. He sold whatever PLTR stock he had left in Q1 2025, presumably near the peak price of ~$120, as Palantir’s rally accelerated aggressively. PLTR stock has climbed up to $187.75 today. While he did miss out on Palantir’s gains since Q1, he took out big profits from Palantir and piled into what he saw as “safer” stocks with bigger upside. It would be out of order for an investor like Druckenmiller to pay an earnings multiple deep in the triple digits for PLTR stock. And this paid off. The top 3 stocks in his portfolio have all performed better than or equal to PLTR stock over the past 6 months. His biggest holding outperformed PLTR by over 2x, with the second-biggest holding outperforming it by nearly 3x (it is up 100% in the past 6 months). The third holding is essentially neck and neck with Palantir’s 35.8% performance. Druckenmiller has quite a long history with Eli Lilly, but we’ll be looking into transactions in the past 5 years. He bought for 3 straight quarters, in Q2 2022, Q3 2022, and Q4 2022. Druckenmiller then took profits for 6 straight quarters from Q1 2023 to Q2 2024 as he shed all his LLY stock holdings as the company did exceedingly well. He made a hefty profit doing so, only to re-enter in Q4 2024 as LLY stock dropped from the $900s range to the $700s range. Druckenmiller bought for 3 straight quarters but then ended up selling it all in Q3 2025, equalling a sale of 101,000 shares in total. Q3 had an average closing price of $744.53. LLY stock has since recovered and is at $1,054 as of this writing. Druckenmiller likely grew impatient with this drawn-out recovery and didn’t want to stay in the loop with the company, especially with the uncertainty surrounding drug prices as the government got involved. And again, while he missed out on gains on LLY, his top holdings have delivered much more. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: Amazon Set to Waste $10 Billion on OpenAI

Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 © megaflopp / Shutterstock.com Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) apparently cannot help itself. Media reports say it plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI. OpenAI, which until recently has been the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world, has raised money from a long list of investors. Some are venture capitalists who are simply writing checks to get returns. However, another list consists of money or strategic deals with Microsoft, Oracle, Softbank, Nvidia, and, soon, Disney. What these tech investors are getting is a stake in a company that has had its spot at the top of the industry challenged by Gemini 3. That is an Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) offering. It is also one that the company says will not make money until 2030, one that will need hundreds of billions of dollars to hit its ambiguous goals, and one that has a growing number of direct competitors. These competitors include divisions of public companies, well-funded xAI and Anthropic, and a legion of smaller companies. Bloomberg reports, “OpenAI is in initial discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. and use its chips, a potential win for the online retailer’s effort to broaden its AI industry presence and compete with Nvidia Corp.” Amazon is a tiny player in the AI chip business. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates, with a market cap of $4.33 trillion, which makes it the most valuable company in the world. Put plainly, the Amazon deal is part of the dangerous “round tripping” that goes on in the industry. One company invests in another. The company that gets the investment uses the money to buy products or services from the investor. Amazon clearly has little chance of competing head-to-head with Nvidia, so it is buying its way into the market. And Amazon can hardly say it is getting special treatment from OpenAI. The Financial Times reports, “OpenAI has already locked in $1.5tn in long-term deals with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom to supply chips and other computing infrastructure.” OpenAI does have one important strategic advantage in an Amazon deal. Like the rest of the AI world, it does not want to be trapped in a world where Nvidia is the only arms supplier. People have begun to ask whether the AI industry has created a valuation bubble. They are worried that the companies leading the race into AI will never make money. Many AI products are currently free. Investors worry that the data centers needed to run AI will take years to build and may not have enough electricity to run them. Still others believe that not all the large AI companies can survive in a brutally competitive market. The total of these investments will eventually move into the trillions of dollars. The Amazon deal with OpenAI is another example that the train has run off the rails.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs see $358M outflow: Are investors abandoning BTC?
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etfs-see-358m-outflow-are-investors-abandoning-btc
Time Published: 2025-12-16T22:26:55Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin price held above $85,000, but weakening spot ETF flows and year-end volatility tested near-term bullish sentiment. Key takeaways: Bitcoin ETF outflows and a 31% drawdown from the peak have raised doubts, but metrics indicate that institutional investors are not abandoning Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s shifting correlation with gold and steady volatility suggest price behavior remains intact despite the short-term market pressure. Bitcoin (BTC) gained 3% on Tuesday after selling off to the $85,000 level on Monday. An uptick in outflows from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds appears to show institutional investor demand softening since the Oct. 10 crash. This has tempered near-term upside expectations without signaling a broader shift in institutional positioning The spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $358 million in net outflows on Monday, marking the largest daily withdrawal in over three weeks. The move fueled speculation that institutional investors might be reducing their exposure after the psychological $90,000 support level was breached. More importantly, Bitcoin is currently trading 31% below its all-time high of $126,219, a pullback that could signal the end of the bullish phase that extended into October. According to X user forcethehabit, Bitcoin’s decline does not represent a trend change, as interest rate cuts have been delayed and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has reduced its balance sheet for longer than expected. The analysis also notes that institutional capital entered primarily through ETFs and corporate reserves, while rotation into riskier and more illiquid assets has yet to materialize. Bitcoin’s correlation with gold prices can be used to assess whether the cryptocurrency is viewed as an alternative store of value or simply a proxy for higher-risk assets. The digital gold narrative has been an important driver of Bitcoin’s upside throughout 2025. How Bitcoin tracks weekly moves in the gold price is more important than its 48% underperformance relative to gold since July. The 60-day correlation metric has oscillated between positive and negative since May, indicating little consistency between Bitcoin and gold price trends. Still, there is no doubt that Bitcoin traders are disappointed by the rejection that followed the loss of the $110,000 level. While such data may appear bearish at first glance, the 31% Bitcoin price drop since October had no impact on the correlation metric. This weakens the argument that institutional investors have shifted their risk perception. Bitcoin may still succeed as an independent and decentralized financial system, even as gold remains the world’s largest store of value, with an estimated $30 trillion market capitalization. It also seems premature to conclude that institutional money has abandoned Bitcoin based solely on a 10-week correction, especially since Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P 500 index by 7% over the past 18 months. Although that difference may appear modest, Bitcoin’s options risk profile closely matches Nvidia (NVDA US) and Broadcom (AVGO US), two of the world’s eight largest companies by market value. Bitcoin options’ implied volatility peaked at 53% in November, roughly in line with the current level for Tesla (TSLA US). When traders anticipate sharp price swings, this metric rises to reflect the higher premiums charged on call (buy) and put (sell) options. Market makers tend to reduce risk exposure when surprise price moves are more likely; however, this does not necessarily mean investors have turned bearish. There is currently no indication that institutional investors have abandoned expectations for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 in the near term. Correlation and volatility metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s price behavior has not materially changed following the 30% decline, meaning a few days of ETF net outflows should not be overemphasized. The effects of the recent liquidity injection from the US Fed have yet to be reflected in markets, making it premature to judge Bitcoin’s performance.

Professional money managers are feeling better about the stock market than they have in years. That may be cause for caution. The smart money is more bullish than at any time since July 2021, according to Bank of America’s December Global Fund Manager Survey, which showed optimism about the economic outlook at multi-year highs and cash levels at record lows. That may sound bullish—but the reading has pushed BofA’s "Bull & Bear Indicator" up to 7.9, a tenth of a point away from what the bank considers a "sell signal.” Why is that? The indicator is premised on the idea that market returns are driven by positioning, profit, and policy. The best time to buy risk assets, according to BofA, is when investor positioning is extremely bearish, profit expectations are recessionary, and policymakers are stimulating the economy—and the best time to exit is when positioning is bullish, profits are expected to skyrocketed, and policy is tightening. Investor sentiment is often a pivotal factor determining how the stock market responds to economic data, policy decisions, and corporate news. Excessive optimism can cause investors to overlook warning signs, while excessive pessimism can lead investors to overstate the significance of negative signals. Positioning is extremely bullish today, according to BofA. Fund managers' cash levels were at a record-low 3.3% when the survey was conducted between Dec. 5 and 11. Investors are more overweight stocks and commodities—a reflection of risk appetite—than any point since February 2022. Optimism about corporate profits is also running high. Nearly two-thirds of surveyed investors expect global earnings to increase over the next year, the largest share since August 2021. (A FactSet analysis estimates full-year 2025 earnings growth at above 12%, above the 10-year average.) Only 3% of those surveyed expect the global economy to fall into a recession over the next year. Policy, meanwhile, isn't looking too restrictive at present. Last week, a divided Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third time this year, electing to support a weakening labor market despite signs inflation is sticking above its 2% target. Labor market data released Tuesday could bolster arguments to continue cutting rates early next year. The tax bill signed into law by President Donald Trump in July is also expected to boost economic growth next year. The Bull & Bear Indicator has flashed “sell” 16 times since 2002. More often than not, the S&P 500 rises in the three months after a sell signal. But historically, pullbacks have been larger than advances, and the index posted an average three-month return of -1.4% during those 16 periods. The indicator has sent two sell signals this year, in July and October. Both came about a month before stretches of exceptional volatility, but neither foretold a prolonged slump. The S&P 500 rose 7.5% in the three months that followed July’s signal. Since the alarm went off in October, the index is up about 1%. Some other sentiment measures are flashing some concern, but don't appear overly dramatic. CNN's Fear & Greed index was recently in a neutral range, less bearish than in recent weeks. And the weekly AAII survey of individual investor sentiment has lately tipped bullish or neutral after recovering from more downbeat readings last month. The VIX, Wall Street's "fear gauge," remains in a zone generally denoting calm. Investors are increasingly concerned about the AI trade that’s defined the bull market of the past three years. Nearly 40% of investors said an AI bubble was the biggest risk facing markets next year. Nearly 20% said the biggest threat to stocks was a “disorderly rise in bond yields.” When asked what would be the most likely cause of distress in credit markets, nearly 30% of those surveyed said “AI hyperscaler capex,” the second-most common response. December’s survey marks the first time respondents have expressed any concern that AI spending could destabilize debt markets. Investor concerns about big tech’s massive spending on AI infrastructure have been a headwind for tech stocks in recent months. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is down about 4% since hitting a record high in late October. On Monday, one-time darlings of the AI trade, Nvidia (NVDA) and Oracle (ORCL), were trading about 15% and 40% below their respective all-time highs.

Title: CoreWeave collapse sparks fears of cracks in AI infrastructure boom
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/16/coreweave-collapse-sparks-fears-of-cracks-in-ai-infrastructure-boom

CoreWeave (CRWV) has seen its share price fall more than 60% from its June record amid growing concerns that the AI infrastructure boom may have peaked. New details reported Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal highlight how fragile the buildout has become as operational delays collide with heavy leverage and tightening credit conditions. Investors are increasingly focused on two core risks with CRWV, according to the story. First, the company relies heavily on high interest debt to finance purchases of advanced AI chips from NVIDIA (NVDA). Second, the company depends on a small number of large customers, including OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), for the majority of its revenue. Some of CoreWeave’s problems stemmed from a basic construction setback, the story continued. Heavy rainstorms in North Texas delayed concrete pours at a major data center site, pushing back delivery timelines for computing capacity. Which shows even routine infrastructure bottlenecks can disrupt trillion dollar AI investment plans. Investor confidence weakened further in late October when CoreWeave’s proposed $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific collapsed. Core Scientific (CORZ), a former bitcoin miner turned data center landlord, rejected the deal after shareholders warned it would expose them to CoreWeave’s volatile share price and leveraged balance sheet. Shares of Oracle (ORCL) and Broadcom (AVGO) have fallen by double digit percentages in the past week after recent third quarter earnings, both companies flagging slower timing for AI related spending. The crypto and AI mining spillover has occurred as a result of new diversified revenues for bitcoin miners. IREN (IREN) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) have pivoted toward AI focused on high performance computing, signing customers including Microsoft. Each had previously surged over 500% this year, but both are down about 50% in recent weeks.. Another cause for concern, meanwhile, is that the bitcoin mining sector is increasingly relying on debt to fund expansion. CoreWeave shares have fallen a further 4% on Tuesday, trading below $70 for the first time since May.

Title: Crypto asset manager Bitwise says bitcoin will break its four-year cycle in 2026

Full Content:
Bitwise is telling clients to brace for a different kind of bitcoin BTC$86,817.46 market in 2026, arguing that the asset is maturing just as institutional money ramps up. The crypto asset manager said bitcoin’s long-watched four-year cycle is breaking down as halvings matter less, rates are expected to fall and leverage has been reined in after major liquidations in late 2025. "The forces that previously drove four-year cycles–the bitcoin halving, interest rate cycles, and crypto’s leverage-fueled booms and busts—are significantly weaker than they’ve been in past cycles," Matt Hougan, Bitwise CIO, said in the Monday blog post. The quadrennial halving slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply by 50% by reducing the amount of new BTC miners receive as a reward for producing blocks. Combined with spot bitcoin ETF-fueled inflows and easier access on big brokerage platforms, Hougan expects those forces to help drive bitcoin to new all-time highs next year instead of a classic post-halving bust. Hougan also argued that bitcoin is no longer the outlier on risk many investors assume, noting that it has been less volatile than shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) in 2025 and that its swings have been trending lower for a decade as exchange-traded funds broaden ownership. At the same time, Hougan forecasts bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. stocks will fall as crypto-specific catalysts, regulation, adoption and product innovation take the wheel. Put together, Bitwise says, those trends could make 2026 a breakout year for bitcoin as a portfolio asset and pull in tens of billions of dollars in new institutional capital.

Title: This Analyst Sees Nvidia at $8.5 Trillion Next Year. Is It Even Possible?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © alengo / E+ via Getty Images Analyst price targets on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock were initially all over the place. The rally has continued for over 3 years, with both revenue still growing at breakneck speeds. Some analysts are now making bolder moves and are starting to coalesce near even more ambitious targets. The highest such recent price target projects NVDA stock at $352 next year. This implies a massive 101% leap from here and comes from Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis. This analyst has an excellent history of making winning calls, with 69% of his ratings being successful, with an average return per rating of 28.3% over the past year. This is exceptionally good, and puts him at #32 out of over 10,000 tracked Wall Street analysts. Should you take this rating seriously? Let’s take a look. On November 20, Lipacis lifted his price target on NVDA stock from $261 to $352. He used the company’s inventory buildup “to support large orders” as his rationale for the price target increase. This may look counterintuitive at first, as a bigger inventory usually means products are not being sold. However, the rising inventory is viewed bullishly because Nvidia itself has said they’re building up to meet unprecedented AI compute demand, not excess supply. Their backlog for 2025 and 2026 is at $500 billion, with the company’s CFO saying that even this is tentative and could be an underestimate due to constant demand from hyperscalers. Lipacis believes revenue growth could accelerate to 79% by mid-2026. If this happens, Wall Street is likely to slap a higher premium on NVDA stock. The current forward price-earnings ratio of 23 times makes NVDA stock cheaper than Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) at 33 times and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at 63 times. Nvidia’s competitors have failed to make ground. Many other AI chipmakers have cost-effective products, but they pale in comparison to what Nvidia has to offer. Nvidia essentially has the AI chip market locked inside its walled garden. It is very difficult and expensive for any major hyperscaler to switch from Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem to another one. Nvidia has been making it even harder with the recent CUDA tiles update that will get developers even more hooked. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek tried training its upcoming model with Huawei’s AI chips but failed. It reportedly ended up reverting to Nvidia’s chips. This failure likely cost DeepSeek the momentum it built up earlier this year with its R1 model. Other AI companies are unlikely to start tinkering around with their AI chip suppliers at scale, since a failure that sets back a company just a few months could cost them dearly. All of this means that Nvidia is unlikely to give up its lead anytime soon. It’s going exceedingly well for Nvidia, but the rally won’t go on forever. Even if Nvidia has a large lead in the market, the ongoing “AI revolution” will dictate what happens to NVDA stock. If the buildout continues for years and years, Nvidia will climb along with it. That seems to be what Lipacis is betting on. At the same time, hyperscalers don’t have infinite cash to throw at AI chips. Companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are making headway with their own AI chips to use in-house and avoid the margins on Nvidia’s chips. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is not a hyperscaler, but the AI spending has already evaporated its net cash position, and it is now in net debt. Nvidia could either end up like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and trade sideways or Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), where it gives up almost all of its gains once this AI buildout ends. Only time will tell, so it’s still a good idea to keep around 10-15% of your portfolio in NVDA. If you are already at that level, I wouldn’t snap up more unless you get a bigger discount.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chaay_Tee / iStock via Getty Images Futures are trading higher on Monday as we head into the final trading weeks of 2025. All of the major indices were hit hard on Friday as investors began a big rotation last week out of the AI stocks that have led the market higher since ChatGPT was introduced over three years ago. The miss by Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) seems like the final straw for many, as the Magnificent 7 have started to wobble in 2025, with only NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) beating the S&P 500 this year. The NASDAQ took the biggest hit on Friday, closing down a whopping 1.69% at 23,195. The Dow Jones Industrials, which had been having a solid week until Friday, closed at 48,458, down 0.51%, while the S&P 500 was last seen at 6827, down 1.07%. Investors can likely expect more volatility as we head to the end of the year, and trading volume starts to fade. Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve on Friday, with investors buying some of the shorter maturities while sellers were active in the mid-to long-dated bonds. Traders pointed to a steeper curve as the market reacted to the Fed’s rate cut decision and digested economic data signaling a strong labor market, pushing yields higher despite expectations of future rate cuts. The 30-year long bond closed trading on Friday at 4.85% while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.19%. Prices were lower across the energy complex on Friday, primarily due to ongoing concerns about a global oil and gas supply surplus, a broad market sell-off driven by anxiety over the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, and rising U.S. Treasury yields. Both major benchmarks were lower on the day, with Brent Crude falling 0.26% to finish at $61.12, while West Texas Intermediate closed at $57.44, down 0.28%. Despite yet another Canadian polar vortex dropping temperatures over much of the United States, Natural gas closed at $4.11 down 2.79% after recently trading as high as $5. Gold was once again the winner on Friday, closing at $4,298, continuing a run that has been one of the top stories for 2025. The bullion continued its strong move, primarily due to expectations of more U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2026, which makes non-yielding gold more attractive. Add persistent geopolitical risks and a weaker dollar, even as the Fed’s rate-hiking cycle paused, amid data showing cooling labor markets. Traders are pricing in more rate cuts for 2026, and a dovish Fed outlook, alongside safe-haven demand, continues to support gold and silver prices. Cryptocurrency trading on Friday saw Bitcoin (BTC) bounce back above $92,000 after initial dips, influenced by the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts as traders absorbed the potential for a loosened monetary policy in 2026, while Ethereum (ETH) also posted gains. However, the market displayed mixed signals and indecision between bullish potential and lingering overhead resistance. The gains were surrendered over the weekend, and as of 8 am EST on Monday, Bitcoin was quoted at $89,530. Ethereum was trading at $3,141. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Title: NVIDIA Debuts Nemotron 3 Family of Open Models
URL: https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-debuts-nemotron-3-family-of-open-models
Time Published: 2025-12-15T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
News Summary: NVIDIA today announced the NVIDIA Nemotron™ 3 family of open models, data and libraries designed to power transparent, efficient and specialized agentic AI development across industries. The Nemotron 3 models — with Nano, Super and Ultra sizes — introduce a breakthrough hybrid latent mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture that helps developers build and deploy reliable multi-agent systems at scale. As organizations shift from single-model chatbots to collaborative multi-agent AI systems, developers face mounting challenges, including communication overhead, context drift and high inference costs. In addition, developers require transparency to trust the models that will automate their complex workflows. Nemotron 3 directly addresses these challenges, delivering the performance and openness customers need to build specialized, agentic AI. “Open innovation is the foundation of AI progress,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With Nemotron, we’re transforming advanced AI into an open platform that gives developers the transparency and efficiency they need to build agentic systems at scale.” NVIDIA Nemotron supports NVIDIA’s broader sovereign AI efforts, with organizations from Europe to South Korea adopting open, transparent and efficient models that allow them to build AI systems aligned to their own data, regulations and values. Early adopters, including Accenture, Cadence, CrowdStrike, Cursor, Deloitte, EY, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Palantir, Perplexity, ServiceNow, Siemens, Synopsys and Zoom, are integrating models from the Nemotron family to power AI workflows across manufacturing, cybersecurity, software development, media, communications and other industries. “NVIDIA and ServiceNow have been shaping the future of AI for years, and the best is yet to come,” Bill McDermott, chairman and CEO of ServiceNow. “Today, we’re taking a major step forward in empowering leaders across all industries to fast-track their agentic AI strategy. ServiceNow’s intelligent workflow automation combined with NVIDIA Nemotron 3 will continue to define the standard with unmatched efficiency, speed and accuracy.” As multi-agent AI systems expand, developers are increasingly relying on proprietary models for state-of-the-art reasoning while using more efficient and customizable open models to drive down costs. Routing tasks between frontier-level models and Nemotron in a single workflow gives agents the most intelligence while optimizing tokenomics. "Perplexity is built on the idea that human curiosity will be amplified by accurate AI built into exceptional tools, like AI assistants," said Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity. “With our agent router, we can direct workloads to the best fine-tuned open models, like Nemotron 3 Ultra, or leverage leading proprietary models when tasks benefit from their unique capabilities — ensuring our AI assistants operate with exceptional speed, efficiency and scale.” The open Nemotron 3 models enable startups to build and iterate faster on AI agents and accelerate innovation from prototype to enterprise deployment. General Catalyst, Mayfield and Sierra Ventures’ portfolio companies are exploring Nemotron 3 to build AI teammates that support human-AI collaboration. “NVIDIA’s open model stack and the NVIDIA Inception program give early-stage companies the models, tools and a cost-effective infrastructure to experiment, differentiate and scale fast,” said Navin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield. “Nemotron 3 gives founders a running start on building agentic AI applications and AI teammates, and helps them tap into NVIDIA’s massive installed base.” Nemotron 3 Reinvents Multi-Agent AI With Efficiency and Accuracy The Nemotron 3 family of MoE models includes three sizes: Available today, Nemotron 3 Nano is the most compute-cost-efficient model, optimized for tasks such as software debugging, content summarization, AI assistant workflows and information retrieval at low inference costs. The model uses a unique hybrid MoE architecture to deliver gains in efficiency and scalability. This design achieves up to 4x higher token throughput compared with Nemotron 2 Nano and reduces reasoning-token generation by up to 60%, significantly lowering inference costs. With a 1-million-token context window, Nemotron 3 Nano remembers more, making it more accurate and better capable of connecting information over long, multistep tasks. Artificial Analysis, an independent organization that benchmarks AI, ranked the model as the most open and efficient among models of the same size, with leading accuracy. Nemotron 3 Super excels at applications that require many collaborating agents to achieve complex tasks with low latency. Nemotron 3 Ultra serves as an advanced reasoning engine for AI workflows that demand deep research and strategic planning. Nemotron 3 Super and Ultra use NVIDIA’s ultraefficient 4-bit NVFP4 training format on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, significantly cutting memory requirements and speeding up training. This efficiency allows larger models to be trained on existing infrastructure without compromising accuracy relative to higher-precision formats. With the Nemotron 3 family of models, developers can choose the open model that is right-sized for their specific workloads, scaling from dozens to hundreds of agents while benefiting from faster, more accurate long-horizon reasoning for complex workflows. New Open Tools and Data for AI Agent Customization NVIDIA also released a collection of training datasets and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning libraries available to anyone building specialized AI agents. Three trillion tokens of new Nemotron pretraining, post-training and reinforcement learning datasets supply the rich reasoning, coding and multistep workflow examples needed to create highly capable, domain-specialized agents. The Nemotron Agentic Safety Dataset provides real-world telemetry to help teams evaluate and strengthen the safety of complex agent systems. To accelerate development, NVIDIA released the NeMo Gym and NeMo RL open-source libraries, which provide the training environments and post-training foundation for Nemotron models, along with NeMo Evaluator to validate model safety and performance. All tools and datasets are now available on GitHub and Hugging Face. Nemotron 3 is supported by LM Studio, llama.cpp, SGLang and vLLM. In addition, Prime Intellect and Unsloth are integrating NeMo Gym’s ready-to-use training environments directly into their workflows, giving teams faster, easier access to powerful reinforcement learning training. Get Started With NVIDIA Open Models Nemotron 3 Nano is available today on Hugging Face and through inference service providers including Baseten, DeepInfra, Fireworks, FriendliAI, OpenRouter and Together AI. Nemotron is offered on enterprise AI and data infrastructure platforms, including Couchbase, DataRobot, H2O.ai, JFrog, Lambda and UiPath. For customers on public clouds, Nemotron 3 Nano will be available on AWS via Amazon Bedrock (serverless) as well as supported on Google Cloud, CoreWeave, Crusoe, Microsoft Foundry, Nebius, Nscale and Yotta soon. Nemotron 3 Nano is available as an NVIDIA NIM™ microservice for secure, scalable deployment anywhere on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure for maximum privacy and control. Nemotron 3 Super and Ultra are expected to be available in the first half of 2026. About NVIDIA NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in AI and accelerated computing.

There’s no bulletproof way to identify an investment bubble before it happens, or even while it’s happening. We can only pinpoint bubbles in hindsight, after they’ve already burst — and lost a lot of investors a lot of money. But when people look back on bubbles of the past, like the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s or the housing bubble of the mid 2000s, many recall a vague feeling that something was off. It’s no secret that many experts have that feeling right now about the current AI boom. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the head of the world’s most prominent AI lab, has sounded the alarm. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” Altman said in an August interview with The Verge. Should you make investment decisions based on those kinds of feelings and opinions? I don’t know. I’m just a guy who writes personal finance articles. I don’t have any groundbreaking insights that conclusively prove that we are or aren’t in an AI bubble. But I did ask financial economists at more than a dozen universities across the United States about it, and their responses were striking: More than 75% of economists we spoke to think the current AI investment boom is, in fact, a bubble. Most of these economists, who hold positions at prominent universities, gave their answers on condition of anonymity, given the sensitive nature of the topic, but they cited a variety of evidence for their positions. Below, we’re breaking down the arguments for and against the theory that we’re in an AI bubble — and discussing how you can protect yourself if that theory turns out to be true. Brokerage firms I’ll start by looking at the “not a bubble” and “maybe a bubble” responses. These were far fewer in number than the “yes” responses from economists, but they brought up an important point: There is real money in AI, and several of the biggest tech stocks are proving that with their earnings and revenue. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Nvidia (NVDA) reported a record $57 billion in revenue and $1.30 in earnings per share, giving it a price-to-earnings ratio (PE ratio) in the mid-40s range. Microsoft (MSFT) reported $77.7 billion in revenue and $3.72 in earnings per share in its most recent quarterly report, giving it a PE ratio in the mid-30s. Alphabet (GOOG) reported $102.3 billion in quarterly revenue and earnings per share of $2.87, giving it a PE ratio in the low 30s. These PE ratios are a little high — a “normal” PE ratio is typically somewhere in the 20s — but they’re not outrageous. All three stocks have actually seen decreases in PE ratio in recent years. Plus, there are plenty of non-AI stocks in much worse shape in terms of PE ratio. For example, CVS Health Corp. (CVS) has a PE ratio over 200. » See our list of the most undervalued stocks in the S&P 500 There are questions about many of the other big AI stocks. Tesla (TSLA) has a PE ratio over 300, and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) has a PE ratio over 400, for example. And there are also questions about whether Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet et al would still be able to rake in tens of billions of dollars in AI revenue in the event of a broad downturn in AI investment. But for the time being, it’s actually kind of hard to make an argument that the multi-trillion-dollar AI behemoths like Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet are severely overvalued. They have the earnings to back up their stock prices, to some extent. That said, 10 out of 13 economists surveyed by NerdWallet did ultimately say that we’re in a bubble. Here are some of the arguments they made for that position: Valuations are on the high end. The PE ratios of the biggest tech stocks, like Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, might not be obscene, but they’re a little higher than what most would consider a typical PE ratio, and many other AI stocks have triple-digit PE ratios. Venture capital investment in AI startups is growing at a wild rate. It’s worth remembering that the stock market is not the only type of equity investment. Many economists noted that venture capitalists are throwing ever-growing amounts of seed money into just about any startup that claims to incorporate AI into its business model, and expressed doubts that that investment growth rate is sustainable or that it’ll produce real returns. Venture capital investments in AI companies surged 62% last year, according to Crunchbase. There are worries about “circular financing” between big AI companies. In recent years, a number of Big Tech firms have signed AI investment and hardware purchasing deals worth tens of billions of dollars… with each other. This raises the question of whether all of the AI revenue reported by the likes of Microsoft, Nvidia and Alphabet is organic, or whether much of it consists of money from other tech companies that have recently gotten flush with investment due to AI hype themselves. AI may have real value, but that doesn’t rule out a dot-com bubble scenario. Many of the “yes” responses did not doubt that AI as a technology has huge potential, but they cautioned that this doesn’t disprove the theory that we’re in a bubble — and that this line of anti-bubble argument is suspicious in and of itself. Some drew comparisons to the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and early 2000s: Back then, investors correctly recognized the transformative economic potential of the nascent internet, but they still got carried away with their investments in internet stocks, eventually leading to a big correction. If you’re a longtime reader of The Nerdy Investor, or of NerdWallet in general, you probably have an idea of what we’re going to say here. When we write about a potential downside risk in the market, we often come back to the refrain that investment diversification is the best defense, and that index funds and ETFs are the easiest way for most investors to ensure they’re well-diversified. Yeah, you could try to actively bet against potentially-overvalued AI companies by buying put options on them, short-selling them, or buying inverse ETFs that contain them, but these are risky moves that lose most people money. Here’s the thing, though… If we are in an AI bubble, this may be one situation where many popular index funds aren’t that safe, either. Back in August, I wrote about how Nvidia made up about 8% of the entire S&P 500 index (around 7% today) by market capitalization, and how the seven largest S&P 500 stocks, which are all tech companies with substantial AI interests, make up about a third of the index. The situation is even more dire for the Nasdaq 100, where Nvidia makes up more than 13% of the index, and the top 7 stocks (all AI-related tech names) make up well over half of it. However, there are still ways to diversify through other types of index funds, if you think outside the box a little bit. Here are a few ideas: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is one index that is tracked by several ETFs and mutual funds, and it isn’t disproportionately made up of Nvidia and other tech stocks, because it’s a stock price-weighted index rather than a market cap-weighted index. Nvidia makes up less than 2.5% of the Dow, and Big Tech in general accounts for less than 25% of it. (Check out our article on Dow Jones ETFs for more information). The Russell 2000, an index of small-cap stocks tracked by many ETFs and mutual funds, is even less tech-y than the Dow. Tech accounts for less than 14% of it; it mostly consists of companies in the industrial, health care and financial sectors. One caveat: Small-cap stocks can be volatile. Although the Russell 2000 has limited exposure to AI and tech, it may still swoon in an AI bubble-burst scenario if investors are spooked into selling risky stocks in general. (NerdWallet maintains a list of the best-performing small-cap ETFs). Equal-weight S&P 500 ETFs are one way to get exposure to the S&P 500 companies while solving the Nvidia/Big Tech concentration problem. As we wrote in this newsletter issue a few weeks ago, they’re less AI-exposed than regular market cap-weight S&P 500 funds, and often pay higher dividend yields, but they tend to have significantly higher fees as well, and have trailed normal S&P 500 ETFs in returns this year. International ETFs could also be worth a look. The Vanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US ETF (VEU), for example, is less than 14% tech stocks by market cap.

Title: Nvidia’s Biggest AI Bet Is Crashing Its ‘Secret Portfolio.’ Can It Recover?

Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has assembled a strategic portfolio of public investments in AI-focused companies, including chip designers, data center operators, and infrastructure providers that not many investors are aware of. It consists of six holdings that at the end of the third quarter was valued at approximately $3.84 billion. The dominant position is in CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV), the AI-specialized cloud provider that relies heavily on Nvidia GPUs and accounts for over 86% of the portfolio’s value. Nvidia invested $350 million in CoreWeave in two tranches before its March IPO. Having originally invested $100 million in April 2023, it invested another $250 million just before its public debut, giving it a total of approximately 24.2 million shares at $40 per share, securing a 7% stake for Nvidia. Following the IPO, CoreWeave surged to an all-time high of $187 per share in June, but has been on a fairly steady decline since. Despite almost doubling from the IPO price, the stock is down nearly 60% from that peak. On Friday, it suffered another 10% drop, bringing its market capitalization to around $39 billion — a sharp erosion from the nearly $80 billion it was worth at the end of June. Friday’s plunge followed an SEC Form 4 filing revealing that Chief Financial Officer Nitin Agrawal sold 66,467 shares on December 11 at an average price of $82.58, totaling approximately $5.49 million. While investors are often reminded to ignore insider sales because they can sell stock for any reason — or no reason at all — those made by CFOs should be noted because of their specialized knowledge of the company’s finances. However, Agrawal’s transaction stemmed from the vesting of restricted stock units, with the sale covering associated tax withholding obligations. Insider sales are common upon RSU vesting and often serve administrative purposes rather than signaling fundamental concerns. This was a non-event for CoreWeave, and Agrawal still owns over 203,000 shares after the sale. Yet, CoreWeave’s challenges reflect broader skepticism about the AI sector’s growth trajectory. Analysts and investors have highlighted potential “circular financing” dynamics, where Nvidia provides investments or capacity commitments to customers that purchase its hardware. CoreWeave’s arrangement with Nvidia includes a $6.3 billion agreement under which Nvidia commits to purchasing any unsold cloud computing capacity through April 2032, providing a revenue backstop but raising questions about true end-user demand. Across the industry, major technology companies are increasingly relying on debt to fund expansive AI infrastructure projects as operational cash flows prove insufficient. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) issued $30 billion in bonds in 2025 to support data center expansions, and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) just faced investor backlash after its Q3 earnings. Its stock dropped 15% on concerns over ballooning debt levels that exceed $100 billion and negative free cash flow tied to AI commitments. These developments have fueled debates about overinvestment risks, potential capacity gluts, and the long-term profitability of AI buildouts. For CoreWeave, despite reporting strong Q3 revenue of $1.36 billion (up significantly year-over-year) and a substantial backlog, the company posted ongoing net losses and relies heavily on debt financing, including a $2.6 billion convertible notes offering completed just this month, albeit at a low 1.75% interest rate. High capital expenditures for data center expansion — projected to be in the tens of billions of dollars over the coming years — are seen as straining its balance sheet. CoreWeave is the primary drag on Nvidia’s investment portfolio performance. Although five of the six holdings have declined since the end of Q3 — contributing to a significant overall drop in portfolio value — CoreWeave’s 42% decline has been roughly twice as severe as the next-largest loser, Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS), which is down 22%. Only Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD) has recorded gains during this period. Analysts maintain a generally positive outlook on CoreWeave, though, citing its revenue growth, customer relationships, and backlog as supportive factors. However, a sustained recovery hinges on demonstrating profitable execution, managing leverage effectively, and proving that enduring AI demand exists in the face of financing and sustainability doubts. Until it can demonstrate this, I wouldn’t be buying into CoreWeave just yet. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.
