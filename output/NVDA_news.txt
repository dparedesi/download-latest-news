Title: Here’s why Trump killing the ‘AI diffusion rule’ is a win for chipmakers

The U.S. government plans to withdraw a rule introduced under the Biden administration that had aimed to restrict exports of advanced AI chips — a policy that had posed challenges for major semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD). “The Biden AI rule is overly complex, overly bureaucratic and would stymie American innovation,” a spokeswoman from the Commerce Department said in a statement. The Trump administration intends to issue a revised version of the rule, which was set to come into effect on May 15. This process could take months to finalize, sources told Axios. The regulation in question — titled the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion — would have limited exports of AI chips to over 100 countries. These restrictions aimed to prevent countries from bypassing U.S. export controls, particularly in relation to China. Chipmakers had criticized the rules, however. They argued it would give an advantage to Chinese competitors, such as Huawei, as they develop and sell their own AI hardware, foregoing an opportunity to ensure that much of the world would rely on American technology. The rule would have affected Nvidia’s ability to sell its high-demand graphics processing units, or GPUs, in markets such as India, Mexico, Singapore, and Switzerland. The shift could reflect a relaxing stance toward regulating AI, offering a momentary boon for chipmakers. Since Bloomberg first reported the reversal on Wednesday, Nvidia and AMD stocks have gained 4.4% and 3.4%, respectively. But any respite could prove temporary, and obstacles persist when it comes to accessing the crucial Chinese market. Nvidia’s most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100, are already banned from export to China, as a result of Biden-era restrictions. Last month the Trump administration also introduced new license requirements for less powerful chips by Nvidia and AMD in order to comply with export controls. Nvidia said these requirements on its H20 chips had resulted in a $5.5 billion hit to its quarterly earnings, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company’s earnings are scheduled to be released May 28. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Arm Holdings (ARM) delivered an outlook that came in below analysts' expectations, sending shares lower in extended trading Wednesday. The chip designer and Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it anticipates fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 30 cents to 38 cents, short of the 41 cents called for by Wall Street, according to Visible Alpha. Arm's revenue forecast, of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, was also lower than the analyst consensus at the midpoint of its range. Arm shares fell some 9% in after-hours trading. The stock is up less than 1% so far in 2025 through Wednesday’s close. In its fiscal fourth quarter, Arm posted record revenue of $1.24 billion, up 34% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Adjusted net income was $584 million, or 55 cents per share, compared to $376 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier, surpassing Wall Street’s estimates. Arm's royalty revenue improved 18% to a record $607 million, while its license and other revenue gained 53% to $634 million.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Entrepreneur Grant Cardone is celebrating what he calls the beginning of America’s biggest comeback ever, thanks to President Donald Trump’s push to bring tech manufacturing back to the U.S. Cardone posted on X after Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday to announce a massive new chip investment. “America is about to have its greatest resurgence in its 250 year history. Thank you President Trump for ‘encouraging' big tech to come home,” Cardone wrote, sharing a video of Huang’s remarks. Don't Miss: Mode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news.

Earning Opportunity for All Smartphone Users Mode EarnPhone State-of-the-art smartphone device includes built-in earning features. EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. During the event, Trump introduced Huang as “the founder, CEO and president of NVIDIA,” and said he was producing up to $500 billion worth of the most powerful AI chips over the next four years—all to be manufactured in the U.S. for the first time ever. Huang said, “NVIDIA reinvented computing for the first time after 60 years,” noting that modern computer design hasn’t changed much since IBM’s System/360 in the 1960s. But the new AI chips are a big leap forward. “That GPU—that’s one GPU unit—it’s 70 pounds, 60,000 parts, 10,000 watts,” Huang said. “Just to test a superchip requires a supercomputer.” Trending: Donald Trump just announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal — here's how you can invest in the entertainment market's next big disruptor at $2.25 per share. Huang credited Trump for pushing manufacturing to happen in the U.S. “Without the president’s leadership, his policies, his support, and very importantly, his strong encouragement … manufacturing in the United States wouldn’t have accelerated to this pace,” he said. He emphasized that making these chips isn’t about cheap labor—it’s about advanced tech, robotics, and AI. Nvidia will also use its Omniverse digital twin technology to help build cutting-edge factories on U.S. soil. “This new industry is a manufacturing industry in itself,” Huang said. “We now have the backing of the administration, the backing of President Trump, to support the creation of a whole new industry.” See Also: Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary called Missing Ring his biggest mistake — Don't repeat history—invest in RYSE at just $1.90/share. Huang said the AI infrastructure being built in the U.S. will power breakthroughs in healthcare, financial services, drug discovery, education, and more. “This computer is the engine of a whole new industry,” he said. “Electricity goes into this machine and incredible tokens come out—artificial intelligence.” Nvidia’s partnership with the Trump administration may be shaping up to be a key turning point in bringing high-tech manufacturing back to the U.S., and Cardone believes it could mark the beginning of a historic economic transformation.

Title: Supermicro Stock Drops as Server Maker Lowers Its Revenue Outlook
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/supermicro-stock-drops-as-server-maker-lowers-its-revenue-outlook-11729617
Time Published: 2025-05-06T22:41:03Z
Full Content:
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) cut its full-year revenue outlook, sending shares lower in extended trading Tuesday. The server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it now expects fiscal 2025 revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.6 billion, down from its prior range of $23.5 billion to $25 billion. Supermicro shares fell over 6% in after-hours trading following the release. For the fiscal third quarter, Supermicro posted revenue of $4.6 billion, up nearly 20% year-over-year and at the high end of its significantly reduced forecast. Adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share fell from 66 cents per share a year earlier. Supermicro said it anticipates fourth-quarter sales of $5.6 billion to $6.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 40 cents to 50 cents. CEO Charles Liang said some Supermicro clients delayed making product decisions during the period, which pushed sales beyond the fiscal third quarter. “We do expect many of those commitments to land in the June and September quarters, reinforcing my confidence in our ability to meet our long-term targets, however economic uncertainty and tariff impacts may have a short-term impact,” Liang said. Supermicro shares have seen significant volatility this year as concerns about the company's accounting practices and delayed filings raised worries it could be delisted from the Nasdaq. The company ultimately met the exchange’s deadline to file its delayed reports in February, but still faces challenges, including uncertainty around how it could be affected by shifting tariff policies.

Time Published: 2025-05-06T19:03:48Z

If you’ve been researching investment options for building long-term wealth, chances are you’ve come across the term “VTSAX.” It’s one of the most recommended mutual funds among financial experts and personal finance communities. But what exactly is VTSAX, how does it work, and is it the right investment for you? In this comprehensive guide, we break down everything you need to know about VTSAX in simple terms. Whether you’re a beginner or just looking to understand this fund better, this article is designed to help you make an informed investment decision. Contents VTSAX stands for Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares. It is a low-cost mutual fund offered by Vanguard, one of the largest investment companies in the world. VTSAX is designed to give investors exposure to the entire U.S. stock market in a single investment. This means that when you invest in VTSAX, you own a tiny piece of over 4,000 publicly traded U.S. companies – from large corporations like Apple and Microsoft to small-cap stocks you’ve probably never heard of. The popularity of VTSAX boils down to a few key benefits: VTSAX uses a passive investing strategy. It aims to mirror the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, which includes nearly all U.S. stocks across various sectors and market capitalizations (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap). Instead of trying to beat the market like actively managed funds do, VTSAX simply tracks it. This strategy leads to lower trading costs, minimal turnover, and greater tax efficiency. VTSAX holds thousands of companies across a wide range of industries. Some of the top holdings include: These top holdings typically make up a larger percentage of the fund due to their market capitalization. Many investors compare VTSAX vs VTI because both offer exposure to the total U.S. stock market. The main differences are: Functionally, both are nearly identical in terms of holdings, performance, and expense ratio. VTSAX is ideal for: However, it may not be suitable for short-term traders or those looking for high-risk, high-reward investments. To invest in VTSAX, you typically need to: You can also set up automatic investments and dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP) for VTSAX. One of the biggest advantages of VTSAX is its low expense ratio of 0.04%. That means you pay just $4 annually for every $10,000 invested. This low fee helps more of your money stay invested and grow over time. There are no load fees or commission fees when buying directly through Vanguard. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, VTSAX has historically performed in line with the overall U.S. stock market. Over the long term (10+ years), the average annual return has been approximately 7-10% depending on market conditions. During bull markets, VTSAX tends to rise steadily, and during bear markets, it will decline, but not as drastically as individual stocks. VTSAX pays quarterly dividends that can be reinvested or taken as cash. These dividends come from the profits of the companies in the fund and can provide passive income, especially over time as your investment grows. Dividend yield typically ranges from 1.2% to 2.0%, depending on market conditions. Like all investments, VTSAX carries some risk: Here’s how VTSAX compares to similar total market funds: VTSAX is one of the best all-in-one investment options available today. It combines simplicity, low costs, and broad diversification, making it an excellent choice for investors who want to grow wealth steadily over the long term. Whether you’re saving for retirement, building a nest egg, or just starting out, VTSAX offers a reliable path toward financial independence. If you’re looking for a single fund that provides exposure to the entire U.S. economy with minimal effort and fees, VTSAX is hard to beat. FAQs About VTSAX Is VTSAX good for beginners? Yes. VTSAX is one of the most beginner-friendly investments due to its simplicity and diversification. What account should I use to invest in VTSAX? Tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs, Traditional IRAs, or 401(k)s are ideal. Can I lose money with VTSAX? Yes, VTSAX is subject to market risks. However, the long-term trend of the stock market has historically been upward. How do I buy VTSAX if I don’t have $3,000? You can invest in VTI, the ETF version of VTSAX, which has no minimum investment. Does VTSAX include international stocks? No, it only includes U.S. stocks. For international exposure, consider adding VTIAX to your portfolio. Categorized in: Share Article: Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Time Published: 2025-05-06T16:45:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said AI has revived a dying San Francisco that many thought wouldn’t recover from the pandemic. “It’s because of AI that San Francisco is back,” Huang said while speaking to Jacob Helberg, Trump’s undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, at The Hill & Valley Forum. “Anybody who lives in San Francisco, you’ll know what I’m talking about. Just about everybody evacuated San Francisco,” he said, “Now it’s thriving again. It’s all because of AI.” A 2024 article from The San Francisco Standard called AI companies San Francisco’s “most desired tenants.” It cited a JLL (JLL) report that found AI companies leased north of 1.7 million square feet of office space since 2022, when ChatGPT was released. Chris Pham, senior analyst at JLL, predicted a continued AI boom in the city, likening it to the invention of electricity, instead of just another new industry. In his remarks with Helberg, Huang acknowledged that as AI progresses, “new jobs will be created, some jobs will be lost, and every job will be changed.” “It’s not AI that’s going to take your job. It’s not AI that’s going to destroy your company,” he said, encouraging widespread adoption of the technology. “It’s the company and the person who uses AI that’s going to take your job. And so that’s something to internalize.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Trump was joined by CEOs to highlight companies and their investments in the United States during the event. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its Q1 earnings towards the end of May. The consensus estimates earnings of $0.89 per share, reflecting a 45% increase from the previous year, while revenues are projected to rise by 65% year-over-year to $43 billion. This growth is expected to be fueled by sustained high demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. In the prior quarter, Nvidia reported having significantly increased the large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, equipped with advanced AI features and premium pricing, could potentially enhance top-line growth throughout Q1 FY’26 (FY’25 concluded in January 2025), while also improving margins. However, investors will keep a close eye on Nvidia’s future projections, especially given the growing uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policies and tariffs affecting key trading partners. The Trump administration is also considering tighter regulations on AI chip exports through newly introduced AI diffusion rules, which could represent a considerable threat to Nvidia’s long-term growth by restricting sales in crucial international markets. Separately, the past three years portend a 60% chance of a positive move, see: How Will D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) Stock React To Its Upcoming Earnings? Nvidia currently has a market capitalization of $2.7 trillion. Revenue over the previous twelve months amounted to $130 billion, alongside an operational profit of $81 billion and a net income of $73 billion. That said, for those seeking upside potential with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivering returns exceeding 91% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. NVDA 1D, 5D, and 21D Post-Earnings Return A relatively less risky approach (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair that exhibits the highest correlation, and execute the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the following 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data extracted from the 5-year and 3-year (more recent) historical performance. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA Correlation Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns At times, the performance of peers can impact the stock's reaction following earnings. In fact, the pricing in may commence prior to the earnings announcement. Here is some historical data comparing the post-earnings performance of Nvidia stock with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent one-day (1D) post-earnings returns.

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about investing, markets and Berkshire Hathaway. ByBill Stone, Contributor. Beyond tariffs and earnings, the big event will be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Markets ... More expect no rate changes from the Federal Reserve. The focus will be on Chair Powell’s comments and whether June is a likely time to lower rates again. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) After the busiest week of earnings releases, almost three-quarters of companies have released results. 76% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. This earnings season slows this week, with 93 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. In addition to earnings, the Federal Reserve (Fed) meets on Wednesday. S&P 500 Earnings Season According to FactSet data, the healthcare, consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology sectors contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 12.8% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings and sales growth rates for calendar years 2025 and 2026 have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks higher by 2.9% last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 7.5% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. The group is 17% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Total Returns Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week, and all but Amazon outperformed expectations. While Amazon came up short, the earnings pace was robust, and the stock was still higher for the week. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA) is the last of the magnificent 7 stocks yet to report and is not expected until the end of May. Magnificent 7 Earnings Beyond the Magnificent 7, this week of the reporting season has some notable companies scheduled, including Clorox (CLX), Uber Technologies (UBER), Emerson Electric (EMR), and Walt Disney (DIS). Earnings Insights By Sector According to FactSet data, the healthcare, consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology sectors were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings. It was a broad-based improvement in earnings as every sector except energy saw better earnings growth rates last week. Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.8% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Sales Growth By Sector As discussed in a previous piece, a surge in imports was a massive headwind to GDP growth. Net exports were a whopping 4.8 percentage point drag on the economy. According to Goldman Sachs, this is the most significant drag from net exports on record as companies raced to import goods to avoid the coming tariffs. GDP Components Due to the trade distortion, final sales to private domestic purchasers are a better measure to watch, and they continued to perform well at 3% growth. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. Measures Of Economic Activity Monthly nonfarm payrolls grew by an above-consensus 177,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Despite the 58,000 downward revision of payroll jobs over the previous months, the monthly jobs report has to be considered solid. Monthly Jobs Report The GDP report, especially when combined with the monthly jobs growth, does not signal an imminent recession despite the -0.3% decline in headline economic activity. This does not mean that we won’t eventually see more economic slowing due to tariffs, but this isn’t it yet. Consumer spending did moderate somewhat, so it is still fair to say the economy was softening a bit even before the tariff impact. Markets will remain very attuned to newsflow around the tariffs since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of the economic growth headwind. Beyond tariffs, the big event will be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Markets expect no rate changes from the Federal Reserve, especially after the better-than-expected jobs report. The focus will be on Chair Powell’s comments and whether June is a likely time to lower rates again. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Despite the negative GDP results for the first quarter, the economy is not in a recession. This view is further bolstered by the better-than-expected job growth reported last week. The Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) annual meeting and first quarter earnings release on Saturday were eventful. Warren Buffett shocked the crowd with the announcement that he plans to resign from his role as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at year-end.

After blockbuster earnings last week from Big Tech, capped by Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and a weekend of Buffett wisdom at Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A) annual meeting, markets are still digesting what it all means. The Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq are rallying, but Main Street signals remain mixed, and inflation, tariffs, and consumer caution continue to ripple through corporate results. The week ahead won’t quite match the mega-cap frenzy, but there’s still plenty to watch — especially in sectors like energy, pharma, and industrials. It may be a big week for Fed news, too, with the Fed making an announcement Wednesday — though no interest rate change is expected at this time. The week kicks off with a closely watched read on the U.S. service sector: the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for April is due Monday morning. This report tracks activity in industries like retail, health care, and hospitality — which together make up the bulk of the U.S. economy — and can offer key clues about broader momentum, or the lack of it. Earnings slow down from last week’s Big Tech bonanza, but Monday still brings key updates from across sectors. Palantir (PLTR) reports after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS double last year’s result, amid continued interest in its AI-driven government and commercial contracts. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is also due, with EPS forecast slightly down from last year’s. Ford (F), expected to post flat earnings, faces scrutiny over its EV roadmap and how it’s handling margin pressure and tariff uncertainty. Tyson Foods (TSN) and Clorox (CLX) round out the day — both offering windows into consumer behavior as household staples and prices continue to fluctuate. Markets will digest the latest U.S. International Trade Balance report Tuesday morning, offering fresh insight into America’s trade deficit for March. The data comes as tariff rhetoric continues to grab headlines, making this a key release for economists and policy watchers alike. But the biggest event of the week is likely to be the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. The FOMC meeting begins Tuesday and runs through Wednesday. After last week’s unexpectedly weak GDP print and increased signs of consumer hesitation, markets will be watching closely for any shift in tone. An announcement is expected Wednesday, the second day of the meeting. On the earnings front, Tuesday is a power-packed day across sectors. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also reports, and all eyes will be on its AI chip roadmap as the company looks to keep pace with Nvidia (NVDA). Arista Networks (ANET) will offer another read on AI infrastructure demand. Insurance and energy dominate elsewhere: Progressive (PGR), Duke Energy (DUK), Suncor (SU), and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) all report, giving investors fresh reads on consumer risk, oil supply dynamics, and refining margeins. Ferrari (RACE) and Marriot (MAR) round out the day with updates that touch on global demand, tariff impacts, and travel spending. Shopify (SHOP) kicks off tech results in the morning, with expectations for steady e-commerce growth. In the afternoon, expect Fed news as the FOMC meeting concludes. While no rate change is expected, the policy statement and press conference could offer clues about future cuts or delays. Coinbase (COIN) and Cheniere Energy (LNG) headline the afternoon, offering insight into crypto trading volume and U.S. LNG exports, respectively. Anheuser-Busch (BUD) will provide insights on global beer demand and pricing strategy, while ConocoPhillips (COP) provides an update on oil and gas margins amid geopolitical upheavals. Disney (DIS) also reports, with analysts looking to streaming profitability and theme park traffic. Uber (UBER) is on deck too, aiming to show continued progress on profitability and margin gains. Applovin (APP), DoorDash (DASH), and Arm Holdings (ARM) all report as well, giving another pulse check on digital advertising, food delivery, and semiconductor demand. Novo Nordisk (NVO) will provide updates on weight-loss drug momentum. Thursday brings a fresh wave of earnings from across the globe. Enbridge (ENB), Canada’s pipeline giant, headlines the morning, with investors watching closely for updates on energy infrastructure demand and regulatory dynamics. Commerzbank’s release will provide a read on the European banking environment amid ongoing rate and currency volatility. On the economic calendar, markets will digest the latest initial jobless claims data, which could reinforce — or challenge — narratives around a softening labor market following the prior week’s weaker-than-expected GDP print. Again Friday, a range of global earnings reports will provide cross-sector, cross-border takeaways. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
