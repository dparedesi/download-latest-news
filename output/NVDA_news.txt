Title: Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare?

Full Content:
On Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%. The company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence. Because of the AI-focus of its microchips, the company has drawn comparisons to NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA, the largest publicly traded company by market cap at $4.58 trillion. As an increasing level of global competition comes to the forefront, should shareholders be concerned about threats to NVIDIA’s dominance? On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter. At the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500. The MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing. For analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices. In turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out. But it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived. Now, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX. NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term. Over the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times. MetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years. Additionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success. Compounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.” Fund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.” Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. NVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon. The stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%. Over the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion. Another strong indication of health is that current short interest stands at just 1.13% of the float. Before you consider NVIDIA, you'll want to hear this.

ETH options data shows investors increasing downside protection as the year-end $6 billion options expry approaches, signaling caution. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ether (ETH) has been unable to sustain prices above $3,400 for the past 40 days, raising concerns among traders that bears may remain in control longer. Key takeaways: $6B in Ether options will expire on Friday, with call (buy) bets outnumbering put (sell) instruments by 2.2 times. Bears hold the advantage unless ETH price breaks $3,100. The $6 billion ETH options expiry on Friday may add further pressure, as bulls had anticipated year-end prices of $4,000 or higher before the 28% crash in November. Ether’s price at 8:00 am UTC on Friday will determine whether bears retain control, despite call options outnumbering put instruments by a factor of 2.2. Deribit accounts for 70% of total open interest, followed by the Chicago-based CME with 20%. However, most of the $4.1 billion in call options are set to expire worthless on Friday, as traders concentrated bullish bets on year-end Ether prices between $3,500 and $5,000. Less than 15% of aggregate call options were positioned at $3,000 or lower. Related: Trend Research quietly becomes one of Ethereum’s largest whales with 46K ETH buy Even excluding overly optimistic calls at $5,000 and above, which likely carried limited cost to buyers, data shows that fewer than 25% of these instruments were placed below $3,200. Traders often sell covered calls at $8,000 and $10,000 year-end strikes with no realistic expectation of reaching those levels. While bulls were overly confident that Ether would reclaim $3,400 by year-end, bearish strategies may also have gone too far by clustering bets between $2,200 and $2,900. If Ether trades above $2,950 on Friday, more than 60% of the $1.9 billion in aggregate put options will expire worthless. Even so, bearish positions remain better placed as long as ETH stays below $3,200. Investors reacted to Thursday’s reports that Intel failed in its push to manufacture advanced chips in the US as it sought to challenge global leader Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC US). According to Bloomberg, Nvidia (NVDA US) halted production tests that relied on Intel’s manufacturing processes. As traders priced in weaker prospects for the economic impact of artificial intelligence in the US, many moved to hedge their ETH positions. Demand for bearish ETH options strategies increased, including the “bear diagonal put spread,” “bear put spread” and “bear call spread,” particularly after multiple failed attempts to reclaim the $3,400 level over the past five weeks. Below are four probable scenarios for the year-end ETH aggregate options expiry based on current price trends: $2,700 to $2,900: The net result favors the put instruments by $580 million. $2,901 to $3,000: The net result favors the put instruments by $440 million. $3,101 to $3,200: Balanced outcome between call and put options. $3,201 to $3,300: The net result favors the call instruments by $150 million. A Friday expiry below $2,900 could further weaken Ether investor sentiment. However, Ether bulls still have an opportunity to push prices toward $3,100 on Friday, which would help balance positioning and distance Ether’s price from the $2,775 December lows.
