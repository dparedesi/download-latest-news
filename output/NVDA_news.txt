The Dow surged by over 570 points Thursday afternoon, buoyed by strong earnings from Nvidia (NVDA-3.25%), which briefly hit a 52-week high of $152.89 per share earlier in the day. Meanwhile, shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+10.37%) rose over 14% after Nvidia mentioned its partner during an earnings call on Wednesday. Considering Super Micro’s previous accounting issues, investors might feel reassured that the partnership is strong enough for the company to be featured. As a reseller of Nvidia’s GPUs and other components, Super Micro incorporates Nvidia’s technology into its servers to support AI workloads. The two companies have a long-standing relationship, and both CEOs—Charles Liang of Super Micro and Jensen Huang of Nvidia—are Taiwanese immigrants. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 572 points or 1.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 0.15% and 0.6%, respectively. The Russell 2000 Index, which is viewed as a barometer for small companies, added more than 1%. Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.25% shares hit a 52-week high early Thursday morning, dipped several hours later, and then rose again. The chipmaker’s revenues for the quarter ended in October were up 17% from the previous quarter’s revenues of $30 billion. Nvidia reported net income of $19.3 billion, and earnings per share, or EPS, of $0.78. The company’s quarterly data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 17% from the previous quarter, and up 112% year over year. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the company’s Blackwell chip contributed significantly to its earnings growth. Bitcoin’s rally shows no signs of slowing, with the leading cryptocurrency surging past the $98,000 to hit a new all-time high. According to data from the crypto tracking platform CoinGecko, Bitcoin reached $98,310 on Thursday. This ascent follows the debut of Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) options earlier this week—a landmark moment for the cryptocurrency industry. – Britney Nguyen contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia is in for larger beats as Blackwell rolls out, analysts say

Despite Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.25%) modest guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter, analysts are anticipating larger earnings beats on strong demand for its new artificial intelligence platform. The chipmaker set its fiscal fourth quarter guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — slightly above expectations of $37.09 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.60%). Nvidia’s expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter were “likely hampered by ongoing Blackwell shipment constraints,” Kunjan Sobhani, senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note. Nvidia chief executive Colette Kress said both Blackwell and its predecessor, Hopper, are facing certain supply constraints, and that Blackwell demand is expected to exceed supply into fiscal year 2026. The modest guidance sent Nvidia’s shares slightly down in after-hours trading on Wednesday into Thursday morning. “Unfortunately, market participants have become too short-term oriented,” Eric Clark, portfolio manager at the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, said in a statement shared with Quartz. “Absolute good reports seem less interesting than relatively less good but still good. There is nothing wrong with NVDA, I suggest investors use any weakness to buy the stock because demand will be satisfied at some point and these slight misses will turn into big beats yet again.” On the company’s earnings call, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said production of its Blackwell AI platform “is in full steam” after a design flaw was fixed, and that the company expects to deliver more Blackwells in this quarter than previously estimated. In the fiscal third quarter, Nvidia said it shipped thirteen thousand Blackwell chips to customers. “The supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we’re going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year,” Huang said. Nvidia is likely “sold out” of Blackwell until the end of next year, and “has much better visibility in its forecasts than it is letting on,” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. “This allows it to offer guidance that it knows it can beat by a small margin, which will help the share price hold onto the massive rally it has enjoyed over the last 18 months,” Windsor said. Nvidia’s shares are up over 198% so far this year. Concerns with Blackwell’s commercial deliveries have not reflected in Nvidia’s earnings reports yet, likely because issues mostly center on data center infrastructure around the chips, and because customers don’t want “to lose their place in the queue” and are therefore buying Blackwell and fixing issues after, Windsor said. Huang addressed a report that Blackwell chips are overheating in custom-designed server racks, saying “as you see from all the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.” He also said Nvidia plans “to execute on our annual road map” of producing new chips. Jefferies (JEF+2.15%) analysts said in a note that they “are not overly concerned with any of the issues on this call” and that they “see increasing beats as Blackwell ramps.” But strong demand for Blackwell and Nvidia’s ability to deliver to customers despite production issues might not sustain growth in the long-term. “Despite demand in the near-term continuing to be strong, we still believe a decline in demand for NVIDIA compute is inevitable as customers begin to scrutinize their ROI on AI compute,” analysts at D.A. Davidson said in a note. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Apple Stock In 2025: A Prediction On Where It's Price May Head

Time Published: 2024-11-21T17:34:14Z

Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. If someone asked you to tell them the first thing you think of when you hear the word “apple,” your immediate response would probably say a lot about your age and what you have lived through. Maybe it would be a reference to Isaac Newton, who introduced the concept of gravity in the 1600s, and is the subject of a factually inaccurate story about an apple hitting him on the head. Or maybe it would be Apple, the record company famous for its longtime association with the Beatles. But the world-altering company started by a pair of college dropouts, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, in 1976 is likely what “apple” brings to mind first. That is, unless you’re a nutritionist. Apple (AAPL) is now a $3.4 trillion market cap company, whose product line of software and hardware have revolutionized personal communication and business productivity. It is its own ecosphere. But after decades of success, where is its stock price headed? Apple has grown revenue at an 8% rate the past five years, and carries a very manageable debt to equity ratio of less than 2.0. Its dividend yield was briefly high enough for some to consider it a yield stock last decade, but at 0.4% now, that yield only provides decent cash flow to the stock’s largest holders. Apple sells for 37x trailing earnings per share, and 30x next year’s earnings, which are both lofty figures. Through mid-November, the Apple stock was up 17%, well behind the S&P 500’s 24% return and the Nasdaq 100’s 23% gain. The stock is more than 8% of the latter index’s total value and more than 6% of the former’s weighting. So it is clearly a prominent stock, and its price has benefited from the massive inflows to index funds that track those popular market benchmarks.

Cost control is a priority, as is maintaining profit margins and a dominant market share in the areas in which it competes. In recent years, it has expanded its App Store, and its brick and mortar Apple stores have brought it to the people it serves, enhancing an already iconic culture. The iPhone is the leading source of revenue. Apple generated more than $46 billion in revenue from that segment alone during its latest quarter. However, iPads, Mac computers, watches, streaming video and the entire service component are also critical to the company’s continued growth. However, iPhone, now in its 16 version, is a mature business, and perhaps a victim of its own success, as adding updated versions of existing products is less profitable than the next new device or technology. Upgrade cycles contribute more to the company’s bottom line than innovation. That was not always the case. And the company has a new challenge, given its reliance on China, both for production and sales of Apple products. The iPhone is truly the centerpiece of the business, as other products are essentially designed around it. That is especially true of new applications, such as subscription bundles and augmented reality. With $25 billion in service segment revenue in the most recent quarter, this continues to be a driver for Apple. This includes iTunes, digital content, AppleCare, Apple Pay and licensing segments. This is a central part of the company’s future growth, as it provides a second juggernaut business line that makes up for potential cyclicality that has crept into the hardware segment as the company’s products are now so widely owned. Global expansion is an ever-present project for the U.S.-based Apple. The company has helped its own growth in relatively poorer countries by offering installment plan purchases. That has helped it expand in Europe and China, and it now has its sites set on deeper penetration of emerging economies.

As with many market sectors, Apple is likely to be impacted by the dramatic turn of events in Washington D.C. The new administration is determined to reshore manufacturing, and become more inwardly-focused. Apple, as a prominent global manufacturer, is going to have to navigate that situation, and it is way too early to determine how that will work out. This may be where its oligopolistic nature and confirmed industry leadership provides a strong backstop. Based on estimates compiled by Seeking Alpha, Apple is projected to earn $415 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025, which ends next September. That implies a price to sales ratio of 8.2, which is not cheap. Earnings are expected to grow to $7.40 a share, which is certainly strong, but also not enough to make the stock inexpensive. As for sentiment, the best way to view that is in the chart pattern (at least, that’s my view after charting stocks for 44 years). On that measure, Apple is again a victim of its own success, but there is a potential silver lining. At around $225 a share, its price has stagnated while younger businesses like Nvidia (NVDA) have rocketed higher, the way Apple’s stock used to do. Apple’s chart is rangebound. However, its price has been trending up steadily, not dramatically, since back in August 2020, when it split its stock price 4-for-1. In 2025 and each successive year beyond that, Apple’s biggest challenge is not staying in business or producing massive revenue. It is too entrenched in too many areas for that to happen. However, being great doesn’t always impress Wall Street, especially when your stock is so richly valued. So what Apple will need to do going forward is to justify its valuation to investors. That is harder to do as a mature business than when it was proverbially taking over the world with its cutting-edge technology and innovation, changing our lives for the better. Over the past 18 months, Apple’s stock price has traded in a range from $165 to $235, and it currently sits near the top of that range. So a sustained breakout through that upper level will be needed for the stock to avoid disappointing investors in the coming year. And with the most recent path to its recent all time highs originating from the $190 area, that will be a key test if the stock breaks down. Apple is far from an upstart, but a cash-rich balance sheet, debt it can manage well, and a “wide moat” via its very devoted customer base all make this a stock that likely has a floor. However, it is a prominent part of the S&P 500, and that means it is always at risk of being caught up in market-wide selloffs. I judge the stock price to be vulnerable at these levels, both chart-wise and due to its hefty valuation. However, if any business can continue its run of being in Wall Street’s good graces, this is it. Post-U.S.-election policy, as well as Apple’s ability to continue expanding its global footprint. And, its success in avoiding disruption of its low-cost production efforts. It is growing, though not at the rate it was, and that growth is likely priced into the stock already. Apple recently scrapped its Project Titan, which aimed to develop a self-driving car to compete with Tesla and others. This ends about a decade of speculation and efforts in this area. Apple will settle instead for applying what it learned from that ill-fated project to other parts of its business, including Apple Carplay. “Safe” and “stock market investing” are two things that simply do not overlap. That is evidenced by the fact that this leading company’s stock has suffered numerous 50% drawdowns in its history, including an 81% peak-to-trough decline. The last big test for the broad stock market was in 2022, when the S&P 500 index fell 18%. Apple stock fell by 26%. So it is far from immune to macro market issues. That said, its strong financial condition is an above-average support mechanism for very long-term investors in the stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 500 points, or 1.2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to hover near the flatline. Investors gravitated towards Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while selling off Big Tech. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down about 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dragged on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year.

New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail.

And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release “should be framed and hung in the Louvre” in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn’t go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia’s financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a statement. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) weighed on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021.

But it still has a way to go.

The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile.

Title: ASML Remains A Valid Medium-Term Investment Despite Weak Outlook
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/11/21/asml-remains-a-valid-medium-term-investment-despite-weak-outlook/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T16:08:27Z
Full Content:
By Oliver Rodzianko Summary ASML (ASML, Financial) is well-known among technology investors as "the most important tech company you've never heard of." The statement is largely true, given its monopoly on supplying the machines used by the world's largest advanced semiconductor foundries. While 2025 was initially expected to be a blockbuster year for the stock, the outlook has recently shifted. With a revised and weaker demand forecast, ASML's stock price has declined significantly. While the market's response is understandable, I believe the stock is slightly oversold in the near term. This correction presents an opportunity for a 20% increase in its enterprise value over the next 12 months. Q3-informed operational analysis ASML reported year-over-year normalized EPS growth of 15.66% in Q3, alongside revenue of $8.13 billion. However, it also issued a much weaker 2025 outlook than previously anticipated. Just a few months ago, management projected total revenue growth for 2025 of 45%. Now, the consensus revenue estimate has been revised down to just 15%. Management noted delays in the timing of lithography demand, particularly for extreme ultraviolet (‘EUV') systems—ASML's core product—due to slower ramp-ups in fabrication. While this has received little attention, I believe much of this demand issue is tied to the slowing expansion of AI data centers, likely to impact 2025, 2026, and 2027. ASML invested heavily in expanding its production capacity throughout 2024 but was unable to fully capitalize on the surge in demand driven by heightened AI sentiment. Now, as production capacity has increased, demand for AI data centers is tapering, meaning key foundries are seeking fewer machines. For instance, Samsung has of ASML's EUV equipment for its new factory in Texas, citing difficulties securing major customers. Intel's (INTC, Financial) delay in expanding its European fabs and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (‘TSMC') (TSM, Financial) cautious approach to new node adoption are also contributing to the slower rollout of advanced lithography tools like EUV systems. Furthermore, trade tensions and export restrictions with China are limiting ASML's ability to sell certain machines. Given these factors, the expensive transition to fine-resolution EUV machines has caused customers to delay adoption. This is a serious revelation for investors and a factor I wish I had identified earlier. The semiconductor and AI industries are in a state of flux, but it's increasingly evident that the semiconductor sector of AI is cyclical. Semiconductor sales can't provide recurring revenue outside of technology ramp-ups, such as with AI infrastructure build-outs. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have successfully developed recurring revenue platforms through software and cloud services, this is far more challenging for a machine maker like ASML. The initial upcycle for AI infrastructure may be nearing its peak as growth rates are starting to slow. From a macro perspective, ASML may have missed this cycle's highest-growth opportunity window. Valuation and financial analysis As of this writing, ASML's shares have declined by approximately 22.5% since the Q3 report, driven entirely by the weaker 2025 outlook. The company's forward P/E GAAP ratio now stands at 33, reflecting a 17.5% decline from its five-year average, while its forward EV-to-sales ratio is 8.83, a 17.6% decline from its five-year average. This valuation contraction is justified, given the much weaker growth outlook. ASML's five-year historical average forward GAAP EPS growth CAGR was 22.4%, but it currently sits at a significantly lower 16.8%. With management forecasting 2025 revenue between $30 billion and $35 billion, I estimate they will likely reach the upper end of this range. After underperforming their previous forecast, it seems management is now underpromising with the intention of overdelivering. I project the company could achieve a full-year revenue of at least $33 billion. With an EV-to-sales ratio expansion to approximately 9.5 over this period, the company's enterprise value could reach $313.5 billion, representing a 19.23% increase from the current $262.93 billion. ASML Revenue and PS Comparison Chart Based on the analysis above, I'm inclined to consider ASML moderately undervalued at the moment for a near-term allocation. Despite the weaker 2025 outlook reported by management, I still expect the year to be strong in terms of market sentiment. While the market is generally efficient, it tends to momentarily oversell stocks on bad news. In this case, I believe ASML presents a compelling near-term value opportunity. Furthermore, while it is richly valued compared to Applied Material and Lam Research, it has the growth rates—and the market-leading position—to support this. ASML's revenues are cyclical, so the growth surge expected in 2025 won't last indefinitely. Unfortunately, semiconductor stocks aren't typically suited for passive long-term allocations (unless one is comfortable enduring significant volatility). Instead, I believe semiconductor stocks are best purchased near the start of an upcycle and sold close to the peak. While it's impossible to time the market perfectly, buying and selling based on fundamental growth trends is a prudent strategy in this sector. The difference with ASML is that it has established a market-leading position, and with long-term trends in AI, particularly as the market shifts toward model inference demand and away from model training, ASML is well-positioned to continue benefiting. However, there will be a downcycle after the current AI model training infrastructure build-out is completed. For this reason, I do not believe now is the right time to buy ASML as a long-term investment. I'd suggest monitoring its valuation closer to Q4 2025 and then holding it for five to six years if the valuation remains reasonable throughout the period. Conservative discounted EBITDA analysis While my 12-month enterprise value target offers valuable insight into the near-term returns investors may expect, a discounted EBITDA model provides a more thorough assessment of the company's intrinsic value. Although 2025 and 2026 are likely to be particularly strong growth years for ASML, the company has several robust years of expansion ahead. For this discounted EBITDA model, I am using a six-year time frame, which I believe could be the optimal holding period for cyclical, medium-term ASML investors. Starting with projected full-year revenue of $30 billion in December 2024 (to be conservative and for the highest security possible), I estimate revenue will grow at an average year-over-year rate of 12.5% through to December 2030. The company's current EBITDA margin is 33.8%, slightly above its five-year average of 33.12%. To maintain a conservative outlook, I assume an average EBITDA margin of 32.5% over the projection period, accounting for the effect of current pressures. Based on these assumptions, ASML's estimated full-year EBITDA for 2024 will be approximately $10.14 billion, increasing to around $19.77 billion by 2030. Given ASML's 10-year median EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 26.5, which aligns closely with the current trailing 12-month ratio of 26.65, I am applying a terminal multiple of 26 in this model. Risk analysis While ASML currently faces no significant direct competitors in EUV technology, efforts are underway in China to develop semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. China has a strategic focus on becoming self-sufficient in semiconductor production, but ASML has built an insurmountable moat in this space. I expect emerging competitors from China to be proficient but not market leaders. However, similar to how Intel is attempting to capture market share from TSMC, companies like Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment ('SMEE') are actively trying to take market share from ASML. Moreover, ASML plays a crucial role in the semiconductor supply chain, making it essential to understand the macroeconomic and geopolitical risks stemming from current international tensions. We are in a precarious moment in history, and tensions between China and the West could escalate, even with a Trump presidency. Trump has made it clear that he will impose heavy tariffs on China and other importing countries, raising concerns of a potential trade war. However, because Trump has a transactional and economically competitive approach to international relations (rather than hostile), as well as an isolationist stance geopolitically, I believe conditions between the U.S. and China will remain quite robust for at least the next four years. This supports my investment thesis for ASML, and I believe it is prudent to proceed with capital allocation to the semiconductor and technology markets. Conclusion ASML is about to enter an upcycle, which I expect could bring volatility in its stock price by 2026 or 2027 if it becomes overvalued. ASML appears attractive as a near-term cyclical allocation rather than a long-term one, but it also could work as a medium-term holding if the valuation remains reasonable over the next five to six years. While 2025 may not be as robust as I initially projected three months ago, the opportunity remains strong. Despite rising competition from Chinese companies and a vulnerable macroeconomic environment driven by geopolitical factors, ASML is worth buying at its current valuation for exposure to the forthcoming growth.

Millions of young Americans are forging unconventional paths to early retirement amid a growing desire for financial freedom and greater flexibility in spending their time. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the percentage of people willing to work full-time after age 62 fell to 45.8% in March, compared to 55% in March 2014. Don't Miss: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.25/share How are young investors using dividend investing for early retirement? Let's examine a case study. Last month, an investor shared his detailed income report with portfolio screenshots on r/dividends, a discussion board for income investors on Reddit with 618,000 members. He said he reached about $61,600 in annual dividend income or $5,130 per month and was "finally able to retire." "There will come a day when I can put these distributions to good use. For now, we are just reinvesting," he added. The investor's portfolio showed most of his money was in risky, high-yield YIELDMAX ETFs that generate money by selling call options. Redditors quickly reminded the investor about how risky his investments were and why he could end up in losses during his retirement. However, the investor sounded self-assured, saying he was doing "not too bad right now." "Waiting till the end of 2024 to see where it’s at," he responded to a commenter who warned him that his principal was at risk of going to "zero." According to the screenshots shared by the investor, his total portfolio dividend yield was 9.89%. Since his annual dividend income is $61,600, his total portfolio value was roughly over $622,000.

US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to slip 0.5%, as Nvidia and Alphabet led the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lower. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down nearly 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short-seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly president-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021.

But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

Title: Nvidia Reports Another Blowout Quarter—Here’s Why Its Stock Price Is Falling

Nvidia (NVDA) is retaining its title as the darling of the A.I. revolution—at least for the time being. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker reported record revenue yesterday (Nov. 20) for the July-September quarter that surpassed Wall Street’s already lofty expectations. Demand for Nvidia’s A.I. chips continues soaring, according to the company’s CEO Jensen Huang. “The age of A.I. is upon us and it’s large and diverse,” said Huang during an earnings call.

You can opt out anytime. Nvidia’s quarterly revenue jumped 94 percent to $35 billion while net income more than doubled to $19.3 billion. Before the A.I. boom, Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) were most used by the gaming industry. Today, the company’s data center business, which serves mostly A.I. clients, accounts for nearly 90 percent of its total revenue, bringing in $30.7 billion for the quarter compared with $14.5 billion last year. Gaming revenue, meanwhile, totaled at $3.2 billion. The rest of the company’s sales came from its automotive and professional visualization departments. Huang said demand for Nvidia’s new Blackwell GPUs, which began shipping this month, “is very strong” and production is “in full steam.” In recent months, Nvidia has struggled to meet demand for its Hopper chips. Despite a blowout quarter, Nvidia’s share price slipped nearly 2 percent after the earnings release. Some investors were spooked by the chipmaker’s $37.5 billion revenue forecast for the fourth quarter, which would represent a slowdown in the rapid growth witnessed during past quarters. The “conservative revenue forecast” is “a touch disappointing,” said Kathleen Brooks, an analyst at broker XTB, in an investor note. The company’s customer base is also increasingly concentrated. Cloud service providers, which include the likes of Amazon Web Services, accounted for around half of Nvidia’s data center revenue, compared with 45 percent during the same period a year ago. Nvidia’s reliance on this sector “could be a mild cause of concern” going forward, according to Brooks. While some players in the tech industry have also raised concerns that A.I. model improvements are hitting a plateau, Huang remains optimistic about their scaling potential. “Pre-training scaling is intact and its continuing,” said the CEO, adding that test-time compute research has also emerged as an additional and promising method of scaling. “As a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great.” Nvidia expects the A.I. hype will only continue as society embraces the technology. Besides predicting that machine learning will eventually replace coding, Huang noted that data centers around the world are being modernized into “A.I. factories” that will generate A.I. “just like we’ve generated electricity.” The early foundations of an A.I.-driven world are already evident in developments like the adoption of A.I. agents across workplaces and breakthroughs across physical A.I., said Huang. “We expect this growth, this modernization, and the creation of a new industry to go on for several more years.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Inflation Data Unwinds Some of the Post-Election Rally Stocks soared on 11/6/24 on investor optimism that the incoming Trump administration would issue business-friendly policies including relaxed regulations and additional tax cuts. The rally has since partly reversed, however, on still warm inflation data that underscores the difficulty in getting to the Fed's 2% inflation. Investors are also assessing the risk that new higher tariffs, cuts on income taxes on overtime and Social Security, and deportation of low-wage workers might reverse inflation progress to date. The clear Trump victory and House and Senate sweep mean that the president will have legislative support to enact his agenda. The CPI and PPI reports suggest that inflation could remain an ongoing challenge for the new administration. October CPI and PPI On 11/13/24, the Bureau of Labor Statistic within the Labor Department reported that the all-items consumer price index (CPI) for October increased 0.2% on a month-over-month basis. That increase was in line with both the September increase and with the consensus forecast for October. While 0.2% was expected, investors are frustrated that the monthly change has not ticked down to 0.1% or even 0.0%. Investor concerns centered on the annual change of 2.6% in consumer prices. The annual change matched the 2.6% consensus call but represented an increase from the 2.4% annual change reported for September 2024. Excluding food and energy, 'core' CPI rose 0.3% month over month and 3.3% year over year. Both the monthly change and the annual change in core CPI were in line with consensus expectations and level with prior-month readings. Producer prices capture data from further up the production chain and may indicate what consumers will face in coming months. While the CPI readings showed inflation stalled in place, the producer price index (PPI) indicated some backsliding on prices. For October, the all-items PPI rose 0.2%. Although that was in line with consensus, it was worse than the revised September PPI change of 0.1% (originally reported as 0.0%). On a year-over-year basis, the October all-items PPI rose 2.2%. That was a tick better than the 2.3% consensus forecast but was up from a revised 1.9% annual change for September (originally reported as 1.8%). There are two variants on core PPI: excluding food and energy, and excluding food, energy, and trade services. Ex food and energy, core PPI for October was up 0.3% month over month and 2.3% year over year. These changes represented higher monthly and annual inflation than was reported in September while matching pre-reporting consensus expectations. PPI excluding food, energy and trade services was up 0.3% monthly and 3.5% annually; both were worse than the 0.2% monthly change and the 3.2% annual change reported for September. Investor Takeaways Investors had two key takeaways from the CPI and PPI data, both all-items and core. The first was a reminder that getting through the 'last mile' of inflation to the Fed's 2% target remains challenging. Consumer inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The decline from that peak was initially rapid, but progress on inflation has been difficult to measure in the recent months and even the past year. The annual change in the October 2023 CPI was 3.4%, meaning it has taken a year to whittle inflation down by about one percentage point. The most stubborn components in October CPI remain related to services. According to the BLS, the index for shelter (meaning rents and rent equivalents) within the CPI rose 0.4% month over month and accounted for more than half of the monthly all-items increase. Shelter not only remains stubbornly elevated; it accounts for nearly one-third of the total consumer price index. Other CPI components have a smaller weighting but showed a worse trend. Used car and light truck prices unexpectedly shot higher by 2.7% from September, after posting negative changes over the June-August period. Another non-goods component, electricity services, rose 1.2% for October; this category too was subdued in the summer months. The second key takeaway is that neither the PPI nor the CPI is likely to prevent the Fed from enacting a 25-bps rate cut at its December meeting. But investor conviction that the Fed will end the year with a quarter-point cut is by no means as strong as it was a month ago. The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) at its September meeting and by 25 basis points at its October meeting. The October cut brought the central tendency in the fed funds rate to 4.5%-4.75%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to conduct its final meeting of the year on December 17 and 18. According to the CME Fed Watch tool as of 11/18/24, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting is 58%. The probability of the Fed leaving rates unchanged is 42%. No other outcome - a shock rate hike, or a 50-bps cut - earned even a percentage point of probability. A month ago, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting was 77%; and the probability of no cut was 22%. The Industrial Economy: Sentiment vs. Reality Recent data from the industrial economy supports the view that manufacturers would benefit from a lower rate environment. Industrial production for October slipped by 0.3%, after declining by the same amount in September. Industrial production aggregates manufacturing, mining and utility output. This indicator has softened in 2024 mainly due to weakness in mining, reflecting depressed demand from the world's biggest commodity consumer (China), and mixed trends in utility output due to mild weather. In October, both utility (up 0.7%) and mining output (up 0.3%) ticked higher, but manufacturing output declined by 0.5%. The Federal Re GOOG GOOGL BABA SPG TRI

Title: Nvidia reports solid Q3, stock down as guidance underwhelms lofty expectations

Investing.com - Nvidia reported fiscal third-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street estimates, but its current-quarter guidance underwhelmed lofty investor expectations amid red-hot AI demand. The company forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares initially fell roughly 3% in premarket trading Thursday, but rebounded 0.9% into positive territory after the market opened. The company announced Q3 earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.75 on revenue of $33.09B Data center revenue was $30.8B, up 17% from Q2 and up 112% from a year ago. That compared with estimates for $28.84B. Looking ahead to Q4, revenue is expected to be $37.5B, plus or minus 2%, compared with estimates of $37.09B. GAAP gross margins were expected to be 73.0%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Commenting on the print, Bank of America analysts said they "expect [the] stock to churn near-term as investors digest lack of “sizzle” but we continue to like the stock on its “substance”. They note that Nvidia remains the fastest-growing mega-cap company and the undisputed leader in converting $1 trillion of legacy infrastructure to accelerated systems, and continues to generate solid free cash flow (FCF). Separately, Piper Sandler analysts said Nvidia's report, despite missing elevated guidance expectations, sets up the chipmaker "for extremely strong growth starting in April." "The key here is that NVDA is going through a product transition with Blackwell ramping and H200 remaining strong," analysts led by Harsh V. Kumar wrote. "We also continue to believe that starting April, the beat cadence will be quite a bit higher than the $2B cadence NVDA has more or less maintained thus far," they added. Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, which some believe represent the next frontier for the company, are expected to face supply constraints amid red-hot demand. "Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026," Nvidia said on Wednesday.

NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record revenue of $35.1 billion for Q3, up 17% sequentially and 94% year-on-year, surpassing their outlook of $32.5 billion. Data center revenue reached a record $30.8 billion, with a 17% sequential increase and 112% year-on-year growth, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper and H200 products. NVIDIA's AI enterprise revenue is expected to more than double from last year, with a growing pipeline and annualizing software service and support revenue at $1.5 billion, projected to exceed $2 billion by year-end. The company is experiencing significant demand for its new Blackwell GPUs, with plans to exceed previous revenue estimates and ramp up supply to meet customer needs. NVIDIA's gaming revenue increased by 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year, supported by strong back-to-school sales and healthy channel inventory. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces supply constraints in gaming, which are expected to impact Q4 revenue despite strong sell-through in Q3. Gross margins are expected to moderate to the low 70s as Blackwell ramps up, with initial configurations potentially impacting profitability. Networking revenue was sequentially down, despite strong year-on-year growth, indicating potential challenges in meeting demand for networking components. The company anticipates competitive market conditions in China due to export controls, which could affect future data center revenue from the region. There are concerns about potential digestion phases in hardware deployment cycles, which could impact growth as the market adjusts to new technologies. Q: Can you discuss the debate around whether scaling for large language models has stalled and how NVIDIA is addressing this? A: Jensen Huang, President and CEO, explained that foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and continuing. NVIDIA is helping customers with post-training scaling and inference time scaling, which are driving demand for their infrastructures. The next generation of models starts with 100,000 Blackwells, indicating strong industry movement. Q: There were reports about heating issues with Blackwell. Can you address concerns about your ability to execute the roadmap with Ultra and Rubin? A: Jensen Huang assured that Blackwell production is in full steam, with more units being delivered than previously estimated. The supply chain is robust, and NVIDIA is on track with its annual roadmap, focusing on performance improvements and reducing AI costs. Q: How is Blackwell expected to ramp this year, and how will it affect gross margins? A: Colette Kress, CFO, stated that Blackwell will ramp with initial gross margins in the low 70s, improving to mid-70s as production scales. Jensen Huang added that Blackwell shipments will increase each quarter, with significant demand driven by shifts in computing from CPUs to GPUs. Q: Could NVIDIA recover to mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar '25? A: Colette Kress confirmed that reaching mid-70s gross margin in the second half of next year is a reasonable assumption, depending on the mix of ramp. Q: Can you provide an update on Sovereign AI demand and explain the supply constraints in gaming? A: Colette Kress noted that Sovereign AI demand remains strong, with growth opportunities in regional clouds and AI factories. Gaming supply constraints are due to fast sell-through and efforts to ramp up supply, expected to improve in the new calendar year.

Despite the strong performance, shares dipped more than 2% in after-hours trading, reflecting investor caution over valuation and tempered guidance. The chipmaker posted revenue of $35.08 billion for the quarter ended October 27, a 94% increase year-on-year and beating analysts’ consensus estimate of $33.28 billion. Nvidia’s non-GAAP earnings-per-share came in at $0.81, surpassing consensus estimates of $0.75 EPS. Revenue from the Data Center segment, Nvidia’s key growth driver, reached a record $30.8 billion, up 112% from the same period last year. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder and CEO, called the quarter a reflection of “AI in full steam” as enterprises adopt Nvidia’s Hopper GPUs and anticipate the launch of its next-generation Blackwell platform. The tech giant has been riding high this year following an explosion of investor interest in AI-related firms and businesses. That has helped drive the Nasdaq to record heights amid prospects of a return to cheaper borrowing should the U.S. Federal Reserve continue to slash its benchmark rate. Despite strong results, Nvidia’s stock fell 0.76% during regular trading and dropped another 2.39% in after-hours, closing at $142.40. Analysts attributed the decline to profit-taking after Nvidia's year-long rally, along with cautious reactions to the company’s Q4 guidance. Nvidia expects revenue of $37.5 billion for the next quarter, representing a 7% sequential increase and aligning with analyst forecasts. Nvidia’s gaming segment also saw steady growth, reporting $3.3 billion in revenue, up 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. However, smaller segments like Automotive and Professional Visualization, while growing, contributed modestly to overall revenue. While results underscore Nvidia's dominance in the AI and accelerated computing space, concerns over the company’s soaring valuation and supply constraints for its GPUs could weigh on the stock in the short term. Nvidia will hold a conference call with analysts later Wednesday to provide further insights into its outlook.

Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.25%) fiscal third quarter revenues beat Wall Street’s expectations for another straight quarter at a record $35.1 billion — up 94% from a year ago. The chipmaker’s revenues for the quarter ended in October are up 17% from the previous quarter’s revenues of $30 billion. Nvidia reported net income of $19.3 billion, and earnings per share, or EPS, of $0.78. “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing,” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference.” Nvidia was expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.60%). Net income was expected to be $17.4 billion and EPS was expected at $0.75. Shares of the chipmaker were down 0.76% at the market close on Wednesday. Nvidia’s shares are up 202.86% so far this year. The company’s data center quarterly revenue was $30.8 billion, up 17% from the previous quarter, and up 112% year over year. Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company was expected to set fiscal fourth quarter guidance at $37.09 billion, according to FactSet estimates. “To support the stock on earnings day,” Nvidia would have to report fiscal fourth quarter guidance of at least $38 billion, John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz ahead of earnings. On an earnings call with analysts, the company said that it shipped thirteen thousand Blackwell samples in the fiscal third quarter, and that the artificial intelligence platform is in full production. In response to an analyst’s questions about reports of Blackwell overheating and Nvidia’s roadmap to produce AI chips on a one year cycle, Huang said that the company plans to deliver more Blackwells in the current quarter than previously estimated, and that “as you see from all the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.” “We’re expecting to continue to execute on our annual road map,” Huang said. “Everything is on track as far as I know. Nvidia’s shares were down 3.47% during after-hours trading on Wednesday after it released its earnings results. The shares remained down by 1.2% later in the evening. The chipmaker’s shares fell 6.9% in after-hours trading after it reported fiscal second quarter earnings in August. Nvidia had set fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — slightly above the average analysts were expecting, but below top end estimates.

Q3 Fiscal 2025 Summary *All per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the ten-for-one stock split, which was effective June 7, 2024. OutlookNVIDIA’s outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is as follows: Highlights NVIDIA achieved progress since its previous earnings announcement in these areas: Data Center Gaming and AI PC Professional Visualization Automotive and Robotics CFO CommentaryCommentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com. Conference Call and Webcast InformationNVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2025. Non-GAAP MeasuresTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.78, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.81, up 19% from the previous quarter and up 103% from a year ago. “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference. “AI is transforming every industry, company and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI. And countries have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI and infrastructure,” he said. NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on December 27, 2024, to all shareholders of record on December 5, 2024. Q3 Fiscal 2025 Summary *All per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the ten-for-one stock split, which was effective June 7, 2024. Outlook NVIDIA’s outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is as follows: Highlights NVIDIA achieved progress since its previous earnings announcement in these areas: Data Center Gaming and AI PC Professional Visualization Automotive and Robotics CFO Commentary Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com. Conference Call and Webcast Information NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2025. Non-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from steep losses Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, a crucial litmus test for the artificial intelligence trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the day up about 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed flat. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.1%. All three major indexes had been deep in the red at some point in the day, with the Nasdaq down over 1% in morning trading. After the bell, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion but shares slipped early in after-hours trading. The $3.61 trillion chipmaker, now the world's most valuable company, had seen its stock surge 200% this year so far, hitting record highs after the US presidential election. Elsewhere in corporates, Target (TGT) muted its outlook for holiday-season sales and profit after posting a big quarterly profit miss and slashing its full-year guidance. The retail giant's shares sank more than 21% after the earnings. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were up more than 3% to hit a fresh record near $94,500 per token before paring back some gains and falling below $94,000. Optimism for a crypto-friendly Trump White House has spurred the digital currency's recent rally. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trade after the company reported quarterly results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. For the third quarter, Nvidia reported earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Wall Street had expected earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia shares had been up nearly 200% heading into the print. Target (TGT) stock fell more than 21% on Wednesday after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. The Wednesday tumble marked the stock's worst one-day performance since May 2022. Read more about Target's quarter here. Homebuilder stocks are losing steam. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) has fallen nearly 5% in the past month. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder, along with Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM), have seen declines of more than 12%, 6%, and 11% in the past month, respectively. “It's not surprising and not really alarming that the group is giving some of its [gains] back,” Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless told Yahoo Finance. “When you look at what mortgage rates have done in the past month, basically since the beginning of the calendar 4Q, these stocks tend to trade in an inverse fashion of what mortgage rates are doing.” Rates on the 30-year mortgages have been hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac, up from around 6% in September. Meanwhile, lumber prices have been climbing, with the framing lumber composite price rising 1.4% for the week ending Nov. 15, reaching the highest level since August 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders. “It just may be a little more expensive from a lumber perspective for the builders than what they were paying this time last year," McCanless said. Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings report is set for release after the closing bell. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley breaks down the key numbers and themes to watch: Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines compared to the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3 but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Read more of the preview here. Shares of the chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) dropped 6.6% following its investor day, which focused on how the company will diversify revenue just as its business with Apple (AAPL) falls into jeopardy. Qualcomm discussed further diversifying revenue beyond its smartphone chips to chips for personal computers, autos, and a range of advanced systems from machinery in factories to surveillance technology (dubbed its "Internet of Things" segment). Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman reports that the company expects to generate $22 billion in sales of those semiconductors by 2029. Currently about 10% of Qualcomm's revenue comes from sales of its modem chips to Apple for the iPhone, but that business has come under pressure as Apple increasingly develops its own custom chips for the devices. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke with Yahoo Finance about what's ahead for the company Tuesday afternoon. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings after the bell and give investors another look at the state of AI spending. The stock is already up nearly 200% this year, and more than 2,600% in the past five years as the company's revenues have run wild amid a surge in demand for its AI chips. In a media roundtable on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin made the case that it may be time for investors to look elsewhere to benefit from the AI boom. Nvidia's liftoff was "phase one" of the AI trade, Kostin said. The "AI infrastructure" trade, companies that will help power the AI boom and are spending on AI chips to operate new servers, has already taken off too, in some cases beyond their projected earnings growth, per Kostin. But the prices of stocks in Goldman's "AI enabled revenue" group haven't seen the same reaction. This group, Kostin said, could benefit from not having to spend as much on expensive AI hardware but still reap the potential benefits from AI as a whole. The group includes stocks like Uber (UBER), Adobe (ADBE), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM), and more. "We at companies in the AI enabled revenue group of stocks where their performance of the shares have basically matched their earnings growth," Kostin said. "And so our analysis is there's a potential for multiple expansion in those stocks." Williams-Sonoma (WSM) shares soared roughly 30% after the company reported third quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and boosted its outlook for the full year. The high-end retailer — which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm in addition to its namesake, Williams-Sonoma — also said it's prepared to deal with potential upcoming tariffs under president-elect Donald Trump. CFO Jeffrey Howie said, "We've significantly reduced our China-sourced goods from 50% to 25% over the last few years. So our exposure is significantly less than the last time in 2018 that we saw this activity." "The US is already a major manufacturing hub for Williams-Sonoma, Inc.," he added. "Much of our upholstery is manufactured domestically in our facilities in North Carolina and Mississippi." Howie continued, "We're prepared to reduce our exports to China further if tariffs increase. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if conditions warrant, and we're currently evaluating and quantifying the impact from additional tariffs. We have a wide range of mitigation options." Owning a home is becoming increasingly more expensive than renting one. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Exact cost estimates vary, but recently the premium for homeownership has been at least 35% over renting, a level that’s near historical highs and is likely to persist. “We’re well, well beyond what the typical historical difference is if you were to buy an entry-level home versus rent a starter home,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. “I think that’s a big part of why you see the resale market in a recession.” Palacios’s firm has found factors like rising homeowners insurance premiums explain much of the growing gap. Higher mortgage rates don’t help either. Leaving other factors constant, it would take mortgage rates to be at 3.5% for the buying versus renting math to return to historical averages.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman expressed concern that the Fed’s progress toward 2% inflation has “stalled” and the central bank should proceed "cautiously" when lowering interest rates. Bowman was the lone official to dissent when the Fed slashed the rate by half a percentage point, saying then that the Fed should've cut interest rates by 25 basis points instead of 50. On Wednesday, she argued there are "greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor market remains near full employment." "We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months," Bowman said in a speech at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. To Bowman's point, last week the "core" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. Recent data has increased debate over whether or not the Fed will cut rates in December. As of Wednesday afternoon, markets are pricing in a roughly 56% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, down from a more than 82% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has soared about 40% since Donald Trump won the presidential election to trade above $94,000 per coin for the first time on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told Yahoo Finance why the market has been betting the new administration will be more pro cryptocurrency. "All the guys around the table like our space," Novogratz said. "They believe in the digital asset world. They believe in blockchains and bitcoin. And so the whole energy of this administration is going to be so different than the Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler era." Novogratz added that he expects an administration that's more supportive of crypto will help US crypto business operate without the "fear of litigation." And for company's like Novogratz's it could help cut down on costs too. "Our audit at Galaxy cost three times what it would if we were a non-crypto company," Novogratz said. "So we're spending $9 million a year on an audit for a medium-sized company. That's insane. So the tax on crypto has been brutal. That is going to come way down. People aren't going to fear ... they're constantly getting a Wells notice." Brutal day for Target (TGT) after earnings. Here are three problems I saw in the quarter. I wasn't the only one spotting these things, of course. The Citi research team swooping in with a midday downgrade on Target (a late one at that). "We are downgrading Target from buy to neutral. Though 3Q may have had some unique challenges, we believe very poor results at Target in 3Q (and an uninspiring outlook for 4Q) show Target is likely losing share to Walmart (WMT). With Walmart's market share gains coming largely from higher income consumers (as they called out yesterday), Target seems to be the one most at risk of losing additional share. We believe Target is likely to need to be more promotional to drive traffic/sales, which we believe makes fiscal year 2025 much more uncertain, especially because in 3Q Target did not show an ability to adjust SG&A to offset the sales/gross margin weakness," said Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. Bottom line: It's going to take Target several quarters to regain investor trust. It could begin to do that by delivering on its severely lowered holiday quarter guidance. Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) are the latest American retailers to warn that product costs could rise if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on his tariff promises — which include 10% to 20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Walmart CFO John David Rainey hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi on Tuesday that Trump’s tariff promises would prompt the retailer to hike costs, pointing to the impact of higher tariffs enacted during the president-elect's first term under his “America First” agenda. “If we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,” Rainey said. Lowe's echoed the sentiment. “Roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the US, and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners,” said CFO Brandon Sink in a call with investors on Tuesday. “And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point.” Read the full story here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Expectations — as they have been for more than a year now — are monstrous. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Both metrics would mark a more than 80% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago. Nvidia has been consistently surpassing analyst estimates every quarter since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022. The AI chip leader's stock reaction has been more mixed in the day following earnings announcements as expectations have grown lofty, but it hasn't fallen two quarters in a row on the day following its earnings release since the middle of 2021. That could change during Thursday's trading day if Nvidia has a repeat of last quarter when the company's upbeat outlook wasn't enough to impress investors and the stock fell more than 6%. "The company hasn’t had a negative price reaction in back to back post earnings release days since [the first quarter of 2021], when GenAI wasn’t a phrase in investors’ dictionary," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. "A positive reaction following the 11/20 release, following the negative move last quarter, could help cushion the S&P 500’s decline somewhat near term but is more likely to refocus investors on the long term story." Target (TGT) stock tanked in early trading on Wednesday, falling more than 20% after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. Before the bell, Target said it now expects full-year earnings per share in a range of $8.30 to $8.90, below its prior range of $9.00 to $9.70. The new guidance also came in well below the $9.61 earnings per share that Wall Street had expected. The retailer also took a cautious stance on prospects for the holiday shopping season. Read more on Target's quarter from Yahoo Finance Executive editor Brian Sozzi here. US stocks wavered on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the AI trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flat line. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.2%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. After surging on Tuesday amid increased optimism surrounding the stock ahead of earnings, Nvidia shares slid more than 1% in early trade. Comcast (CMCSA) is looking to play offense in the ever-evolving media landscape. On Wednesday, the company said that it will spin off most of its cable networks into a new publicly traded company called SpinCo. The stock jumped as much as 3.5% in premarket trading before paring those gains. The new venture will house the majority of NBCUniversal’s cable television networks, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel. Those networks collectively generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Comcast said in its announcement. Comcast's Peacock streaming service and the NBC broadcast network will remain under the parent company. “This transaction positions both SpinCo and NBCUniversal to play offense in a changing media landscape,” said Comcast president Mike Cavanagh.

Title: Investors want to see a 'bullish' Nvidia in its earnings, analyst says

After reporting record earnings for its fiscal second quarter on Aug. 30, Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.25%) shares tumbled after investors were left unimpressed by its guidance for the fiscal third quarter. With Nvidia’s fiscal third quarter results coming imminently, those expectations are still “incredibly high,” Daniel Newman, chief executive of The Futurum Group, told Quartz. “We know from the last quarter what happens if they are too conservative,” Newman said. “People want to see it be bullish.” Nvidia is still in the cycle where expectations are palpable and meeting expectations is not enough — investors want to hear a beat, Newman said. The chipmaker is expected to set fiscal fourth quarter guidance at $37.09 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.60%). “To support the stock on earnings day,” Nvidia will have to report fiscal fourth quarter guidance of at least $38 billion, John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz. Investors are also expecting updates on Blackwell, both Belton and Newman said, separately, amid reports that the highly-anticipated artificial intelligence chips are overheating when connected on custom-designed server racks that combine 72 of the company’s GPUs, or graphics processing units. However, Dell (DELL+3.69%) said it has started shipping Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 server racks, and Microsoft (MSFT+0.41%) announced a private preview of the Blackwell AI infrastructure on its Azure cloud computing platform. Blackwell experienced production and shipping delays earlier this year due to a design flaw that was fixed, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in October, after media reports about the issue surfaced in August. Before Huang addressed the design flaw, Nvidia’s shares got a boost after he said Blackwell was in full production and demand for the chip was “insane.” “People want confirmation on Blackwell and margin integrity,” Newman said, adding that Blackwell revenue will come into play during the next earnings cycle. “People want to see how much enthusiasm there is,” and if the numbers can provide a positive outlook that the market wants to hear. Nvidia has already announced its next-generation AI chip platform, Rubin, which will come after Blackwell in 2026. The Rubin platform will include new GPUs and a new central processing unit (CPU) called Vera, as well as advanced networking chips. During the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker is “on a one-year rhythm” with producing new chips. Investors will want to hear Nvidia’s roadmap for Rubin and if it can sustain its annual cycle, as well as whether its small but mighty customer base can continue buying at a fast rate while delivering returns, Newman said. Additionally, investors will be interested in Nvidia’s ability to keep its 92% share of the data center GPU market, including its plans to maintain pricing power and growth on the path to a $4 trillion valuation. Meanwhile, “Nvidia’s foray into the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space is a positive,” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, said in comments shared with Quartz. “Notably, Nvidia’s focus on incorporating AI into the cockpit for infotainment systems is allowing it to grow its autonomous driving revenues.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia and the rest of the Magnificent 7 create a risky scenario for the market, strategist says

Andrew Krei, co-chief investment officer at Crescent Grove Advisors, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Sometimes even when they surpass expectations, the markets are unhappy, do they have to have blow out earnings for the markets to react positively? ANDREW KREI (AK): It speaks to the idea that whether you look at the valuation or the assumptions that go into Nvidia’s (NVDA) price are ultimately a high bar, right? The market is expecting that this AI growth theme continues for quite some period of time, that Nvidia continues to capture a large portion of market share, that their margins stay very healthy where they are now. And if there’s any sign that that story or that narrative is breaking in, in some way, shape, or form, then I think again, investors look at this with a very high bar. If Nvidia can’t exceed that bar, to your point, there’s disappointment around that. And I think it speaks to the broader AI theme as well. And some of the other companies that have been the poster children, the Magnificent Seven, those mega-cap tech names that have benefited from that narrative, just this idea that going forward, valuations are really demanding. Expectations are really demanding in terms of what investors are looking for around their execution on these themes. If they don’t meet those high bars going forward, they can’t exceed those, then that’s where you see the knee-jerk reaction of people selling off these stocks because that uncertainty starts to exist to a greater degree than where it has been before. AM: The majority of the growth in the indexes has been in the Mag Seven over the last couple of years. What risk does such market concentration pose? AK: I would say if you look historically at episodes where you have a significant amount of concentration at the top of markets, meaning the top 10 names or so, what they represent is a percentage of the aggregate market cap. Right now we’re in the 30% range, mid-thirties, something along those lines generally doesn’t end well, right? There’s just a huge amount of piling into these names that happens from investors that you create this momentum that begets buying, begets more buying, that sort of thing. Ultimately, when there is a reversal, of course, if the narrative does start to break, again, go back to the AI theme, right? If the execution isn’t absolutely spot on going forward, when you start to extrapolate the assumptions that are built into these stocks, that’s when you can start to see a wave of capital outflows from these names. And that’s again, historically speaking, what you’ve seen now are these businesses, they’re phenomenal businesses, right? I think it’s warranted the idea that their growth has exceeded the rest of the market and they’ve again, I think, been deserving of the status to be market leaders. When you look at the relative earnings growth over the last several years from our perspective and as we look forward and we think about investors, the basic portfolio management principles that we go to, we think about diversification and sort of this idea of how do you avoid some of those concentration risks. For us, it’s taken some chips off the table, rebalancing into other segments of the market that now the earnings growth picture starts to look a little bit more favorable. The expectations are coming down a little bit for earnings growth for the likes of Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT). The Magnificent Seven and earnings growth potential is ticking up for the, let’s call it “S&P 493”, the non-Magnificent Seven names. I think gives us the specter of a potential convergence in performance going forward, if not an outright rotational opportunity for investors, relative value going from something really highly valued to something that’s more reasonably valued in the market with fundamentals now that, again, start to converge a little bit. So that to us is the way to play it. But again, it’s been deserved, I think for the Magnificent Seven to see the gains that they’ve seen. AM: So in the other, the S&P 493, are there any sectors or companies you’re looking at that investors should consider investing in? AK: How we kind of frame it up is there’s tech, there’s the Mag Seven, the mega cap tech names, and then everything else. So there’s that very, very high-level taxonomy for us, and I think we just want to be a little more focused on the everything else bucket over the next, you know, 12-plus months and thinking about that relative value, rotation opportunity. But even within that, I would say value segments of the market. So that can be things like industrials, materials can be even things like consumer staples, healthcare, just these sort of segments that have been a little bit left for dead in some respects over the last several years because their earnings have been kinda middling. The growth hasn’t quite been there to the same magnitude that the tech earnings growth has been. We just think, again, there’s an opportunity for capital to flow into those segments. In particular, if we look at that forward-looking picture for the new administration, if there is gonna be more fiscal stimulus, if there’s gonna be deregulation, financials a big piece of the value index. You look at these other segments that could benefit from this pro-cyclical type of growth backdrop that we could see going forward. And that to us represents a compelling proposition relative to, again, these tech names that have done so well and now trade at really demanding valuations.

Nvidia (NVDA) will report its third quarter earnings after the bell today, giving Wall Street its best and latest look into the strength of the artificial intelligence trade. The world’s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia’s stock price has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond. Shares of Nvidia were up 196% year to date as of Wednesday, easily outpacing any of the company’s chipmaker rivals. AMD (AMD), the closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink over 5% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge nearly 52%. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year, when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3, but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Even if the AI chip leader delivers a stellar report and outlook, its share price could still fall. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but its stock dropped 6% immediately after its results. That could be a sign that some investors weren’t impressed with Nvidia’s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains. Investors will also be looking for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company’s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production would pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips. At the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he anticipated that would continue in the year ahead. What’s more, he said the company’s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, was expected to continue selling well into Q4. Blackwell shipments have faced delays, however, and on Sunday, the Information reported that the AI chips have run into problems with overheating servers — a potential hold-up to installation in data centers. Nvidia is facing an uncertain future, given Donald Trump has threatened to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. In addition, the president-elect has raised the specter of tariffs on Taiwan-made chips. That would be a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. The vast majority of Nvidia’s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Nvidia (NVDA) reported third quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday that topped expectations on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips fueling what its CEO Jensen Huang called the "age of AI." The world’s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion. Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. Nvidia's stock price fell roughly 3% in premarket trading on Thursday, as investors weighed the forecast. “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” Huang said in a statement. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training, and inference." The chip giant's Data Center business, which makes up the vast majority of its revenue, brought in $30.8 billion in the quarter, beating out analysts' expectations of $29 billion and jumping 112% versus the $14.5 billion the segment made in Q3 last year. Nvidia's gaming revenue came in at $3.3 billion, up from the $2.8 billion the division brought in last year. Analysts were looking for $3 billion. Nvidia's stock has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond.

Nvidia also appeared to assuage concerns about potential slowdowns in the availability of its next-generation Blackwell chip, with CFO Colette Kress saying that the AI GPU will begin shipping in the current quarter and ramp into the year ahead. "Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026," she added.

Election 2024 coverage presented by This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day. CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,981.79 +0.61% Bitcoin (BTC): $93,634.61 +2.04% Ether (ETH): $3,090.71 -1.65% S&P 500: 5,916.98 +0.40% Gold: $2,628.53 -0.15% Nikkei 225: 38,352.34 -0.16% Bitcoin (BTC) is eyeing record highs once again heading into Wednesday's U.S. session. The largest crypto is trading just below $94,000, the new record from Tuesday, and leading the broader market with a 2% climb over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index was little changed and large-cap altcoins ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) fell. Options on BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw staggering first-day trading activity yesterday, pushing the BTC price higher, analysts noted. Most of the activity focused on calls, representing a bullish view, with some traders betting on a doubling of IBIT's share price. "It’s pretty interesting to see 'professionals' degen into $100 strikes (this effectively means a doubling of BTC prices given IBIT trades near $50)," crypto quant researcher Samneet Chepal noted. Options on other BTC ETFs will follow in the coming days, fueling more activity. It's not only bitcoin where the crypto action is concentrated, though. Trading volumes for popular altcoins dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP (XRP) surpassed BTC's on South Korean crypto exchanges Upbit and Bithumb. MicroStrategy (MSTR) broke into the top 100 U.S. publicly traded companies by market capitalization as its share price closed Tuesday's session at a record $430, far above its dotcom bubble highs. The firm owns the largest corporate bitcoin treasury in the world and its shares have rallied 528% this year, outperforming bitcoin and chipmaker giant Nvidia (NVDA). The developments keep coming for the firm, CoinDesk analyst James Van Straten noted. On Monday, it announced a $1.75 billion 5-year convertible senior note issuance at a 0% coupon. "We are waiting on further developments if this convertible note has been oversubscribed, which would increase its issuance by $250 million, for a total of $2 billion," Van Straten said. Robinhood (HOOD) is poised to benefit the most from crypto deregulation in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump, broker Bernstein said in a report. The trading app can drive higher revenues by listing new tokens and introducing new crypto product lines to target the wider opportunity, the report said. Robinhood's acquisition of EU-based exchange Bitstamp and its European platform should "further boost value added crypto services," the authors wrote. Bernstein raised the price target for Robinhood shares to $51 from $30, which would translate to a 45% appreciation from Tuesday's closing price. - Omkar Godbole Coinbase Delists Wrapped Bitcoin wBTC, Citing 'Listing Concerns' Crypto Exchange Archax to Offer Tokenized Money Market Funds from State Street, Fidelity International and LGIM Meta's Mark Zuckerberg Could Teach DAOs, Like Compound, a Governance Lesson Edited by Sheldon Reback.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks fell on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the artificial intelligence trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was down about 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 0.5%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.7%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. Investors are counting down to Nvidia's results after the bell, hoping the last of the "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps to report can provide some fresh momentum for stocks. It's seen as a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to the two-year bull market. The $3.61 trillion chipmaker, now the world's most valuable company, has seen its stock surge 200% this year so far, hitting record highs after the presidential election. The European Central Bank has warned of a bubble in AI stocks amid high concentration and the risk that lofty earnings hopes won't be met. Nvidia's share price was down almost 2%, after surging on Tuesday to buoy the Nasdaq to a win. Traders are bracing for a potential post-earnings swing of 8% — or $300 billion in market value — in either direction, going by options markets. Elsewhere in corporates, Target (TGT) muted its outlook for holiday-season sales and profit after posting a big quarterly profit miss and slashing its full-year guidance. The retail giant's shares sank more than 21% after the earnings. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were up more than 3% to hit a fresh record near $94,500 per token before paring back some gains and falling below $94,000. Optimism for a crypto-friendly Trump White House has spurred the digital currency's recent rally. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Homebuilder stocks are losing steam. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) has fallen nearly 5% in the past month. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder, along with Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM) have seen declines of more than 12%, 6% and 11% in the past month, respectively. “It's not surprising and not really alarming that the group is giving some of its [gains] back,” Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless told Yahoo Finance. “When you look at what mortgage rates have done in the past month, basically since the beginning of the calendar 4Q, these stocks tend to trade in an inverse fashion of what mortgage rates are doing.” Rates on the 30-year mortgages have been hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac, up from around 6% in September. Meanwhile, lumber prices have been climbing, with the framing lumber composite price rising 1.4% for the week ending Nov. 15, reaching the highest level since August 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders. “It just may be a little more expensive from a lumber perspective for the builders than what they were paying this time last year," McCanless said. Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings report is set for release after the closing bell. Yahoo Finance's dan Howley breaks down the key numbers and themes to watch: Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines compared to the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3 but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Read more of the preview here. Shares of the chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) dropped 6.6% following its investor day, which focused on how the company will diversify revenue just as its business with Apple (AAPL) falls into jeopardy. Qualcomm discussed further diversifying revenue beyond its smartphone chips to chips for personal computers, autos, and a range of advanced systems from machinery in factories to surveillance technology (dubbed its "Internet of Things" segment). Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman reports that the company expects to generate $22 billion in sales of those semiconductors by 2029. Currently about 10% of Qualcomm's revenue comes from sales of its modem chips to Apple for the iPhone, but that business has come under pressure as Apple increasingly develops its own custom chips for the devices. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke with Yahoo Finance about what's ahead for the company Tuesday afternoon. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings after the bell and give investors another look at the state of AI spending. The stock is already up nearly 200% this year, and more than 2,600% in the past five years as the company's revenues have run wild amid a surge in demand for its AI chips. In a media roundtable on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin made the case that it may be time for investors to look elsewhere to benefit from the AI boom. Nvidia's liftoff was "phase one" of the AI trade, Kostin said. The "AI infrastructure" trade, companies that will help power the AI boom and are spending on AI chips to operate new servers has already taken off too, in some cases beyond their projected earnings growth, per Kostin. But the price of stocks in Goldman's "AI enabled revenue" group haven't seen the same reaction. This group Kostin said could benefit from not having to spend as much on expensive AI hardware but still reap the potential benefits from AI as a whole. The group includes stocks like Uber (UBER), Adobe (ADBE), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM) and more. "We at companies in the AI enabled revenue group of stocks where their performance of the shares have basically matched their earnings growth," Kostin said. "And so our analysis is there's a potential for multiple expansion in those stocks." Williams-Sonoma (WSM) shares soared roughly 30% after the company reported third quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and boosted its outlook for the full year. The high-end retailer — which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm in addition to its namesake, Williams-Sonoma — also said it's prepared to deal with potential upcoming tariffs under president-elect Donald Trump. CFO Jeffrey Howie said: "[W]e've significantly reduced our China-sourced goods from 50% to 25% over the last few years. So our exposure is significantly less than the last time in 2018 that we saw this activity." "The US is already a major manufacturing hub for Williams-Sonoma Inc," he added. "Much of our upholstery is manufactured domestically in our facilities in North Carolina and Mississippi." Howie continued: "We're prepared to reduce our exports to China further if tariffs increase. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if conditions warrant, and we're currently evaluating and quantifying the impact from additional tariffs. We have a wide range of mitigation options." Owning a home is becoming increasingly more expensive than renting one. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Exact cost estimates vary, but recently the premium for homeownership has been at least 35% over renting, a level that’s near historical highs and is likely to persist. “We’re well, well beyond what the typical historical difference is if you were to buy an entry-level home versus rent a starter home,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. “I think that’s a big part of why you see the resale market in a recession.” Palacios’s firm has found factors like rising homeowners insurance premiums explain much of the growing gap. Higher mortgage rates don’t help either. Leaving other factors constant, it would take mortgage rates to be at 3.5% for the buying versus renting math to return to historical averages.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman expressed concern that the Fed’s progress toward 2% inflation has “stalled” and the central bank should proceed "cautiously" when lowering interest rates. Bowman was the lone official to dissent when the Fed slashed the rate by half a percentage point, saying then that the Fed should've cut interest rates by 25 basis points instead of 50. On Wednesday, she argued there are "greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor market remains near full employment." "We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months," Bowman said in a speech at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. To Bowman's point, last week the "core" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. Recent data has increased debate over whether or not the Fed will cut rates in December. As of Wednesday afternoon, markets are pricing in a roughly 56% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, down from a more than 82% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has soared about 40% since Donald Trump won the presidential election to trade above $94,000 per coin for the first time on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told Yahoo Finance why the market has been betting the new administration will be more pro cryptocurrency. "All the guys around the table like our space," Novogratz said. "They believe in the digital asset world. They believe in blockchains and bitcoin. And so the whole energy of this administration is going to be so different than the Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler era." Novogratz added that he expects an administration that's more supportive of crypto will help US crypto business operate without the "fear of litigation." And for company's like Novogratz's it could help cut down on costs too. "Our audit at Galaxy cost three times what it would if we were a non-crypto company," Novogratz said. "So we're spending $9 million a year on an audit for a medium-sized company. That's insane. So the tax on crypto has been brutal. That is going to come way down. People aren't going to fear ... they're constantly getting a Wells notice." Brutal day for Target (TGT) after earnings. Here are three problems I saw in the quarter. I wasn't the only one spotting these things, of course. The Citi research team swooping in with a midday downgrade on Target (a late one at that). "We are downgrading Target from buy to neutral. Though 3Q may have had some unique challenges, we believe very poor results at Target in 3Q (and an uninspiring outlook for 4Q) show Target is likely losing share to Walmart (WMT). With Walmart's market share gains coming largely from higher income consumers (as they called out yesterday), Target seems to be the one most at risk of losing additional share. We believe Target is likely to need to be more promotional to drive traffic/sales, which we believe makes fiscal year 2025 much more uncertain, especially because in 3Q Target did not show an ability to adjust SG&A to offset the sales/gross margin weakness," said Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. Bottom line: It's going to take Target several quarters to regain investor trust. It could begin to do that by delivering on its severely lowered holiday quarter guidance. Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) are the latest American retailers to warn that product costs could rise if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on his tariff promises — which include 10% to 20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Walmart CFO John David Rainey hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi on Tuesday that Trump’s tariff promises would prompt the retailer to hike costs, pointing to the impact of higher tariffs enacted during the president-elect's first term under his “America First” agenda. “If we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,” Rainey said. Lowe's echoed the sentiment. “Roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the US, and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners,” said CFO Brandon Sink in a call with investors on Tuesday. “And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point.” Read the full story here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Expectations — as they have been for more than a year now — are monstrous. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Both metrics would mark a more than 80% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago. Nvidia has been consistently surpassing analyst estimates every quarter since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022. The AI chip leader's stock reaction has been more mixed in the day following earnings announcements as expectations have grown lofty, but it hasn't fallen two quarters in a row on the day following its earnings release since the middle of 2021. That could change during Thursday's trading day if Nvidia has a repeat of last quarter when the company's upbeat outlook wasn't enough to impress investors and the stock fell more than 6%. "The company hasn’t had a negative price reaction in back to back post earnings release days since [the first quarter of 2021], when GenAI wasn’t a phrase in investors’ dictionary," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. "A positive reaction following the 11/20 release, following the negative move last quarter, could help cushion the S&P 500’s decline somewhat near term but is more likely to refocus investors on the long term story." Target (TGT) stock tanked in early trading on Wednesday, falling more than 20% after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. Before the bell, Target said it now expects full-year earnings per share in a range of $8.30 to $8.90, below its prior range of $9.00 to $9.70. The new guidance also came in well below the $9.61 earnings per share that Wall Street had expected. The retailer also took a cautious stance on prospects for the holiday shopping season. Read more on Target's quarter from Yahoo Finance Executive editor Brian Sozzi here. US stocks wavered on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the AI trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flat line. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.2%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. After surging on Tuesday amid increased optimism surrounding the stock ahead of earnings, Nvidia shares slid more than 1% in early trade. Comcast (CMCSA) is looking to play offense in the ever-evolving media landscape. On Wednesday, the company said that it will spin off most of its cable networks into a new publicly traded company called SpinCo. The stock jumped as much as 3.5% in premarket trading before paring those gains. The new venture will house the majority of NBCUniversal’s cable television networks, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel. Those networks collectively generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Comcast said in its announcement. Comcast's Peacock streaming service and the NBC broadcast network will remain under the parent company. “This transaction positions both SpinCo and NBCUniversal to play offense in a changing media landscape,” said Comcast president Mike Cavanagh.

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Chip stocks are down 3% since the election. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure. Once the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months. Nvidia (NVDA) earnings — coming after the bell Wednesday — will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally. Tom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday. "It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance," said Essaye. "It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print." Nvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock — up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years — hit record highs following the election. But many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year. The worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor — is down 14%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous. To be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday. "Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally]," said Essaye. Since the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia — "priced to perfection" according to many analysts — underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning. But Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this "bellwether" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years. "They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far," he said. "I think they can do it again."

Nvidia’s stock broke to all-time highs recently, trading at $148 in early November and $147 yesterday. The stock has left many investors wondering “what comes next” after the unrelenting, historic surge that began seven quarters ago. To help my readers determine where Nvidia’s stock will go next, I’ve been fastidious in my analysis about the company’s outsized AI potential since 2018, tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for AI demand since 2022, discussing the anomalous earnings and revenue revisions throughout 2023 and 2024, and reporting on never-before published data on supply chain checks as recent as two months ago. CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, waves during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm ... [+] Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark, on October 23, 2024. The new AI supercomputer has been established in collaboration with EIFO and NVIDIA and is operated by the Danish Center for AI Innovation (DCAI). The computer is aimed 'at breakthroughs in quantum computing, clean energy, biotechnology and other areas serving Danish society and the world', according to Nvidia. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) The thoroughness is needed, however, as rumors from the media and short sellers alike run amuck. Rest assured, as 2025 approaches, supply chain data is giving bullish signals that the new generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined. Regarding my firm’s confidence in tracking supply chain data, when The Information stated Nvidia was experiencing a material delay on the next generation of GPUs, going so far as to state that Taiwan Semiconductor had machines sitting idle, I quickly refuted the report based on supply chain data my firm had been tracking. Those data points continue to indicate Blackwell is ramping. Here is what I stated: “As of now, there’s a disconnect between next fiscal year’s revenue estimates of $167 billion and the $210 billion in GB200s alone expected to ship next year. Perhaps analysts are waiting for signals the supply chain can produce these outsized orders. So far, so good with the signals we see from TSMC and SMCI’s most recent earnings reports. Foxconn commentary helps, as well.” Fast forward two months, and next year’s fiscal estimates stand at $185 billion up from $167 billion; showing no material impact from the delay (quite the opposite). Our firm was also able to use that same supply chain data to buy Nvidia in July/August, for an average cost basis of $109. The I/O Fund’s first trade was at $3.15, but we actively track the stock and publish our real-time trade alerts for anyone who feels they missed out on the AI juggernaut. The first item that will determine the strength of the upcoming earnings report from Nvidia has nothing to do with the Q3 results. Rather, what the market will want to know is how much Blackwell revenue is expected in the January quarter. Morgan Stanley has estimates placed at $5 to $6 billion, with this number hitting a ceiling due to supply constraints; however, Piper Sandler sees Blackwell revenue potentially higher, at $5 billion up to $8 billion. The bigger picture is that Blackwell will ramp by an order of magnitude, eventually exceeding Hopper’s revenue. To quantify this, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion in data center revenue since Q1 2023, based on estimates from Trend Force placing Hopper at generating 90% of data center revenue in 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone, based on estimates for up to 60,000 to 70,000 GB200 NVL72 servers priced up to $3 million each. Given the company is lapping tough comparables, the growth rate will slow considerably even if Blackwell does ramp from $6 billion per quarter to $60 billion per quarter by late-2026 (Hopper is in its seventh quarter and Blackwell will be in its seventh quarter by late 2026). This is because excellence begets excellence, and thus, Nvidia is competing with itself with each new generation of GPUs. For example, with Hopper, the company reported peak quarterly growth of 262% and 265% earlier this year, yet is expected to slow to the mid-40% for growth as we close out 2025. Nvidia has multiple levers it can pull and outside forces at play that will help it maintain this 40%+ growth rate. This includes a 1-year product road map, Big Tech’s large appetite for AI spending, and long-term AI GPU market growth from Enterprises and the Consumer, plus a commanding market share position. By coming to market with upgraded, more powerful GPUs on a now-annual cadence, with Blackwell Ultra, Rubin and Rubin Ultra soon to come, Nvidia will continue to be the largest beneficiary of Big Tech’s AI capex to an unprecedented degree as the company continually raises the bar on performance and TCO upgrades with each new generation. Additionally, Nvidia has a software moat with CUDA and the cash to reserve chip capacity in bulk at the fab level to maintain an 80% to 85% share of what executives foresee as a $500 billion AI accelerator market by 2028. I first covered these points in my free newsletter when I published: “Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap by 2030.” Of these points, one of the most visible is that Nvidia continues to pry away tens of billions in cash – and now hundreds of billions —- from the world’s leading tech companies. All roads lead to Nvidia, and it’s no secret that Big Tech and others are competing to purchase Nvidia’s supply constrained GPUs. Our firm began tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for Nvidia demand in 2022, and tracking it on a quarterly basis starting in early 2023 – to help gauge AI demand, I continue to track Big Tech capex quarterly closely for our readers. Our recent checks published in the analysis “AI Spending to Exceed a Quarter Trillion Next Year” reveal that AI spending continues to accelerate, with Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta on track to increase their spend by ~$90 billion YoY in 2024. This does not include xAI, CoreWeave, Oracle and dozens of others who are also spending multiple billions on Nvidia’s GPUs, as well. To better understand the trajectory of AI spending, let’s take a step back to 2023, where the rapid ascent of ChatGPT at the beginning of the year set the stage for AI to step into the spotlight. Big Tech could spend another $70 billion in Q4, based on guidance and comments from executives, who overwhelmingly discussed the need for more AI infrastructure, putting full year capex at ~$240 billion, or nearly 15% higher than the level they were tracking at the start of the year. Big Tech’s Q4 capex could hit $70B, driven by AI infrastructure demand—pushing 2024’s total to ... [+] ~$240B, up 15% from early-year estimates! For 2025, Big Tech has already signaled a willingness to spend substantially more on AI. There is clear ROI for Amazon, Google and Microsoft as they rush to meet the elevated demand that continues to outpace AI capacity in their cloud infrastructures. More broadly, Big Tech and large enterprises are racing to further develop and broaden AI services and models. UBS projects Big Tech will spend ~10% more YoY, placing AI-driven capex at $267 billion; however, if 2024 is any sign, this estimate is too low. This all fits in with longer-term projections from Bank of America that sees a cumulative $700 billion spent on AI through 2026. As we go through a lull between the Hopper generation being in its seventh quarter, and Blackwell not yet shipping in volume, our firm will be buying the dips on Nvidia for many reasons – one of them being it’s the market leader on margins. By having a near monopoly on GPUs, Nvidia has incredibly strong pricing power. The GPUs coming in 2025, called Blackwell, are set to intensify this pricing power with DGX B200 systems reportedly going for up to a 40%+ premium to the previous DGX H100 systems, at $500,000 per server versus the low $300,000s per server, respectively. While GB200 prices are estimated at $60,000 to $70,000 for a single chip, the NVL36 and NVL72 configurations carry much higher price tags and thus, higher average prices per GB200. For example, the NVL36 is expected to cost ~$1.8 million, and for 18 GB200s (36 B200 GPUs), that comes out to $100,000 per GB200 and additional components. For the NVL72, it works out to ~$83,333 per GB200 and additional components. While there were concerns about Nvidia’s margins given that management guided for a sequential contraction in gross margins in Q3, the sheer pricing power of Blackwell will ultimately be a non-issue next year. Nvidia’s operating margin of 62% exceeds second place Microsoft by 17.5 points and third place Meta by 21.9 points; Nvidia is more than double the rest of the Mag 7 including Apple and Alphabet. This is because Hopper’s pricing power versus the Ampere generation: Nvidia’s Compute and Networking operating margin expanded from 28.5% in Q3 FY23 when Hopper reached full production to 71.3% in the most recent quarter even as revenue grew 7x during that seven-quarter period. Nvidia leads the MAG 7 with a 62% operating margin, driven by Hopper’s pricing power—more than ... [+] double Apple, Alphabet, and others in the group! Nvidia is expected to report roughly 50 bps to 100 bps margin contraction this quarter compared to last quarter, and will see roughly 200 bps to 300 bps margin contraction from its peak growth quarters earlier this year. As stated, the pricing power I foresee from Blackwell will keep the margins strong well into 2025, therefore, any concerns over margins this quarter will be a moot point by next year. The strong margins combined with the expected growth in AI accelerators has caused some analysts to increase earnings per share substantially as of late. Bank of America increased its EPS estimates for next calendar year from $3.90 to $4.47 and for calendar year 2026 from $4.72 to $5.67. In February, I wrote an analysis describing how Nvidia’s valuation was “eerily low despite 420% rally since 2023” to help our readers prepare for a higher return in the coming months, which detailed the importance of these revisions. Ultimately, these revisions make the stock cheaper as it leads to more room in the bottom-line valuation. Despite being fairly straight forward, the velocity of the revisions is the single most important point that short sellers and Nvidia critics cannot seem to understand. Of all the quarters since Nvidia’s Hopper release, this is the quarter most likely to be lackluster. This is because the impact of Hopper and the H200s are well-known and the Blackwell generation won’t be shipping in volume until Q1 and ramping further into Q2. I am looking forward to the fiscal year guide in the February call, and am even more excited about the May earnings call when Blackwell’s impact will be better understood. Nvidia is expected to report revenue of $32.9 billion for growth of 81.8% at the midpoint. Analyst expectations are higher than management guidance of $32.5 billion at the midpoint, for growth of 79.4%. This is a deceleration from last quarter’s 122.4% growth, and peak growth of 262% and 265% in the April and January 2024 quarters. As pointed out on EPS, another area where Nvidia is unique is the sheer amount of analyst revisions on the stock. It not only speaks to Nvidia’s dominance in the AI data center to continually surprise the Street, but also to the challenge that analysts face in terms of predicting Nvidia’s persistent revenue surge. For example, this year alone, analysts originally expected Nvidia to report 33.4% revenue growth and this quarter is now expected to be 81.8% growth, for revisions that total 48.4 points in about six months’ time (more than double the original growth expectations). This quarter, there is a wide range of expectations with UBS believing Nvidia will beat by as much as $2 billion, for revenue of $34.5 billion to $35 billion for Q3. Piper Sandler foresees a beat of $1.3 billion for Q3, and a beat of $1.5 billion for Q4. It’s been quite clear for the past two years that analysts do not know how to gauge the growth coming from this company. In 2025, Blackwell is likely to wildly exceed analyst estimates again. This quarter, analysts are expecting EPS of $0.74 compared to EPS of $0.67 last quarter. For nearly two years, the company has beaten EPS estimates by 10% or more, yet in the last quarter, the beat was more muted at 5.7%. On the topic of Nvidia having 2X better margins than most of the Mag 7, here is a glimpse of how Nvidia compares on EPS with a 35%+ growth rate compared to the Mag 7 reporting half this growth rate through 2026: Nvidia: 35.5% 2Y revenue CAGR, 35.1% EPS CAGR Apple: 7.1% revenue CAGR, 14.4% EPS CAGR Microsoft: 14.2% revenue CAGR; 14.9% EPS CAGR Amazon: 10.7% revenue CAGR; 22.3% EPS CAGR Meta: 13.5% revenue CAGR; 12.5% EPS CAGR This quarter, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress, will not offer a full year guide yet have to address the elephant in the room — supply constraints. The fab that makes Nvidia’s chips, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), is working overtime to boost capacity to meet demand. TSMC’s monthly CoWoS capacity was estimated at ~15,000/month at the end of 2023, and was originally expected to triple to ~45,000 to 50,000/month by the end of 2024 in order to meet such high demand from Nvidia, AMD and other advanced node clients. Now, capacity is expected to rise ~300% to 60,000/month. TSMC remains committed to significantly boosting CoWoS capacity over the next few years in order to accommodate these accelerated AI GPU timelines from both Nvidia and AMD, with multiple different product lines expected to come to market over the next couple of years. By year-end 2025, CoWoS capacity is estimated to be 80,000 to 90,000/month, per Morgan Stanley, with Nvidia reportedly already reserving half of this capacity. By the end of 2026, CoWoS capacity is estimated to expand to as much as 140,000 to 150,000/month, representing 10x growth in capacity from the end of 2023. Source: Beth_Kindig xAI Foxconn and Quanta are also both signaling strong demand for Blackwell come 2025. Foxconn has said that they see “crazy” demand for Blackwell servers, and forecast AI servers to make up half of their overall server business in 2025. Foxconn has said that initial shipments are on time for Q4 before ramping much faster in Q1, with Quanta saying the same, that initial shipments are on schedule and will ramp in Q1. Quanta sees triple-digit AI server growth through next year on the back of strong demand, with Deputy Spokesperson Carol Hsu saying that “recent capex guidance from top US hyperscalers also confirmed their aggressive spending on AI in 2025, all from a high base in 2024.” Nvidia is the subject of some of the most severe export restrictions from the US due to its integral role in advancing AI computing. Subsequently, the company’s China exposure is among the lowest in the semiconductor sector, leaving it less exposed should we see heightened geopolitical tensions — especially tariffs. Nvidia’s China revenue was 9.6% in Q1 and 12.2% in Q2, down from the low-20% range in the same quarters in fiscal 2024. For all of FY 2024, Nvidia’s China revenue was 16.9%, down from 21.5% the year prior. Other semi peers are much more heavily exposed to China: Broadcom’s China exposure was 32.2% in FY 2023, Intel’s exposure was above 27%, and Qualcomm and Marvell both had more than 40% of revenue stem from China in FY 2024. Although Nvidia’s fundamentals are a perfect 10, the stock is contending with weak peers, as evidenced by major semiconductor ETFs, SOXX and SMH, not making new highs with the S&P 500. Retail investors often find out the hard way, even the most perfect stock must contend with market forces beyond its control. This is the primary reason Nvidia’s stock may pullback as Nvidia is holding up the semiconductor market, which has grown unusually weak in the past few weeks. SOXX is 20% of its all-time highs and SMH is 14% of its all-time highs despite the S&P 500 making new highs. In a 1-hour webinar for I/O Fund Members last quarter, I discussed why this is an issue for AI investors and what I’d like to see before I resume buying Nvidia. My firm has become well-known for calling Nvidia an AI stock in 2018, and later stating Nvidia would Surpass Apple, and finally that Nvidia will reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030. Yet, perhaps lesser-known is that I nailed the October 2022 bottom by stating Nvidia was Ready to Rumble on H100 GPUs along with a real-time trade alert for $10.80 on October 13th 2022 a mere 25 months ago. Here is what I stated at the exact moment Nvidia’s stock bottomed in October after selling off 60% following the August earnings report: “Today, Nvidia’s AI products serve nearly every enterprise company’s artificial intelligence and machine learning ambitions. The company has an impressive launch schedule starting in October for two flagship products – the RTX 40 Series and the H100 GPU. The timing of these releases is no coincidence as it’s a rapid two months following the crypto/gaming revenue miss. Suffice to say, Nvidia’s management team is prepared to rumble —- putting its very best release in gaming and its most powerful AI chip to-date up against the crypto mining selloff. If history is any indication, the turnaround will only be a matter of time.” The upcoming earnings report has a few similarities to October of 2022, which is that we are toward the end of a product cycle and the CFO cannot offer fiscal year guidance. Despite the H100s ramping and Nvidia having visibility into that ramp, the CFO was tight-lipped two years ago stating: “Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We’ll continue to look at it.” Therefore, I am not expecting much from the CFO on Blackwell in this report, but that lack of detail will be a distant memory this time next year. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The big picture is that Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power. Our firm has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pullback, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from SMH and meaningfully breakout.The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche. Most importantly, the I/O Fund continues to offer buy zones for those who’d like to participate. The I/O Fund first called out Nvidia’s AI opportunity in November 2018 with our first trade alert at $3.15 for returns of 3280%. We also provided 9 buy alerts from 2021 – 2022 to buy NVDA stock below $20. The I/O Fund has been closely analyzing lesser-known stocks in AI plus crypto with real-time trade alerts and webinars.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Chibuike Oguh and Amanda Cooper NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Global shares edged lower on Wednesday as markets weighed tensions between Russia and the West, while bitcoin hit a new record high and the dollar gained after three straight sessions of losses. Shares of Nvidia were down 0.4% in after-market trading after the artificial intelligence powerhouse forecast fourth-quarter revenue that was largely in line with analyst estimates. The stock of the world's most valuable company had closed down 0.8% in regular hours trading on Wednesday. Benchmark S&P 500 finished flat while the Dow gained and the Nasdaq ended lower. Healthcare, energy and materials stocks were the biggest gainers, while consumer discretionary, financials and technology equities were the biggest drag. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32% to 43,408.47, the S&P 500 was flat at 5,917.11 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.11% to 18,966.14. The MSCI All-World index was down 0.16% to 847.84. European shares finished down 0.02%. "Nvidia is obviously a bellwether stock for the market and it seems to be down a little bit after market, but it wasn't a catastrophe by any stretch of the imagination," said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management in Santa Monica, California. "The bar keeps getting raised and raised and raised. But eventually it just becomes really difficult to exceed that bar. And I think that's kind of where we're at with Nvidia." Safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds got a lift on Tuesday after news of Ukraine launching U.S.-made ATACMS missiles into Russia, and with Russia announcing it had lowered the threshold for nuclear action. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, however, later downplayed the nuclear threat, helping to calm markets. Gold prices climbed for a third consecutive session to mark a one-week high. Spot gold rose 0.69% to $2,649.89 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 0.8% higher at $2,651.70. Investors are also watching President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, which may come as soon as Wednesday. Markets were realizing that some of Trump policies, including tariffs and deportations, could be inflationary, said Lukasz Tomicki, founding partner at LRT Capital in Austin, Texas. "There's been this belief that Trump's policies will be inflationary and we've seen the spike in yields since his election," Tomicki said. The dollar index rose 0.54% to 106.68, snapping three consecutive sessions of losses but still below one-year highs. It has gained nearly 3% since the Nov. 5 U.S. general election. The dollar was last up 0.48% against the yen at 155.40. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was up 0.2% at 0.88410. The Chinese yuan weakened against the greenback after the central bank held benchmark lending rates steady, as widely expected. In the offshore market, the yuan was down 0.22% against the dollar at 7.251. Bitcoin, which hit a fresh record high just shy of $95,000, was up 2.53% at $94,579.01. The price has risen by well over 30% since Trump's election, buoyed by expectations that he will create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. The gains in bitcoin have been aided by a Financial Times report that Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social and is majority-owned by Trump, is close to an all-stock acquisition of crypto trading firm Bakkt. Oil prices settled lower after U.S. crude and gasoline stocks rose by more than expected last week. Brent crude futures for January settled 0.68% at $72.81. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for December expired on Wednesday, and settled down 0.75% at $68.87, while the more active WTI contract for January settled down 0.71% at $68.75.

Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Nvidia’s (NVDA) upcoming earnings report has the tech world buzzing. This article dives into the significance of the report, key drivers of Nvidia’s growth, and what investors should watch for. This preview of Nvidia stock earnings explores key aspects investors should consider, from recent financial performance to AI's growing role in driving growth. Nvidia’s earnings report, which is scheduled to be released on November 20, carries immense weight for the company and the tech industry as a whole. The stakes are high for Nvidia stock earnings, as the company leads the AI revolution, making its results a key barometer for the tech industry. As the backbone of AI hardware, Nvidia drives innovation across sectors like data centers, gaming and autonomous vehicles. A strong report not only bolsters investor confidence but also sets a benchmark for competitors like AMD and Intel, influencing the broader market outlook. The AI boom has propelled Nvidia into the spotlight, with its GPUs powering generative AI models like ChatGPT. Analysts view the earnings report as a litmus test for the sustainability of Nvidia’s dominance in this space. With increasing reliance on AI, the report’s outcomes could ripple through related industries, affecting investment trends and corporate strategies. Nvidia’s recent financial results have been a showcase of its dominance in the AI and semiconductor industries. In the previous quarter, the company reported record revenues of $30.04 billion, up 122.4% year over year. The surge was largely driven by AI demand, with data center revenue contributing more than 70% of the total. The recent growth trajectory of NVDA stock earnings demonstrates robust demand across AI and gaming sectors, boosting confidence in its market leadership. Gaming revenue also showed signs of recovery, rebounding 22% year over year, reflecting the easing of macroeconomic pressures. Nvidia’s consistent profitability and strong gross margins—above 70%—further underscore its operational excellence. For more insights on Nvidia's future, explore Nvidia in five years.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. Nvidia’s cutting-edge GPUs remain critical for AI model training and deployment. With companies investing heavily in AI infrastructure, the continued demand for Nvidia’s A100, H100 chips and Blackwell, will likely play a pivotal role in this quarter’s performance. While demand remains robust, any disruption in chip production or supply chain logistics could constrain Nvidia’s ability to meet orders. Recent geopolitical tensions add to these uncertainties. With inflation moderating, consumer spending on gaming hardware is picking up, which could positively influence Nvidia’s gaming division. However, a potential slowdown in enterprise IT spending could temper overall growth. Those impacting export licenses could significantly influence NVDA stock earnings, especially given its reliance on Chinese markets. AI has become the crown jewel of Nvidia’s growth strategy. The company’s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used in everything from chatbots to advanced analytics. Generative AI, in particular, has catapulted demand, with Nvidia benefiting from its early investments in AI-centric architectures. Data centers represent another growth engine. Nvidia’s dominance in this space, with products like the DGX SuperPOD, has solidified its position as the go-to provider for scalable AI infrastructure. Revenue from this segment has consistently surpassed expectations, demonstrating the increasing reliance of enterprises on Nvidia’s technology. AI-driven advancements continue to propel Nvidia stock earnings, as the company solidifies its leadership in GPUs for large-scale computing and AI applications. The gaming sector, once Nvidia’s bread and butter, continues to be a key contributor to its revenue. The company’s RTX 40 series GPUs have been well-received, boosting revenue in recent quarters. Post-pandemic, the gaming industry experienced a slowdown, but recent data suggests a recovery. The resurgence of the gaming market has contributed positively to NVDA stock earnings, with the RTX 40 series outperforming competitor offerings. Nvidia’s efforts to optimize its products for gamers while capitalizing on AI-enhanced gaming experiences have positioned it favorably in this evolving market. In the race for AI dominance, Nvidia has maintained a significant lead over competitors like AMD and Intel. Its proprietary CUDA platform and robust ecosystem give it a clear edge in AI training and inference workloads. While AMD has made strides with its MI300 chips, they have yet to achieve the widespread adoption Nvidia enjoys. Similarly, Intel faces delays in delivering competitive GPU solutions. This disparity reinforces Nvidia’s leadership in both innovation and market share.

Analysts anticipate Nvidia to report earnings of $0.75 per share on revenues of $33.12 billion, marking another record-breaking quarter. Analysts forecast robust figures for Nvidia stock earnings and growth, which reflects surging demand for AI-driven technologies and expanding market penetration. However, the projections come with a caveat: Nvidia’s high valuation means any miss could lead to significant market volatility. As a result, investor expectations are tempered with caution despite the bullish outlook. Historically, NVDA stock earnings drive volatility, as investors anticipate results from Nvidia's high-growth markets like AI and gaming. Nvidia’s stock tends to rally in the weeks leading up to earnings announcements, driven by optimism around its performance. However, the stock also sees heightened volatility, reflecting mixed sentiment among traders and institutional investors. Recent trading sessions suggest a cautious yet positive trend, with Nvidia shares holding steady near all-time highs. Investor sentiment surrounding Nvidia remains overwhelmingly bullish, with analysts largely assigning "Buy" ratings. Consensus price target by analysts for NVDA stock stands at $160.38 currently. Bullish sentiment around NVDA earnings reflects confidence in Nvidia’s AI capabilities and broader growth outlook. Firms like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have reiterated their confidence in Nvidia, citing its leadership in AI and robust revenue growth. However, concerns about valuation and macroeconomic risks have tempered enthusiasm among some investors, who worry about potential downside if growth slows. While AI is a growth driver, Nvidia’s dependence on this single sector makes it vulnerable to any slowdown in AI adoption or spending. As a major chip exporter, Nvidia is exposed to trade restrictions and regulatory challenges, particularly concerning China. Regulatory restrictions on exports to China remain a key factor that could dampen Nvidia stock earnings. Although currently dominant, advances by AMD and Intel could erode Nvidia’s market share if the company fails to maintain its innovation pace. The growing adoption of AI across industries ensures a long runway for Nvidia’s growth. From healthcare to finance, the company’s GPUs are pivotal in enabling AI-driven transformations. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is gaining traction among automakers, offering another lucrative growth avenue. As the metaverse concept evolves, Nvidia’s Omniverse platform positions it to capitalize on this next wave of digital innovation. For a deeper analysis of Nvidia's long-term potential, read Nvidia in 5 years. Nvidia’s earnings report is poised to reflect its dominance in the AI and data center markets. While risks persist, the company’s robust growth trajectory and leadership in innovation make it a stock to watch closely. Investors should prepare for potential volatility as Nvidia navigates its high-stakes earnings season. Nvidia’s earnings reports often lead to significant stock price movements due to its high valuation and investor interest in its growth story. The data center and gaming sectors are Nvidia’s largest revenue drivers, with data centers recently accounting for over 70% of total revenue. Nvidia maintains a strong lead over AMD and Intel in AI and data center markets, thanks to its advanced GPUs and robust ecosystem. With strong demand for AI, data centers, and gaming hardware, Nvidia’s growth trajectory appears sustainable, barring macroeconomic disruptions.

Title: The S&P 500 is about to have a big year, Goldman Sachs says — even without the 'Magnificent 7'

After Morgan Stanley’s (MS-0.05%) bullish outlook, another financial giant has joined the optimistic chorus for the S&P 500 in 2025. What’s more, it expects the growth of the S&P 500 to occur without relying on the outperformance of the Magnificent Seven, marking a notable shift in market dynamics. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs’ (GS+1.12%) chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, released a report projecting an 11% rise in the S&P 500, with the index expected to hit 6,500 by the end of 2025. This aligns closely with Morgan Stanley’s forecast, which set the same target just a day earlier. Goldman’s analysts anticipate that the dominance of the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks — Apple Inc. (AAPL+0.64%), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT+0.41%), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN-0.61%), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL-1.68%) (the parent company of Google), Meta Platforms Inc. (META-0.74%) (formerly Facebook), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA-3.25%) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA+4.14%) — may taper off in 2025. While these companies have driven significant market gains in recent years, analysts suggest that their influence might narrow as broader sectors contribute more evenly to market growth. The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks have significantly outpaced the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 over the past few years. In 2023, these seven companies delivered a remarkable 63 percentage points of outperformance over the rest of the index and have continued their dominance in 2024, outperforming by 22 percentage points year-to-date. However, this gap is expected to narrow in 2025. According to consensus estimates, the outperformance margin is projected to shrink to just seven percentage points. Similarly, the earnings per share (EPS) growth premium enjoyed by the Magnificent Seven is expected to narrow significantly in 2025. In 2024, the seven tech giants outpaced the rest of the S&P 500 by a robust 30 percentage points in EPS growth. However, this advantage is forecasted to shrink dramatically, with the EPS growth premium for the Magnificent Seven expected to compress to just 6 percentage points in 2025. This slowdown signals a broader market transition, with other sectors poised to deliver stronger performance and gradually erode the dominance of these high-flying tech stocks. It suggests a potential diversification of market leadership, as contributions to overall growth become more evenly distributed across a wider range of industries in the coming year.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose nearly 5% on Tuesday, following bullish notes from Wall Street analysts citing strong chip demand ahead of its earnings report set for Wednesday afternoon. In a client note this week, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on Nvidia to $180 from $165, while Truist Securities' William Stein raised his price outlook to $167 from $148. Roy cited "a diverse set of data points," including continued high spending on AI infrastructure by hyperscalers and demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell AI chips. "We believe that NVDA is well positioned in markets that combine to yield an overall TAM [total addressable market, or revenue opportunity] of more than $100 billion exiting 2025 and a longer-term opportunity funnel that could approach $1 trillion,” Roy wrote. Nvidia stock also rose on news that one of its customers, cloud provider Nebius Group (NBIS), is launching its first GPU cluster in the US, which will use up to 35,000 Nvidia chips. A GPU cluster is a network of graphics processing units, or AI chips, with massive compute power used to train and run artificial intelligence software. For reference, Nebius' order of 35,000 Nvidia chips is equivalent to about 4% of the volume of Hopper AI chips Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to have shipped in the October period, Bloomberg consensus data shows. Nvidia declined to comment on the deal. Nvidia stock’s climb comes a day after shares fell on a report by the Information about overheating issues with its Blackwell AI servers. In August, Nvidia was reportedly dealing with design flaws related to the individual Blackwell chips themselves, which prompted the company to push back the chips' production ramp to the January quarter. Nvidia has not confirmed overheating issues with its Blackwell servers, and the company told Yahoo Finance Monday that "the engineering iterations are normal and expected." Truist Securities’ Stein said of the overheating issues reported this week, “Conversations with our industry contacts don't precisely corroborate this latest data point, but they do reflect supply chain challenges around the production ramp.” Despite reported Blackwell issues, Dell Technologies (DELL) said it has already shipped its latest AI hardware product, the PowerEdge system, with Nvidia’s latest GB200 NVL72 systems. “[C]ommentary from NVDA, partners, and our industry contacts feel overwhelmingly positive,” Stein wrote in a note to investors. He pointed to emerging demand for Nvidia chips in the robotics and “traditional” computing sectors as well as that from AI software developers. KeyBanc analysts took a more cautious outlook on Nvidia ahead of earnings, lowering their earnings and revenue outlook for Nvidia for the January quarter, citing a squeeze on demand in China for Nvidia H20 chips. "We believe H20 demand in China is getting pushed out as there is increased pressure among China hyperscalers to use domestic AI solutions," they wrote in a note on Tuesday. They also stated fears that Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips could cannibalize Nvidia's prior-generation Hopper chips. "Regarding H200, we are hearing that some demand is getting pushed out given the availability of Blackwell (B200)." KeyBanc lowered its fiscal fourth quarter sales guidance for Nvidia to $37.7 billion from $40 billion and its earnings outlook to $0.83 per share from its prior guidance of $0.88 per share. Still, KeyBanc maintained its Overweight rating on the stock and its price target of $180. Overall, analysts see Nvidia’s adjusted quarterly earnings rising 85% from the year-ago period to $0.74 per share and revenue rising roughly 84% to $33.2 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. About 90% of Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from steeper losses in late morning trading on Tuesday as fears over a nuclear escalation to the Russia-Ukraine war rattled markets, stealing focus from Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and other corporate results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.5% but off of the lows of the session. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) battled to back to trade just above the flatline after the index fell below its election breakout level earlier in the trading day. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) reversed declines to gain around 0.3% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Investors are assessing news that President Vladimir Putin has signed a revised nuclear doctrine that allows Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons. The changes mean a large-scale aerial attack could prompt a nuclear response, and any attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a nuclear power will be viewed as a joint assault. It comes just days after President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use US long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Ukraine carried out its first such aerial attack in a border region on Tuesday morning. US bond prices climbed alongside gains for gold (GC=F), and other safe-haven assets as the risk-off trade kicked in. Treasury yields — which move inversely to bond prices — fell, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) down 4 basis points to around 4.37%. Gold jumped almost 1% to trade above $2,600 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rose to trade above $92,400 a token. The geopolitical situation blotted out themes such as corporate earnings, President-elect Trump's cabinet picks, the path of interest rates, and Wall Street's view of where stocks are headed. Meanwhile, the countdown is on to Nvidia earnings on Wednesday, seen as a test of the AI trade that has powered gains on Wall Street. The chipmaker's stock edged higher in premarket trading after getting bruised by a report of overheating issues with its flagship new AI product. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy It was a tale of two retailers this morning ... Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Walmart (WMT), the world's biggest retailer, posted fiscal third quarter results that easily beat Wall Street expectations as inflation-weary shoppers continue to search for value. The stock popped over 3%. Sales of $169.59 billion topped analyst estimates for $167.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share eclipsed estimates by 5 cents at $0.58. The company also raised its guidance for fiscal year 2025 for the third time. Read more here. Lowe's (LOW) stock fell nearly 5% shortly after the opening bell as investors honed in on continued negative sales growth, despite results that beat the Street's estimates. The home improvement retailer posted revenue of $20.17 billion, compared to estimates of $19.93 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.89, versus the $2.82 expected. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, less than the 2.7% decline anticipated. The company alluded to ongoing softness in the "DIY bigger-ticker discretionary demand," which was offset by hurricane-related recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton and positive same-store sales in its Pro business and online. Read more here. Housing starts fell in October, pressured by a drop in single-family construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed housing starts dropped 3.1% in October to an annual rate of 1.311 million units. Meanwhile, single-family housing starts slipped 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 970,000 units, unchanged from a year ago. The decline came as mortgage rates have been climbing, with the average 30-year fixed loan hovering around 6.7%. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which have been rising since mid-September partly due to investor anticipation of Trump’s victory and his proposed policies around taxes and tariffs. Higher rates also likely discouraged builders from filing building permits during the month. Contract permits for single family dwellings fell to a pace of 968,000, a 0.5% drop from September’s revised figure of 963,000. "Major storms likely stalled the beginnings of some residential projects, causing a steep decline in construction in the southeast," Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, wrote after the release. "Both housing starts and building permits declined in October as several homebuilders appeared to hold back the start of projects until after the election. However, more recent surveys showed a rebound in homebuilder confidence." US stocks fell at the open on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine, allowing Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons in a possible escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.8%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.5% to fall below its election breakout level, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped around 0.5% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), an AI server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner, soared over 25% premarket Tuesday. The sprint higher came after the company on Monday submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying that it's supplied a compliance plan with the Nasdaq to avoid delisting. Also boosting the stock, Super Micro said it's hired a new auditor, BDO, after its prior accountant, Ernst & Young, resigned in late October. The company was in hot water with the Nasdaq after delaying both its annual and quarterly filings to the SEC following a scathing report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research. The report shed light on potential accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. The company is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice. Even with this week's surge, shares have tumbled roughly 56% over the past three months. After gaining as much as 300% earlier this year, SMCI stock is now down over 20% in 2024. Read the full story here.

Here are the company's e-commerce results by division for the third quarter reported this morning: These results are eye-popping for two reasons: 1) Walmart isn't exactly a startup; 2) the competition online is as fierce as ever.

Hat tip to Goldman Sachs's chief US equity strategist David Kostin for calling out specific stocks in his 2025 outlook piece that just dropped. So often these year-end works of art from investment bank strategists simply serve up S&P 500 (^GSPC) targets, with various underlying scenarios explained. But usually, no stock predictions. Kostin is calling out another year of strong performance for the Mag 7 trade, just not as hot as recent years. Says Kostin: It's a good point by Kostin, and comes in the face of all these Mag 7 stocks trading at rich multiples on hearty outlooks for profit growth. There is only so far you can push a stock price using reasonable future financial assumptions! You can toil around on Mag 7 valuations on Yahoo Finance's new stock comparison tool here. As I noted on Monday in our blog, expectations on Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and outlook are very robust ... to say the very least. If there is one thing that could trip up the bullish trade the morning after earnings, it's Nvidia's guidance. While it will likely be above consensus, it may not be above consensus enough given the dynamics around Blackwell chip demand. Nvidia could opt to go stronger with guidance when it reports three months from now or so. Important point on this from Stifel analyst Ruben Roy this morning in a note: This explosive shift in rates—in the wrong direction—is a harbinger of trouble as it is a crucial long-term driver of stock returns. The Oracle of Omaha has shed more than 615 million shares of Apple over the last year, and recently took a notable stake in one of America's most well-known consumer-facing businesses. Warren Buffett was a net seller of stocks for the eighth consecutive quarter in Q3. Berkshire initiated new positions in only two stocks in the last quarter. Its biggest addition was 1.28 million shares of pizza franchiser Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ). Stanley Druckenmiller wowed investors year after year with his winning streak at the helm of Duquesne Capital Management.

Title: Wall Street is laser-focused on Nvidia's new Blackwell chip as the AI titan heads into 3rd-quarter earnings

Nvidia reported its much-anticipated quarterly earnings on Wednesday as Wall Street watched closely for an update on demand for its latest Blackwell AI chips and spending across the industry. Nvidia delivered another strong quarter, saying "the age of AI is in full steam" as sales of its popular semiconductor chips rose. The company reported third-quarter revenue of $35.08 billion — a 94% year-over-year increase — beating the consensus analyst estimate of $33.25 billion. Wall Street analysts were zeroed in on the company's projections for the current quarter and beyond. Nvidia's guidance gives clues to whether Big Tech companies will continue to shovel massive amounts of cash at it as they train their AI models. Nvidia forecast fourth-quarter sales of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, lining up with estimates of $37.1 billion. While the guidance was largely in line with estimates, it failed to surpass the most sky-high of analyst expectations. The chipmaking giant said production for its Blackwell chip — its follow-up to the wildly popular Hopper chip favored by many Big Tech companies — will continue ramping up into fiscal 2026. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Blackwell demand was strong and "coming from a lot of different places." "Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training, and inference," he said. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that demand for Blackwell "is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026." The company's profit margin, a closely watched metric, is expected to be impacted by Blackwell production in the short-term but Kress said it could return to the mid-70s in the second half of next year. Asked about Trump's tariff plans and any anticipated impact on Nvidia's China business, Huang said the company is taking things "one quarter at a time." "Whatever the new administration decides, we will, of course, support the administration" and "fully" comply with any new regulations, Huang said. Nvidia's stock fell 2% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results and was trading down more than 1% as the analyst call concluded. The stock is up 194% so far in 2024. That's a wrap on the Q&A portion of the call. Huang recaps the "new industrial revolution" the company says is underway amid the AI boom, and talks about Hopper and Blackwell demand. The CEO mentions AI coworkers and the age of robotics as some of the transformations on the horizon. The newest AI applications consume a huge amount of computing, Huang says, and that's good for Nvidia's business. "There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago," Huang says. "The computing scale of pre-training and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI native startups than ever, and the number of successful inference services is rising." Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI, Huang adds. "The age of robotics is coming," Huang says, and the AI age is already upon us. "Thanks for joining us today," the CEO says in closing. "Catch up next time." Asked about Trump's tariff plans and any impact on Nvidia's China business, Huang dodges a bit on talking specifics, saying the company is taking things "one quarter at a time." "Whatever the new administration decides we will of course support the administration," Huang says. Nvidia will comply "fully" with any regulation that comes along with Trump's return to the White House while also continuing to compete in the marketplace, he adds. Kress says the ability to sell Nvidia's networking with many of its systems that the company is doing in its data centers continues to do "quite well." "So this quarter is just a slight dip down, and we're going to be right back up in terms of growing," CFO Kress says. "We're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking, but also the networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems that we are providing them to," she adds. Google's Notebook LM, which started out as an experiment, allows users to drop in links, information, and files. It will generate a podcast hosted by two AI hosts, as well as study guides and briefing docs.Huang says NotebookLM is one of his favorite applications. "I use the living daylights out of it," Huang says, adding that he puts every PDF and archive into it. He says the goal is to train models so that people use it. At the same time, companies are looking to build out their Blackwell systems, the CFO says. It's possible for Hopper to grow from Q3 to Q4, Kress says, but "we'll see." Blackwell will put pressure on profit margins next quarter, but Kress says it may recover as the ramp-up continues next year. "I think it is a reasonable assumption or a goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes." Asked if Nvidia's gross margins could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year, Kress says "Yes." The first shift is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that runs off GPUs. "That fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread," Huang says, adding that "there are no companies" that won't do machine learning. The second shift is that the systems are creating AI, he says. "When we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories," Huang adds. The CEO says he expects the modernization of this new industry to go on for several years. In discussing supply and demand, Huang says the company is at the beginning of a Gen AI revolution and the new generation of foundation models that can reason, such as OpenAI's o1 model. Huang names physical AI as a "really exciting" area. He defined it as AI "that now understands the structure of the physical world." Huang is asked a tough question that references past production challenges for Blackwell and a recent report about heating issue concerns. An analyst asks what he would say to investors who are concerned about Nvidia's ability to execute the roadmap Huang previously presented. In his response, Huang reiterates that Blackwell production is in full steam. Nvidia will deliver more Blackwells this quarter than previously estimated, the CEO says, and demand exceeds supply as expected. Our execution is "going well," he adds. Huang says the engineering required to get each system online in customers' data centers is complicated. "We're very good at it, but still, there's still a lot of a lot of engineering that happens at this point." Huang says Blackwell demand is "coming from a lot of different places." In a question about whether demand for Blackwell is greater since clusters have yet to benefit from it, the CEO said demand is coming from various areas: Pre-training scaling, post-training scaling, and inference time scaling. Huang says Nvidia is especially seeing "inference demand go up" CEO Jensen Huang fields the first question. Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to decline sequentially. The CFO says the decline is due to supply constraints. She adds that Nvidia is currently focusing on on "ramping to strong demand." As Blackwell ramps up, Kress says margins are expected to be in the low 70's, and "when fully ramped," she expects margins in the mid-70's. Accenture has trained 30,000 consultants on Nvidia's product stack. Kress highlighted one case in which the steps required for a marketing campaign decreased 35% with AI. The CFO mentions Deloitte as well. Combined the two have more than 1 million employees. Kress says Nvidia data center revenue in China "grew significantly due to shipments of export-compliant Hopper products." As Kress continues with her prepared remarks, Nvidia stock was trading down around half a percent in after-hours trading. Nvidia had some early production issues that it had to work through. Nvidia's CFO says Blackwell is in "full production" after making changes. Nvidia shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including one of the first engineering samples. She says demand for the chip "is staggering," and the company is "racing to scale supply" to meet the demand. Kress also mentions data center revenue hitting a new quarterly record of $30.8 billion. CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which opens with some prepared remarks about the company's performance over the third quarter. The execs will then field questions from Wall Street analysts. Emarketer technology analyst Jacob Bourne tells BI that Nvidia continues to show its dominance in AI chip demand, but "critical questions" remain around Blackwell's production and customer concentration. Bourne says Nvidia's expansion into areas including digital twins and autonomous vehicles "shows promising diversification" but also strong dependance on certain customers. "Despite Nvidia's technological leadership through CUDA and its first-mover advantage in AI infrastructure, there's little room for execution missteps in 2025," Bourne says. "Particularly given uncertainties around Blackwell's rollout and increasing competition from both AMD and key customers' in-house chip development efforts." 3rd quarter Revenue: $35.08 billion, +94% y/y, estimate $33.25 billion 4th quarter guidance Revenue: $37.5 billion, plus/minus 2%, estimate $37.1B Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock was down 2% heading into its third-quarter earnings report. The intra-day decline was more than triple the Nasdaq's 0.6% decline, and far outpaced the S&P 500's 0.4% dip. The options market implies an 8% swing in Nvidia stock in either direction after it reports its earnings results later today. If realized, the swing would imply a $300 billion gain or loss in market value for the AI giant. Nvidia has a market valuation of about $3.53 trillion as of Wednesday afternoon. Long-time Nvidia bull Dan Ives of Wedbush expects Nvidia to deliver the goods when it reports earnings on Wednesday. "We expect another drop the mic performance from Nvidia tomorrow after the bell as right now Jensen & Co. are the only game in town with $1 trillion+ of AI Cap-Ex on the way for the next few years with Nvidia's GPUs the new oil and gold in this world," Ives said in a Tuesday note. Ives said he expects Nvidia to beat both revenue and guidance estimates by $2 billion. "Blackwell production and demand appear robust and we expect very bullish commentary from Jensen on the conference call which will be a focus of the Street that sends the bears back into their caves and hibernation mode," Ives said. Ives added that he is encouraged by the "cloud numbers and AI data points" offered by cloud hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet during their recent earnings calls. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kunjan Sobhani said in a recent note that he expects Nvidia's profit margins to remain well above the 70% level, which is high for a hardware manufacturer. "Gross margin is likely to decline as much as expected in 4Q yet remain comfortably above 73%," Sobhani said. "Nvidia is likely to solidly exceed 3Q revenue consensus more than it did in the past two quarters and the company will likely raise 4Q guidance, driven by greater adoption of its Hopper family, even as hyperscaler customers await the Blackwell ramp-up in 2025," Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kunjan Sobhani said in a recent note. Sobhani highlighted that Blackwell delay concerns were likely solved in the third-quarter, setting up the expectation that shipments "to key customers" will begin in the fourth-quarter. "Increased capex guidance from hyperscalers has further boosted confidence in near-term sales. We expect small volume shipments of Blackwell in fiscal 4Q, reaching full speed in 1Q26, though supply remains constrained," Sobhani said. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they're hyper-focused on Nvidia's guidance for the fourth quarter, which they expect should confirm their bullish thesis on the stock. They added that they expect the company's "break out" quarter to be the first quarter of 2025 as the Blackwell product launch ramps up. Goldman Sachs expects Nvidia to deliver $34.3 billion in revenue for the third quarter, with adjusted earnings per share at $0.79, which is above consensus estimates. "We expect strong demand for Nvidia's Hopper-based GPUs (i.e. H100 and particularly the H200) and Spectrum-X (i.e. Ethernet-based Networking product) to drive strong double-digit (%) Data Center revenue growth," Goldman Sachs said. The strong expected earnings results, combined with Nvidia's current valuation, suggest to Goldman that the stock should perform well going forward. Goldman Sachs rates Nvidia at "Buy" with a $150 price target. According to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, investors should manage expectations around guidance for Nvidia's highly anticipated Blackwell launch. "We caution investors to temper expectations for Blackwell inclusion for the Jan-Q outlook (we conservatively look for $3B-$5B in sales), limiting upside to consensus views in the near term as NVDA likely takes a somewhat conservative stance to provide itself with a buffer," Zino said in a recent note. Still, Zino expects Blackwell chips will be sold out for much of 2025. "We expect Blackwell to be supply constrained through CY 25, given heightened demand from hyperscalers to support next-generation data centers. In addition to Blackwell expectations/performance concerns that will likely dominate NVDA's Q&A session on the call, we expect investors to dissect any comments on tariffs/Sovereign AI after Trump's victory," Zino said. CFRA Research rates Nvidia at "Buy" with a $160 price target. 3rd quarter Revenue estimate: $33.25 billion 4th quarter Source: Bloomberg Jump to
