ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump’s much larger than expected “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, ... More April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. Many economists forecast the high probability of a US and global recession if these tariffs are maintained. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. The announced tariffs were significantly more sizable than anticipated. While the possible benefits from trading on fairer terms, reducing the U.S. trade deficit, and bringing more production back home are attractive, it remains unclear if tariffs will accomplish that goal, and there are short-term economic headwinds from the strategy. The easiest way to think about Trump’s tariff regime is in five parts: reciprocal, USMCA, China, sectoral, and commodities. The reciprocal portion comprises a 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S., and about 60 countries are subject to tariffs above 10%. For example, Vietnam was hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff rate. The universal 10% tariff rate became effective on Saturday, but the higher rate for those specific countries will be implemented on April 9. Canada and Mexico, who are part of the USMCA trading pact, were subjected to no further tariffs beyond the previously announced 25% tariff on all non-USMCA-compliant products. As expected, China was treated as a special case. Tariffs on Chinese goods will be at least 79% and could reach over 100% if the U.S. enforces the announced additional tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Lastly, specific commodities and economic sectors will be subject to a specified tariff rate rather than a country-specific levy. The commodities and sectors include steel, aluminum, lumber, copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos. For example, pharmaceuticals are currently exempt from any tariffs, which helps Ireland as a large exporter in that sector. Tariffs are paid on goods flowing into the country; some portion of that cost is almost certain to be passed along to the end consumer. Most expect companies to absorb some of the additional cost, but the split between the two groups is unclear. Since tariffs add to the costs, they can be considered a tax increase for economic purposes. Strategas Research Partners states these tariffs will be the most significant single tax increase as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1968. This tax increase is almost sure to reduce consumer spending and thus negatively impact U.S. economic growth. Furthermore, corporate earnings could be reduced if companies are unable or unwilling to pass along the full price increase. Largest US Tax Increases Since 1968 To put it into context, Strategas estimates that the revenue generated from the tariffs will be larger than all the tax revenue paid by companies. U.S. Estimated Tax Revenues These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty since the duration or further changes to tariff rates are impossible to estimate. Furthermore, possible retaliation or other second-order effects add to the difficulty in forecasting the likely impact with precision. The vast scale of the tariffs caused the JPMorgan economic team to raise the risk of recession this year to 60%, and it was stated that “these policies, if sustained, would likely push the U.S. and global economy into recession this year.” The increased risk of recession and lower earnings sent stocks 9.1% lower last week. The S&P 500 sits 17.4% below its mid-February high, close to the 20% decline from the peak that defines a bear market. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse and is deep into a bear market at 28.5% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry about more bond defaults, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. The spreads on Baa corporate debt increased last week reflecting the increasing fear of an impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads U.S. Treasury yields moved lower last week despite concerns that increased tariffs could cause a spike in inflation. The lower yields were caused by the combination of a flight to safety, reduced economic growth forecasts, and increased expectations for Federal Reserve short-term interest rate cuts. US Treasury Yields The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks underperformed the less economically sensitive defensive stocks by a wide margin last week. This suggests that economic fears are a primary cause of the stock plunge. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Looking at stock declines around recessions, the average decline in the S&P 500 is almost 30%. The average is dragged lower by the three most recent economic contractions, which were all atypical. Since stocks are already 17.4% below their peak, assuming we enter a recession, the decline would already be worse than three out of the last 12 recessions. S&P 500 Returns Around Recessions The analysis was widened to all the bear market-like stock declines, defined as a greater than 19% fall in prices, and since 1946, half of those plunges were associated with a recession. Not surprisingly, the declines related to recession tended to be more severe, including the deepest stock plunge during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Large Stock Declines Since 1946 As sure as the sun always rises, stocks eventually reward the optimist. Unfortunately, timing the rebound is impossible since waiting for good news rarely works. Stocks typically rebound sharply before the data or headlines begin to improve. On average, stocks bottom five months before the end of a recession and have generally risen by over 27% from the bottom before the recession even ends. Just as stocks tend to fall more sharply around recessionary periods, the rebound is typically more robust. S&P 500 Returns Following Large Decline Lows So far, the focus has been on the downside risk. With markets quickly pricing in a poor outcome and coming closer to assuming a recession, it is worth considering how things could turn around. There is always the possibility that Trump’s gambit succeeds in gathering quick concessions from other countries. Since the U.S. is a massive consumer market, one should not underestimate the economic pressure these tariffs will put on different countries. He could also decide that the economic pain was too great and reduce the tariffs unilaterally. The U.S. courts could also strike down the tariffs. While the tariffs seem sure to depress the economy indefinitely, economic activity could see a soft patch rather than a significant contraction aided by quick Federal Reserve rate cuts. As noted previously, the tariffs, if retained, are likely to produce significant tax revenue. This revenue should help the U.S. budget deficit. Furthermore, it opens the door to maintaining and lowering the current tax rates to offset this massive tax increase. The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Thursday’s consumer inflation (CPI) will be notable, though it will not reflect the impact of last week’s tariff announcements. Still, the underlying pace of inflation will be noteworthy for Federal Reserve policy decisions, and some of the earlier tariffs were in place, so clues as to the passthrough could be gleaned. Though last Friday’s March jobs release was better than expected, with an increase in 228,000 jobs according to the nonfarm payroll report, it was widely ignored as old news due to the tariff implementation. Markets moved quickly in reaction to the likely economic drag from the tariffs, with four expected rate cuts for 2025 and an over 100% probability of a rate cut on or before the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected First quarter earnings season begins this week, with some large banks reporting on Friday. While current earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. Good companies typically have better pricing power and operational excellence, so they should be able to pass along or mitigate the increased costs compared to weaker businesses. While the data does not yet indicate a high likelihood of recession, the massive scale of effectively a tax increase from the expanded tariffs raises the risk. Notably, economic activity may see a brief improvement as companies and consumers move in advance of the tariffs. Still, that pull-forward of activity and the tariff-impacted higher prices for goods will weigh on future growth. The market is getting all vegetables from the tariffs, which have driven stock prices near bear market territory. Stocks have probably not fully priced in a recession, but quite a bit of bad news is priced into the outlook. There is room for optimism that investors could eventually get some dessert by way of tax cuts and deregulation, offsetting the drag from tariffs. History tells us that stocks almost always move higher before the headlines improve, so timing the rebound is nearly impossible. The short-term movements of stocks and the ultimate impact of the tariffs are impossible to predict, so investors should keep enough high-quality bonds and cash to cover upcoming expenses or liabilities. As a positive, bonds have returned to their status of providing a hedge to stocks during this downturn. While predicting the short-term price action of stocks is a fool’s errand, last Friday’s indiscriminate and panic selling does provide some optimism that stocks could find some footing this week. The real opportunity in any challenging period is in finding good companies where the stock market has allowed short-term hurdles or forced selling to send the valuation and expectations low enough to provide attractive long-term expected returns.

Title: What To Expect in the Markets This Week

March inflation data and Big Bank earnings are among the major items on this week’s economic calendar as investors look for signals about what's next for markets following a chaotic end to last week. Friday ended a two-day run that will end up in the history books, the major US indexes logging their biggest weekly declines since the start of the Covid pandemic. Investors are now seeking clues for what might be next on prices and economic health following President Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which is expected to take effect Wednesday. China announced 34% retaliatory tariffs that are scheduled to begin on Thursday. Investopedia's live coverage of Monday's trading can be read here. What else is on tap? Friday earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and BlackRock (BLK) are among the financial institutions on the calendar. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and CarMax (KMX) also are scheduled to deliver earnings earlier in the week. Federal Reserve meeting minutes are expected to provide insight into economic conditions and the path of interest rates. Data on consumer sentiment and credit levels will be closely watched amid uncertainty over inflation and tariffs. Monday, April 7 Tuesday, April 8 Wednesday, April 9 Thursday, April 10 Friday, April 11 March inflation data will be in the spotlight as market participants keep an eye on prices in the wake of President Trump’s sprawling tariffs, which are expected to take effect on Wednesday, reigniting recession fears. Economists at Wells Fargo expected the Consumer Price Index to remain unchanged in March, with that data’s scheduled release for Thursday. The sideways movement comes as inflation has edged lower recently, including a steeper-than-expected decrease in February’s CPI reading. Inflation has been a key reason cited by Federal Reserve officials for keeping interest rates at their current levels. Wednesday’s scheduled release of the minutes from the Fed’s most recent March meeting will provide more insight into how current economic conditions are affecting the way that central bankers view interest rate levels. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and New York Fed President John Williams are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for March will give investors more information about prices at the wholesale level, potentially feeding into consumer prices down the line. Investors are also expecting data on wholesale inventory levels on Wednesday. Another key inflation measurement will come in Friday’s scheduled release of consumer sentiment data, which will include consumer price expectations that can have an influence on the direction of inflation. Consumer and business sentiment has also been closely watched after Trump’s tariffs policy has raised worries over price increases and worsening economic conditions. Small business sentiment is expected to come on Tuesday as recent surveys have shown that business owners are also starting to sour on the economy. Big Banks will lead off the latest earnings season with a slew of scheduled reports later this week, giving investors their first look at first-quarter earnings. Analysts will be watching to see if banks can continue to drive growth in areas like investment banking and net interest income. JPMorgan Chase is expected to kick off a string of reports from financial firms with its earnings report Friday, coming after the world’s largest bank by market capitalization delivered a surprising jump in profits last quarter. JPMorgan grew its investment banking revenue while its net interest income also increased. BlackRock’s announcement scheduled the same day comes after the firm posted a record quarter for assets under management. Investors likely will be listening for updates on Blackrock’s $30 billion AI infrastructure funding project with Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Elon Musk’s xAI and other firms. Wells Fargo’s scheduled Friday report comes as its net income topped analyst estimates but the bank just missed its revenue target last quarter. Before Friday’s financial services reports, Delta Air Lines’ scheduled report on Wednesday comes as the carrier has lowered its projections for the quarter on weakening travel demand amid economic uncertainty. The lowered outlook came after Delta reported a profitable prior quarter on stronger sales of premium offerings. Levi Strauss has also warned that macroeconomic conditions could hurt its 2025 sales, with the jeans makers’ quarterly report scheduled for Monday. Egg seller Cal-Maine’s scheduled report on Tuesday comes amid interest in prices for that food stock, becoming a symbol in the battle against inflation and a political talking point. But Cal-Maine has benefited from increased demand for eggs amid a bird flu outbreak, posting better-than-expected results in the previous quarter due in part to higher egg prices. Other noteworthy reports this week include Rust-Oleum maker RPM International on Tuesday, Corona beer brewer Constellation Brands on Wednesday, and online car seller CarMax on Thursday.

Retail investors are trying to time the market and take advantage of the multi trillion-dollar market meltdown triggered by Trump’s new tariffs. A new note to clients from JPMorgan Chase says mainstreet investors poured $4.7 billion into stocks on Thursday, representing the largest collective allocation in 10 years, reports Reuters. Retail is primarily buying small-cap technology stocks in its attempt to buy the dip – a sector that institutional investors have increasingly bet against. Retail investors are also focusing on Mag 7 stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN), although they are net sellers of Tesla (TSLA). More than $5 trillion has been wiped out of US markets in the past two days amid President Trump’s massive tariff hikes, which have sparked fears of a global trade war and an impending economic downturn. Today at time of publishing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1,602 points, representing a 3.9% drop, with the S&P 500 down 244 points for a 4.5% decline.

Title: Chips mostly dodged Trump's tariffs, but that could soon change

When President Donald Trump announced his reciprocal tariffs this week that sent global markets into a panic, a few exemptions were made, including for semiconductors. In addition to the country-by-country reciprocal tariffs, including 34% for China and 32% for Taiwan, Trump introduced a minimum baseline tariff of 10% on imports from all other countries. However, the White House said some goods, such as steel and auto parts already subject to tariffs, and energy and minerals not available in the U.S., are not subject to the reciprocal tariffs. While semiconductors are also on this list, Jefferies (JEF-3.30%) analysts said in a note on Friday that “this is because President Trump is considering additional sector-specific tariffs on those items.” And although it’s not a direct impact yet, the tariffs will still “have significant ramifications on end demand for” the electronics and devices that semiconductors are inside of, the analysts said, because the prices for those items will climb. Jefferies expects the tariffs to continue pressuring chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-2.99%), Broadcom (AVGO+4.16%), and Marvell (MRVL+2.18%), “which all purchase the majority of their chips from TSMC (TSM-1.92%)” in Taiwan. The analysts also expect stock pressure for companies that have end markets that rely on the Chinese supply chain, namely Apple (AAPL-4.47%). “[W]e expect there to be more Semis restrictions/tariffs coming up given concerns over national security which are elevated for this administration,” Jefferies analysts said, adding that they “see potential for further export restrictions” in addition to chip-specific tariffs. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported last week that foreign government officials and tech company leaders are asking the Trump administration to relax some rules under the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, which aims to control which countries, including U.S. allies, can import advanced semiconductors needed for AI development. Known as the AI diffusion rule, the framework puts countries into three different tiers, and outlines how many chips countries can import, where the chips can be deployed, and how nations can work together on AI. The rules came out at the tail end of the Biden administration. With the May 15 deadline to be in compliance looming, foreign governments and tech companies reportedly want the Trump administration to rethink some restrictions out of worries that the rules could hamper AI development and investment.

Title: Nvidia and Other Chip Stocks Fall as Tariff-Fueled Rout Continues

The chips are down. Chip stocks fell Friday, losing ground on the second trading day after President Donald Trump unveiled a set of global tariffs that sent stock markets dramatically lower—and the first since China announced its own retaliatory measures. The latest news offered investors yet another indication that trade war is here to stay, at least for now. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX), which tracks chip shares, was recently down about 7%. Four of its components, namely Marvell Technology (MRVL), Coherent (COHR), Entegris (ENTG) and Micron Technology (MU), were recently off more than 7% apiece. “Because many finished electronics goods and IT infrastructure goods are ultimately imported from many of [the countries affected by the new tariffs],” UBS analysts wrote Thursday, “this could have a profound negative impact on electronics demand.” Nvidia (NVDA), one of last year’s stock-market darlings, was off more than 7% in recent trading. Citi analysts yesterday suggested that analog chipmakers like Analog Devices (ADI) could outperform the broader sector in a downturn; its shares were off some 6% in recent trading. This week’s tariff announcements have hit stocks broadly. Today, all three major indexes were recently down roughly 4%, with the blue-chip Dow faring only a bit better. All 11 of the S&P 500’s sectors were recently in decline; its semiconductor and equipment subindex was down about 7%. China’s new tariffs on US imports are set to take effect Thursday, according to that country’s finance ministry.

The Nasdaq Composite was on track to fall into a bear market on Friday as the tariff-induced global stock sell-off deepened. The Nasdaq was recently down nearly 4% Friday morning, putting the index more than 20% off its December all-time high. The tech-heavy index was sliding alongside the other major large-cap indexes, with the S&P 500 off about 4% and the Dow down about 3.5%. The Nasdaq will have to close below 16,139.11 for a bear market to be confirmed. The index was recently trading at 15876 after rebounding from its session low below of 15600. The Nasdaq on Thursday had its worst day since March 2020 after President Donald Trump outlined a raft of steep tariffs that economists warn risk pushing the U.S. economy into a recession while stoking inflation. The sell-off continued Friday after China hit back with its own tariff on all US goods, matching the rate on Chinese goods announced by Trump. The move raised concerns that Trump’s reciprocal tariffs could be the beginning of a global trade war that results in even higher tariffs than those already announced. The majority of the more than 3,000 stocks in the Nasdaq were trading in the red on Friday, but mega-cap tech stocks were weighing most heavily on the index. Shares of Apple (AAPL) were down more than 4% after tumbling nearly 10% yesterday, their worst day since March 2020. AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) were both down more than 7%, while EV maker Tesla (TSLA) tumbled nearly 10%,

Title: The Magnificent 7 stocks slide again and the Dow drops 1,100 points as China retaliates in trade war

The Magnificent 7 tech stocks plunged, leading the overall market lower for a second day, after Jerome Powell warned about the effect of President Donald Trump’s new tariffs, but said the Federal Reserve won’t race to cut interest rates. “It’s now becoming clear tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,” the Fed chair said at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing conference. Stocks extended their declines after Powell spoke on Friday. The S&P 500 index ended the day down almost 6%, with the Nasdaq Composite dropping 5.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding 2,231 points, or 5.5%. Stocks had their worst day in five years on Thursday, and then did so again on Friday. Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%) and Apple (AAPL-4.47%) each dropped about 7.3%. Declines in the other Mag 7 stocks were 5% for Meta (META+2.36%), 4.1% for Amazon (AMZN+2.38%), 10.4% for Tesla (TSLA-3.42%), 3.5% for Microsoft (MSFT-0.62%), and 3.2% for Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+0.91%). Energy companies, including Exxon Mobil (XOM-1.79%), Chevron (CVX-2.40%), and ConocoPhillips (COP-1.58%), plunged on recession fears. Powell said the size and duration of the tariff effects are uncertain and that policymakers “don’t need to be in a hurry” to make decisions on monetary policy, he added. “We’re going to need to wait and see how this plays out.” Trump, via Truth Social, again called on Powell to cut rates and accused the studiously neutral Fed chair of playing politics. He’d earlier said via social media that his “POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE” after insisting on Thursday that “it’s going very well” and that “the markets are going to boom.” Nonetheless, Nike led a rebound in some shoe and garment makers’ shares, gaining 4.3% midday, after Trump said that he’d held a “very productive call” with Vietnam’s leader and that trade talks were possible. The shoemaker, which sources about half its production in the Southeast Asian country, was up 3% at market close. Earlier on Friday, Beijing imposed imposed 34% tariffs on all American goods, matching Trump’s duties, and took other measures, including restricting exports of some rare earth materials and barring some U.S. companies from doing business in China. The EU has yet to announce any retaliation. Additionally, employers added 228,000 jobs in March on a seasonally adjusted basis, rising from a downwardly revised 117,000 in February and beating the average estimate of 130,000. The jobless rate nonetheless increased to 4.2% from 4.1%, and hourly wages increased 0.30%, both matching projections. The better-than-expected jobs numbers for March are relics of a bygone era in the U.S. economy and won’t stand in the way of the Fed cutting interest rates later this year, economists said. “Mounting uncertainty and consequential investment paralysis will likely lead them to an easing bias in the second half of 2025,” Jefferies (JEF-3.30%)’ chief U.S. economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients. The Fed’s policy in this cycle has been reactive, however, so it’s likely to stay on hold for now, he added. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Stocks may extend their post-tariff sell-off Friday after China retaliated with its own 34% duties on all U.S. goods, restrictions on rare earth exports, and other measures. Futures linked to the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are all pointing to a lower open. The Magnificent 7 stocks extend their slide on Friday, with Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%) plunging 3.6% and Apple (AAPL-4.47%) dropping 4.8% in premarket trading as of 8:50 a.m. EDT. Declines were 5.4% for Meta (META+2.36%), 6.2% for Amazon (AMZN+2.38%), 5.1% for Tesla (TSLA-3.42%), 1.6% for Microsoft (MSFT-0.62%), and 2.7% for Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL+0.91%). Shoe and garment makers extended their sell-off as they face tariffs on their Asian-made products. Nike (NKE-4.04%) fell 5% before the bell, Lululemon (LULU+0.28%) slid 5%, and Uggs-maker Deckers (DECK-1.04%) declined 4.4%. Energy companies, including Exxon Mobil (XOM-1.79%), Chevron (CVX-2.40%), and ConocoPhillips (COP-1.58%) declined on recession fears. Equities markets had their worst day in five years Thursday as the S&P 500 plunged 4.8%, the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,679.39 points, or 4%. Thursday afternoon, President Donald Trump showed no signs of backing down on his plans to impose tariffs that are more severe than expected.“It’s going very well,” he said, comparing the imposition of tariffs with surgery and claiming “the markets are going to boom” along with the country. Friday, a government report showed that the U.S. labor market held up better than expected in March despite the federal government’s layoffs, the crackdown on immigrants, and surveys showing that consumers and businesses are increasingly anxious about the economy. Employers added 228,000 jobs in March on a seasonally adjusted basis, rising from a downwardly revised 117,000 in February and beating the average estimate of 130,00. The jobless rate nonetheless increased to 4.2% from 4.1%, and hourly wages increased 0.30%, both matching projections. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook at 11:25 a.m. EDT. Other central bank speakers include Michael Barr — who will talk about AI and banking — and Christopher Waller. Some stocks to watch today: Blackstone’s (BX-1.28%) stocks slid 4.4% in premarket trading. The investment company is considering selling two AirTrunk data centers in Australia for about A$2 billion ($1.3 billion) each to fund the Australian unit’s growth, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar. Constellation Brands (STZ-0.57%), which makes, imports, and distributes alcoholic beverages, reported sales and per-share profit that were slightly higher than the average analyst estimates on FactSet. The stock fell 2.1% in premarket trading. Exxon stock fell 2.6% before the open. The energy giant may report a $2.7 billion gain in profit in the first quarter from the prior three months, with fuel manufacturing the largest contributing factor, Bloomberg reported, citing a company filing. Guess (GES-11.52%) stock dropped 5.6% in premarket trading after plunging 11.8% on Thursday. The garment maker reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales and per-share profit that exceeded analyst expectations. The company’s guidance for fiscal first-quarter revenue also topped consensus.

Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%) fell with other Magnificent 7 stocks on Thursday as the market reacted to new tariffs — but the company also may’ve slipped because a major bank downgraded it for unrelated reasons. The chipmaker’s shares were down 6.6% during pre-market trading on Thursday morning, less than a day after President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs against U.S. trade partners. At the market open Thursday, Nvidia’s shares were down 4.9% — and then fell an additional 1.3% during mid-day trading. The company ended the day down 7.8% at the market close. However, Altimeter Capital chief executive Brad Gerstner told CNBC that he expects Nvidia to fair well amid the Trump administration’s new tariffs. “The growth and the demand for GPUs is off the charts,” Gerstner said during an appearance on “Fast Money Halftime Report.” He added that semiconductors are exempted from the tariffs — a “wise exception” — because of the global AI race. Meanwhile, HSBC (HSBC-3.19%) analyst Frank Lee downgraded his rating for the company’s stock from “buy” to “hold” on Thursday, citing concerns over Nvidia’s ability to continue its strong growth. Lee said Nvidia had previously had strong pricing power due to its dominance of the market for graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are essential to powering generative artificial intelligence models, according to MarketWatch (NWSA-2.01%). However, that pricing power could have less of an impact in the future, as the company hasn’t raised average selling prices. It “is likely to cap earnings upside momentum,” Lee reportedly said in the note. He also noted that Nvidia’s earnings and guidance beats in the last three quarters have been shrinking, due to “increasing market focus on Nvidia’s earnings as well ongoing uncertainty over its Blackwell supply chain ramp-up.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Apple (AAPL-4.47%) shares were down by 8.3% during afternoon trading on Thursday, leading the decline of Magnificent 7 stocks after President Donald Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” following the market close on Wednesday. At mid-day on Thursday, Amazon was down by 7.2%, Nvidia was down by 6.2%, Meta was down by 5.8%, Tesla was down by 4.3%, Alphabet was down by 3.1%, and Microsoft was down by 1.4%. During pre-market trading, Apple had been down by 8.2%, while Amazon (AMZN+2.38%) was down by 6.7%, Meta (META+2.36%) was down by 6.6%, Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%) was down by 6.2%, Tesla (TSLA-3.42%) was down by 6.2%, Alphabet (GOOGL+0.91%) was down by 3.8%, and Microsoft (MSFT-0.62%) was down by 1.9%. Meanwhile, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all pointed to a lower opening on Thursday morning. The Trump administration’s tariffs are being applied on a country-by-country basis, and are calculated by combining the rate of tariffs, non-monetary barriers, “and other forms of cheating.” Trump said the U.S. will charge other countries “approximately half” of their charges. “April, 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” Trump said on Wednesday, adding that his tariffs are the “declaration of economic independence.” Baseline 10% tariffs are expected to go into effect on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET, while reciprocal levies are set to be effective on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. Jefferies (JEF-3.30%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that the Trump administration’s 54% tariffs on China and 26% tariffs on India “caused a selloff on the Apple supply chain.” The analysts said it is currently unclear if Apple will be exempted from the tariffs as it was during Trump’s first administration in 2018, and that the company’s plan to invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years could “help it get exemption.” “The simple thought is likely that Apple’s products will be subject to this tariff, and thus demand will get hit and thus the supply chain will suffer,” Jefferies analysts said. “[I]n the worst case,” the analysts estimated that if Apple’s iPhone imports are subject to the 54% tariff on China and the company absorbs the cost to avoid a negative impact on sales volume, its full year net profit could be reduced by 14%. “It is possible for AAPL to raise price and pass on some tariff burden to high-end consumers without affecting volume too much (upside to our forecast), but that may be offset by the fact that some non-iPhone products would also create additional [negative] impact on AAPL’s earnings,” Jefferies analysts said. However, the analysts said that even if Apple is exempted from the reciprocal tariffs, “it will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better and give more share to those who could help AAPL achieve this objective.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Markets plummeted Thursday in the wake of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,679.39 points, or 4%, with the damage extending to most industries on the prospects of stagflation — that is, slower economic growth accompanied by faster inflation. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8% and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 6%, making Thursday the market’s worst day for stocks in five years. Airlines, retailers and big banks took big hits, with some healthcare companies among the few gainers. For the Magnificent 7, declines were 9.3% for Apple (AAPL-4.47%), 9% for Amazon (AMZN+2.38%), 9% for Meta (META+2.36%), 5.5% for Tesla (TSLA-3.42%), 7.8% for Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%), 2.4% for Microsoft (MSFT-0.62%), and 3.9% for Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL+0.91%). Big Tech will be vulnerable to retaliation by the European Union. “Trump’s tariff plan probably represents a shift for markets to quickly move from max uncertainty to max pessimism, although if countries retaliate — and Europe and China are talking like they will — rates could go up even further and drive another leg down for markets,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial (LPLA+1.09%). Buchbinder expects stocks to stabilize provided negotiations bear fruit and take tariff rates down, assuming markets are assured that no meaningful tariff rates will be increased because of retaliation, he wrote in an email distributed to the media. Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM-0.15%), isn’t so sanguine as she expects the levies to actually go into effect as announced. “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk,” she told Quartz on Wednesday after the news. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” Trump showed no signs of backing down on Thursday, saying, “It’s going very well,” comparing the imposition of tariffs to surgery, and claiming “the markets are going to boom” along with the country. The president’s early claims that the import taxes will bring back jobs is debatable, and duties have a poor historical track record of boosting manufacturing employment. The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the EU will be slapped with 20%. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%, respectively. The large tariffs on Asian countries will weigh heavily on shoe and apparel makers, which do much of their manufacturing in the region. Shares of Nike (NKE-4.04%) plunged 14%, while those of Lululemon (LULU+0.28%) plummeted 9.6%, and those of Uggs- and Hoka-maker Deckers (DECK-1.04%) tumbled 14%. Restoration Hardware’s parent RH (RH+13.17%) tumbled 40% on Thursday on a double whammy of earnings and tariffs. Williams-Sonoma (WSM+2.09%) plunged 16%, and at the other end of the retail spectrum Dollar Tree (DLTR+7.93%) fell 13%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. General Motors (GM-2.47%), Ford (F-3.97%) and Stellantis (STLA-5.81%) nonetheless extended their declines — by 4.3%, 5.9% and 9.4%, respectively — as Canada retaliated in kind for Trump’s new 25% tariffs on cars and trucks. “The tariff announcement was intended to give clarity on tariff policy,” Art Wheaton, an auto industry expert at Cornell University, said via an email sent to the media. “Unfortunately, it has created more questions and confusion.” Stellantis has already suspended plants in Canada and Mexico, he added. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free from China. The shares of PDD (PDD-5.11%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.5%. The the stock market — and the economy — isn’t certain to get help from the Federal Reserve in the form of an interest rate cut, given that the import taxes will probably both boost inflation and weigh on GDP growth. Economists are divided on whether the central bank will prioritize prices or full employment. Economic data was mixed on Thursday. Initial jobless claims for the week through March 29 unexpectedly declined to 219,000 from un upwardly revised 225,000, but the continuing claims for the seven days to March 22 increased by more than estimated, to 1.90 million.The ISM services purchasing managers index (PMI) ticked down by more than expected. Yardeni Research projected that PCED inflation will accelerate to 3% to 4% over the rest of this year, with the potential for a quick deterioration of the labor market. If stagflation sets in, the firm expects it to last six months to a year. “The worst-case scenario is a recession if high tariff rates stick, leading to a slowdown in business and consumer spending that cause layoffs,” the firm wrote in a QuickTakes note. “We raised our odds of a stagflation/recession scenario from 35% to 45% on Monday.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Investors weren’t happy with President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, sending stocks plunging. The S&P 500 fell 4% at 10:14 a.m., the Nasdaq composite declined 5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 3.7%, or 1,556 points. For the Magnificent 7, declines in pre-market trading were 7.5% for Apple (AAPL-4.47%), 6.3% for Amazon (AMZN+2.38%), 4.7% for Meta (META+2.36%), 6.1% for Tesla (TSLA-3.42%), 5.7% for Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%), 2.8% for Microsoft (MSFT-0.62%), and 3% for Google’s (GOOGL+0.91%) parent Alphabet. The import taxes will be applied on a country-by-country basis. Chinese goods, for example, will be hit with a 34% levy, while products from the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties. Mexican and Canadian goods won’t face any additional charges. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Melisa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM-0.15%), told Quartz. The tariffs are “not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but could be very harmful for pockets of it.” Economic data was mixed on Thursday. Initial jobless claims for the week through March 29 unexpectedly declined to 219,000 from un upwardly revised 225,000, but the continuing claims for the seven days to March 22 increased by more than estimated, to 1.90 million. The ISM services purchasing managers index (PMI) ticked down by much more than expected for March to 50.8 from 53.5 in February, with the new orders measure dropping to 50.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. More stocks to watch today: Constellation Brands (STZ-0.57%), which makes, imports and distributes alcoholic beverages, is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Thursday. Revenue and per-share profit may have been little changed from a year earlier. The stock fell 0.6%.

Apparel maker Lululemon (LULU+0.28%) and Deckers (DECK-1.04%) Outdoor, which makes the Hoka and Teva brands, fell 13% and 17%, respectively for the same reason. PDD (PDD-5.11%) stock fell 4.3%.

Posted on 04/03/2025 3:57:27 AM PDT by hardspunned US stock futures plunged on Thursday as investors digested President Trump's announcement of a 10% tariff on all US trading partners, which has sent shockwaves through markets and the global trade order. S&P 500 futures (ES=F) dived 3.1%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) tumbled 2.5%, or over 1,000 points. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) led the sell-off, plummeting 3.5%. Apple (AAPL) shares fell sharply, while Nvidia (NVDA) and other chip stocks also tumbled amid concerns about disruption to their supply chains. China, a key supplier of components to such tech companies, was hit with additional US tariffs that raised its overall rate to 54%. (Excerpt) Read more at finance.yahoo.com ...

Title: Global Stocks Plunge on Larger-Than-Expected US Tariffs

Global stocks are slumping Thursday after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners that were worse that investors expected and raised fears of a growing trade war. U.S. stocks are plunging, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1,200 points. Investors are seeking haven trades such as Treasurys, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.06%. The Stoxx Europe 600 index ended 2.7% lower, while Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed down 2.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Also tumbling Thursday are Magnificent Seven stocks, led by an 8% plunge for Apple (AAPL), which Citi estimates makes more than 90% of its products in China. The country faces 54% in cumulative import tariffs. Shares of the rest—Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—all dropped. "The tariff announcement was worse than most investors expected," BNP Paribas Asset Management Chief Market Strategist Daniel Morris wrote in a note Thursday. "The key question now will be whether there is scope for negotiation on the reciprocal tariffs." UPDATE—April 3, 2025: This article has been updated to include refreshed share prices.

Title: Mag 7, other stocks fall post-market after Trump's tariff announcement

Investors greeted President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs less than enthusiastically, sending the Magnificent 7 and other stocks lower. Futures linked to the the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average point to a lower opening Thursday. For the Mag 7, stock price declines in post-market trading were 4.7% for Apple (AAPL-4.47%), 3.8% for Amazon (AMZN+2.38%), 3.7% for Meta (META+2.36%), 3.6% for Tesla (TSLA-3.42%), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%), 1.7% for Microsoft (MSFT-0.62%), and 2.4% for Google’s parent, Alphabet (GOOGL+0.91%). Palantir (PLTR+3.81%) fell 5.2%. General Motors (GM-2.47%) and Stellantis (STLA-5.81%) also moved lower. “One big question was: Did Trump really mean to impose the tariffs” or were they a feint aimed at drawing concessions, said Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM-0.15%). “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk.” That said, the implementation and effects of the tariffs are still not 100% clear, which will make it difficult for CEOs to plan, Brown told Quartz. The tariffs also make the Federal Reserve’s job much difficult because the levies could both increase costs and depress output. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties, according to a graph Trump held up at a news conference. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with respective duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free. The shares of PDD (PDD-5.11%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.9% in post-market trading. David Wagner, portfolio manager and head of equities at Aptus Capital, was less concerned about the tariffs, saying they’ll only affect about 15% of the economy — which continues to benefit from consumer strength and a strong labor market. “There’s a buffer here where consumers can absorb the tariffs and continue to spend,” Wagner said. He added that the strong dollar will help moderate the duties’ impact and that there’s “no playbook” for this situation. “No one knows the ramifications of tariffs and the threats and how other countries will react,” Wagner said.

Stocks fell on “Liberation Day,” when President Donald Trump is set to unveil new tariffs on virtually all countries with which the U.S. has a trading relationship. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both dropped about 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 116 points, or 0.3%. Tech shares were mainly lower ahead of the import-tax announcement. Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%) fell about 1.7% as of 10:12 a.m., Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL+0.91%) dropped 0.7%, Microsoft (MSFT-0.62%) was down 0.5%, Apple (AAPL-4.47%) and Amazon (AMZN+2.38%) both declined about 0.4% and Meta (META+2.36%) was off 0.3%. Tesla (TSLA-3.42%) fell after quarterly sales fell short of expectations. Palantir (PLTR+3.81%) gained 1.3%. The long-awaited reciprocal tariffs will be “effective immediately” after Trump announces them starting at 4 p.m. EDT, the White House said Tuesday. On Monday, Trump told reporters that he’s settled on a tariff plan, but declined to reveal details. One option was a 20% duty on virtually all imports, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-2.01%) reported. The White House has downplayed the possibility that Trump will make an announcement on additional sectoral tariffs on Wednesday, saying that while the president is still committed to them, he’ll roll them out later. Employers added 155,000 jobs in March, more than expected, increasing from an upwardly revised 84,000 in February, the ADP (ADP-1.47%) survey showed. Factory orders gained 0.6% in February, better than the consensus estimate but slowing from an upwardly revised 1.8% in January. Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler is scheduled to speak at 4:30 p.m. EDT on “Inflation expectations and monetary policymaking.” Some stocks to watch today: Newsmax stock plunged 41% after surging 179% yesterday to $233. The conservative cable news channel opened at $14 on Monday in its post-IPO trading debut. Tesla’s stock fell about 2.1% after Elon Musk’s EV-maker delivered about 336,000 vehicles in the first quarter, a 13% decline from a year earlier and far below analysts expectations for 390,000. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory dropped 11.5% year-on-year in March to 78,828. Many rivals, except for Ford (F-3.97%), have reported solid sales ahead of planned U.S. auto tariffs.
