“Very useful quantum computers are still a few decades away,” Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said during a keynote presentation at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas last week. His comment sent shockwaves through the quantum computing industry, with shares of leading companies like Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum and IonQ plummeting between 30 and 50 percent. These companies’ CEOs were quick to defend their industry in a bid to win back investor confidence. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “Jensen Huang has a misunderstanding of quantum. He is ‘dead wrong’ about D-Wave,” Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave Quantum, which develops quantum computing systems, told Observer. “There is more than one approach to building a quantum computer. Our (D-Wave) systems are performing scientific computations on important problems that are not solvable by even massively parallel GPU systems.” D-Wave uses quantum annealing, an approach that excels in solving specific computational optimization problems. This method is particularly useful for materials simulation, scheduling and logistics applications. “Commercial quantum computing is already here,” Baratz added. For example, Canada-based Pattison Food Group reduced an 80-hour scheduling task to 15 hours using D-Wave’s technology. Another client, NTT DOCOMO, Japan’s largest telecom provider, slashed the time to optimize network resources from 27 hours to just 40 seconds. Quantum computing CEOs are also talking up their companies’ revenue and profit prospects. D-Wave estimated its 2024 sales jumped 120 percent from the previous year. IonQ, which makes quantum computers, predicts it will turn a profit on more than $1 billion in sales by 2030, CEO Peter Chapman wrote in a blog post on Jan. 10. Quantum computing relies on qubits—units of data that can exist in multiple states at once—and holds the potential to quickly solve calculations that would take even supercomputers a thousand years. Exciting recent developments include Google’s Willow chip, which solved a random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark problem in just five minutes. RCS, one of the most challenging benchmarks for quantum computers, would take today’s fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years (1 followed by 24 zeros) to solve, Google claims. However, showcasing potential is different than consistently solving problems. “Quantum systems are highly susceptible to environmental noise, which can disrupt quantum computations. Nick Harris, CEO and co-founder of Lightmatter, an Alphabet-backed photonic computing startup, told Observer. “The breakthrough of Google’s Willow chip does not apply to all quantum computing hardware platforms, and the reality today is that scaling up is nowhere near a given.” Other major challenges include scaling qubit systems while preserving their coherence and connectivity, as well as improving qubit fidelity. “Even with error correction, individual qubit operations still carry a non-zero error rate. Reducing these errors further is essential for achieving reliable computations,” Harris explained. The quantum computing industry is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2035, according to McKinsey & Company. However, Huang’s remarks brought that lofty vision back down to earth. Huang predicted it would be 15 to 30 years before quantum computing is commercially viable. Daniela Herrmann, co-founder of Dynex, a quantum-as-a-service company, partially agrees with that assessment. “Huang’s extended timeline reflects the broader understanding of the challenges in achieving fully developed quantum systems, but it doesn’t fully acknowledge the progress being made by existing quantum-inspired applications,” Herrmann told Observer. She noted that Huang’s remarks seem to keep the spotlight on initiatives like Nvidia’s CUDA-Q, which is yet to solve real-world problems at scale. Quantum computing companies, including Phasecraft, Zapata Computing and Algorithmiq, are making notable strides in developing algorithms that can leverage the limited capabilities of existing quantum hardware. Moreover, advancements in quantum computation optimization are also being spearheaded by the University of Chicago and Stanford University, with recent initiatives focusing on optical computing and exploring its applications in quantum technologies. “Advanced language model A.I. tasks that previously required extensive resources are now being completed with 90 percent less computational overhead,” Herrmann said. “Many tangible business cases don’t necessarily require a universal (gate-model) quantum computer to provide advantages,” Anders Indset, chairman of Njordis Group, a VC firm investing in quantum technology companies, told Observer. “Recent sharp dip seems more like a near-term market correction than a final verdict on quantum’s future. ” Indset believes that Huang’s own economic interests in the field could influence his desire to slow down potential competitors. “While Jensen Huang’s caution may reflect the tough realities ahead, history shows that breakthroughs can come faster than expected,” he said. “A.I.’s voracious need for compute resources is pushing the industry to explore new hardware frontiers—quantum included. Once quantum machines achieve a certain threshold, they could supercharge A.I. by making specific training or inference tasks dramatically faster.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: NVIDIA’s AI GPU Export Control Rules Likely To Tighten Under Trump Admin, Says Analyst

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The Biden Administration's sweeping set of new rules that restrict AI chip sales to countries not aligned with US national security interests are unlikely to be watered down by the incoming Trump Administration, believes a Taiwan-based semiconductor analyst. The export control rules, which came soon after the CES conference in Las Vegas and amidst a fresh set of media reports outlining troubles with Blackwell GPU supplies, drew a sharp backlash from NVIDIA. The company, which commands an effective monopoly over the global AI chip supply chain, called the new export control rules an attempt to "undermine" American technology leadership by placing control of semiconductor exports in bureaucratic hands. The Biden Administration's latest rules divide the countries to which NVIDIA's advanced AI GPUs can be exported into three categories. The first is a list of nations that are either aligned with US national security objectives or are not a threat to the US. These countries can secure the chips without any hindrance. The second category consists of hostile nations such as Russia and Iran, which are completely barred from procuring either US-origin GPUs or AI software. Finally, the third category limits countries such as India from importing large amounts of GPUs without scrutiny. These nations will be able to import 1,700 GPUs without regulatory scrutiny, and they are designed to prevent the targeted countries from building large-scale data centers capable of advanced defense research. The rules also limit key AI software parameters, such as model weights, from being disclosed to nations. NVIDIA's response to them was hard-hitting, as it characterized the rules as threatening to "to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide." NVIDIA admitted that the new rules will not come into effect until 120 days but cautioned that they were already "undercutting U.S. interests." However, despite NVIDIA's praise of the previous Trump presidency in its comments, one analyst believes that the export rules are only set to tighten during the incoming administration. Sharing his thoughts on X, Taipei-based financial analyst Dylan Nystedt outlined several factors that make it unlikely that the issue "might go away under President Trump." He believes that the reality might be different, and "If anything, the rules are likely to become more extreme over time, not less." He starts off by sharing comments made by TSMC's founder, Dr. Morris Chang, in 2023, where he shared his thoughts and remarked that globalization is dead. Dr. Chang had made similar remarks in 2022 and saw a media mogul agree with him. In his 2023 remarks, the former TSMC boss had also supported American policy objectives of slowing down China's progress. Nystedt also believes that supercomputers are helping adversarial nations such as China and Russia to develop advanced military technologies. He outlined, "Supercomputers have already helped Russia and China develop hypersonic missiles, better jet planes and engines, improved nuclear modeling, more." As a consequence, the analyst outlines that the fear among Washington policy circles is that "AI will be able to help adversaries build far better weapons than engineering and design software has already done." He also shared a highly circulated image of a purported Chinese sixth-generation fighter aircraft prototype that appears to rival Northrop Grumman's Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform. According to Nystedt, NVIDIA is misguided in its criticism of the US government. He concludes by outlining that "In its [NVIDIA] zeal to drive computing forward for the good of mankind, it forgot evil exists in the world." Nvidia is unlikely to see any change to the new US export rules on ‘AI Diffusion’ unveiled Monday (1/13). It is not an issue that might go away under President Trump. It is a US National Security issue.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Quantum computing stocks climbed during Tuesday morning trading after plunging earlier in the week. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) stock was up by almost 30% on Tuesday morning, while Quantum Computing (QUBT) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) saw shares up by around 17% and 15%, respectively. IonQ (IONQ) shares climbed by around 2%. The stocks fell slightly closer to noon, with Rigetti up by around 13%, D-Wave up by around 9%, and Quantum Computing up by almost 6%. IonQ shares fell by more than 2%. Both D-Wave and Rigetti saw shares fall by more than 25% during mid-day trading on Monday after Meta (META) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg cast doubts on quantum computing’s potential in the near future. During an appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, which was published Friday, Zuckerberg said he sees the technology’s usefulness a “decade-plus out.” “I’m not really an expert on quantum computing — my understanding is that’s still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm,” Zuckerberg said. Quantum Computing shares fell by around 23%, while IonQ stock was down by more than 12% mid-day Monday. The previous week, the stocks also tanked after Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang shared similar sentiments that useful quantum computers are decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said during Nvidia’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” Huang said he sees the chipmaker, a major player in the artificial intelligence boom, playing “a significant part” in the development of quantum computers, which will be able to quickly solve problems that would take traditional computers thousands of years to complete. After Huang’s comments sent stocks falling, D-Wave chief executive Alan Baratz said the Nvidia chief “has a misunderstanding of quantum,” in a statement shared with Quartz. “While he might be right about other quantum companies, he is dead wrong about D-Wave,” Baratz said. “There is more than one approach to building a quantum computer. D-Wave took a different approach, which has allowed us to become commercial today and likely many years ahead of other quantum computing companies.” For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The Dow and other indices rebounded on Tuesday following inflation data that came in cooler than anticipated. AI stocks that declined sharply on Monday recovered early Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA+3.31%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.65%), Palantir (PLTR+3.77%), Micron Technology (MU+6.40%), and others all rising. According to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures wholesale inflation, increased by only 0.2% in December. This figure was lower than the projected rise of 0.4%. Additionally, the Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, remained unchanged. With that, all eyes are on Wednesday’s consumer price index (CPI) report, which measures retail inflation and will help determine whether or not the Fed will lower interest rates this year. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 218 points, or 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 shed 0.25% and 0.35%, respectively. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been rising in the past few days, declined slightly to 4.78%. Oil prices also decreased, with West Texas Intermediate falling by 0.7%, trading around $78.25 per barrel. This week holds significant events, including earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM+2.26%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+5.87%) on Wednesday, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM+2.56%) and UnitedHealth (UNH+0.16%) on Thursday. Bond markets are moving upward, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbing to 4.78% as investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve may delay lowering interest rates until 2026. This situation has also affected other economies. For instance, Japan, which tried to stabilize the economy and the yen last year, saw its 10-year government bond yield surpass 1%, reaching a 13-year high on Tuesday. Meanwhile, in the UK, 30-year gilt yields are at their highest levels since 1998. India, which is grappling with currency challenges as the rupee declines, saw its 10-year bond yield experience its biggest single-session rise in over a month on Monday, nearing a two-month high of 6.846%.

The S&P 500 is close to erasing all the gains it notched since Donald Trump’s election victory. As of market close on Monday, the S&P 500 was up just 0.92% since Nov. 5 — the day Trump clinched a second term in the White House and set off a stock market rally. S&P 500 futures were up 0.27% early Tuesday, pointing to a potential bounce back after sinking 0.77% so far in January. But if the index continues to close lower through Inauguration Day next Monday, it could represent the worst performance for the S&P 500 between Election Day and a presidential inauguration since 2009, when Barack Obama first took office during the Great Recession, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group reported by CNBC. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has also pared back its post-election gains in recent weeks, and is now only 0.18% higher than Nov. 5. That index is down 0.85% so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still up 3.52% since Election Day, although it has also seen some moderation in returns. A slump in tech stocks on Monday, including Nvidia (NVDA+3.31%) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.65%), following new Biden administration rules governing the sale of AI chips, sent the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lower. In 2025, the Nasdaq has also slumped 1.63%. Dow futures were up 115 points in pre-market trading Tuesday, while Nasdaq futures ticked up 0.33%. In the aftermath of the election, major U.S. indexes hit new records in a Trump-fueled market rally, with the Dow hitting 44,000 for the first time in its 128-year history and the S&P 500 crossing the 6,000 mark. Investors are also bracing for the start of fourth-quarter earnings, which will kick off Wednesday with major banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM+2.26%), Citibank (C+7.07%), and Wells Fargo (WFC+6.92%). The December Consumer Price Index, a key inflation gauge, is also set to be released Wednesday morning. Economic indicators will continue to have an outsized impact on trading as Wall Street prepares for fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks closed mixed on Monday, with Big Tech names paring losses as the dollar and bond yields climbed amid fading hopes for interest rate cuts ahead of this week's key consumer inflation reports. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) settled almost 0.2% higher after falling as much as 1% during the session, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4%. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) closed off their session lows, though most "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps fell during the session. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.8%, or more than 350 points. Stocks navigated another volatile session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading around 4.8% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X), in particular, coming under pressure. As of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025. That has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target. Meanwhile, oil prices rose to their highest levels in five months before paring gains after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry, threatening supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to $81.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled at $78.82. Elsewhere in corporates, Moderna (MRNA) stock plunged 16% after the biotech giant cut its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion amid soft demand for vaccines. Stocks ended the session mixed on Monday as Tech led the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lower. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to close up almost 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 0.8% as Energy (XLE) stocks and Industrials (XLI) rallied. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 2% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. Shares of Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) also fell, but closed well off their session lows. Investors scooped up shares of Tesla (TSLA) in the last hour of trading. Shares of the EV giant closed higher after falling as much as 2% earlier in the session. Tech has sold off in recent sessions as the market resets expectations over potential Fed rate cuts following a hotter-than-expected jobs report last Friday. Investors will be paying attention to two key data points this week. Tuesday will bring a reading on wholesale inflation before the more widely followed Consumer Price Index (CPI) is set for release on Wednesday morning. A surge in the US dollar has equity strategists expecting "FX headwinds" and other phrases about the strong dollar to be a heavily discussed topic this earnings season. With the US dollar continuing to strengthen, companies with large international exposure are likely to be discussing how their sales are weakening due to the foreign exchange crossover. But the equity research team at Goldman Sachs found an interesting point about when companies miss sales estimates due to FX headwinds. Their stocks don't underperform the market by nearly as much. Dating back to 2016, the Goldman equity strategy led by David Kostin found that companies who miss sales estimates on a constant currency basis see their stock underperform the market by 3.69% the next day. But if the miss isn't on a constant currency basis, meaning it hasn't been adjusted for the strong dollar, the company's stock only underperforms by 0.69%. So in some ways, the market often sees the headwind as a short-term one and isn't overly judgemental about it. Still, Kostin notes "companies with domestic-facing sales have typically outperformed firms with international-facing revenues in other periods of US dollar strength." Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Edison International (EIX) — the parent company of the utility Southern California Edison (SCE) — saw its stock drop more than 12% Monday following an announcement from SCE late last week that it's being investigated by California fire authorities for its potential link to the Los Angeles wildfires. SCE said in a statement Friday that the authorities are investigating whether its equipment "was involved in the ignition" of one of the wildfires in Los Angeles. The utility said one of its power lines fell Jan. 7 but that it "does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire." Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Shake Shack (SHAK) posted preliminary fourth quarter results that beat expectations, but investors don't seem convinced. Shares of the fast-casual chain fell 6% on Monday after the company reported same-store sales grew by 4.3% last quarter. Total revenue jumped around 15% year over year to $328.7 million. Shake Shack made a "lot of progress" this past year "in an environment where you still have concerns around wage inflation and potentially some commodity inflation, and you've got some risks that are kind of popping up here over the last few weeks [like the bird flu]," CEO Rob Lynch told Yahoo Finance at the ICR conference in Orlando, Fla. For 2025, it projects to expand restaurant margins to 22% from 21.4%, the highest margin in the last eight years. Read more here. Shares of Honeywell (HON) rose as much as 4% before paring gains on Monday after Bloomberg reported the industrial conglomerate is on track to proceed with a breakup amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. In December Honeywell said it was exploring strategic alternatives to unlock shareholder value, including separating its aerospace business. Honeywell is expected give an update on progress made when it reports its fourth quarter earnings on Febr 6. Shares of US Steel (X) jumped following news reports that rivals Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) and Nucor (NUE) are considering making a joint bid for the iconic steel-maker just weeks after the Biden administration blocked a takeover of the Pittsburg-based company by Japan's Nippon Steel. As part of the offer, Cleveland-Cliffs would buy US Steel in cash and then sell the company's Big River Steel mill in Arkansas to Nucor, according to people familiar with the matter as reported by the Financial Times. News of the joint bid consideration was first reported by CNBC. Cleveland-Cliffs reportedly plans to offer less than $40 a share to buy US Steel, far less than the $55 a share that Nippon Steel had agreed to pay for the company last year before the Biden administration blocked the merger citing national security concerns. US Steel stock jumped more than 5% on the news, while shares of Nucor and Cleveland-Cliffs also rose. Stocks came off their session lows by 1:00 p.m. ET on Monday with the major averages mixed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to fall more than 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. Tech stocks lagged as investors rotated out of the sector. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) erased losses of more than 2% to briefly flip above the flatline. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 2%. Social media company Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both fell more than 1%. Oil extended gains to a five-month high on Monday as worries grew over supply disruptions impacting big importers China and India from wide-ranging sanctions against Russian crude. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose roughly 2% to trade above $78 per barrel while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, surpassed $81, the highest level since August. The move higher comes after an almost 4% surge on Friday in reaction to wide-ranging sanctions against Moscow imposed by the US, targeting oil executives, traders, and more than 180 vessels, bringing the total number of ships sanctioned to 451, according to JPMorgan analysis. "There are indications that, similar to Indian refiners who avoid taking Russian oil in tankers under sanctions or in ships insured by sanctioned Russian insurers, China is also becoming a less-permissive buyer," wrote JPMorgan analysts in a recent note. Bitcoin (BTC-US) fell 3% over the past 24 hours to hover just below $92,000 per token. Enthusiasm for the token has waned in recent days as risk assets have sold off amid rising US Treasury yields and a higher US Dollar. Meanwhile bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (MSTR) bought about 2,530 tokens for $243 million between Jan.6 and Jan. 12, according to the company's latest filing. The company currently holds approximately 450,000 bitcoins. MicroStrategy stock slumped 4% on Monday. 'Magnificent 7' stocks led the tech sell-off on Monday as investor optimism over Federal Reserve rate cuts this year began to fade ahead of a highly anticipated inflation print this week. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 3% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. EV maker Tesla (TSLA) retreated around 1% while social media platform Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both shed more than 2%. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) posted smaller drops. Tech stocks extended their declines from Friday, which came as a hotter-than-expected jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed would cut rates at least two times this year. Investors expect policymakers to shift any easing to the fall at the earliest. Growth stocks lost ground as the yield on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) ticked higher and the US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB) rose to its highest level since 2022. Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH) rose nearly 4% on Monday morning, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) into positive territory in early trading. UnitedHealth, along with other insurers like Humana (HUM), rose after Medicare released a proposal that would allow for bigger-than-expected payments for insurance companies in 2026. Shares of CVS Health (CVS) also rallied. Moderna (MRNA) shares sank 23% at the open on Monday after the biotech giant lowered its 2025 sales guidance by $1 billion because of weak demand for its COVID-19 vaccines and a slower adoption of its new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shot. The company said it expects revenue in 2025 to come in anywhere between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion after hitting as much as $3.1 billion last year. Stocks opened lower on Monday, with tech leading the losses as optimism over interest rate cuts this year continued to fade and bond yields rose. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.1%. Stocks continued their sell-off from Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for the major averages. A hot December jobs report spooked the markets, as investors faced the possibility that the Federal Reserve will make just two rate cuts this year. Among Monday's laggards, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) slid more than 3% and 2%, respectively, as the "Magnificent Seven" group lost ground in the market sell-off. Economic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations (December) Earnings: KB Home (KBH) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning: The optimism over US banks is about to be put to the test Biden plans to tighten AI chip export rules Treasury sell-off ripples through world markets Elizabeth Warren has 180 questions for Trump Treasury pick Bessent TSMC fourth quarter profit seen jumping 58% on strong AI chip demand Moderna stock tumbles after cut to 2025 sales view Canada Has Counter-Tariffs Ready If Trump Launches Trade War, Trudeau Says Investors awake to markets continuing their post-red-hot jobs report tantrum. The rise in yields and now the rise in energy prices remain in focus. Both of these things happening at the same time is the worst possible scenario for the bulls. At the time of this writing, premarket weakness is being seen in top momentum names such as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). Important point this morning by the Goldman Sachs team: "The move in rates is also now tightening financial conditions such that it may weigh on growth and risk assets. Positions that benefit from lower US yields now look more attractive, especially for portfolios that already embrace the US growth theme." Sign in to access your portfolio

Technology stocks struggled across the board Monday, including declines among Magnificent 7 firms and a big hit to quantum computing stocks. The S&P 500 technology sector fell about 0.9%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished 0.4% lower. The decline follows broad market struggles on Friday after labor market data for December came in hotter than expected, leading investors to scale back their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. The Magnificent 7 were not spared, with Nvidia (NVDA) stock losing 2% and Apple (AAPL) and Meta Platforms (META) shares declining about 1%. The only member of the group in the green was Tesla (TSLA), with shares up 2%. Nvidia's drop came even as the chipmaker announced a series of AI healthcare partnerships with Mayo Clinic, IQVIA Holdings (IQV), and Illumina (ILMN) on Monday, as the Biden administration proposed new rules on exporting AI chips. Nvidia called the new restrictions, meant to limit AI chip sales to certain countries, "misguided" in a blog post Monday. Shares of quantum computing companies continued to slide Monday after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg followed the lead of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang with comments throwing cold water on the sector. In a Friday appearance on "The Joe Rogan Experience," Zuckerberg said he believes quantum computing is "still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm." That followed comments from Huang last week that "very useful quantum computers" are still 15 to 30 years away. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) shares plunged 32%, while D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) lost close to 34%, IonQ (IONQ) fell 14%, and Quantum Computing (QUBT) dropped 27%. UPDATE—Jan. 13, 2025: This article has been updated to include additional information on proposed U.S. export rules and reflect more recent share price values.

The stock market is in the red, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunging more than 1% on Monday morning as new regulatory measures introduced by President Biden have severely impacted artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. These changes have raised concerns among investors, leading to a sharp sell-off in AI-related companies. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, called the policies “unprecedented and misguided.” In a company blog post, he slammed the outgoing administration for jeopardizing global progress on AI. “In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review,” Finkle said. “This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally.” Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+3.31%) fell 3.7% on Monday as the Biden administration unveiled rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. Several AI-related stocks were also down on the Nasdaq, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.65%), Micron (MU+6.40%), and Palantir (PLTR+3.77%), with declines of 10%, 5.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Other tech stocks listed on the Nasdaq were also down Monday morning, with Apple (AAPL+1.95%), Meta (META+4.31%), and CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD+4.58%) down by 2.2%, 1.8%, and 1.9%, respectively. —Rocio Fabbro and Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. As the outgoing Biden administration significantly tightens the American noose around AI chips, narrowing NVIDIA's TAM in the process, HSBC is out today with a rare sobering take on the GPU maker's near-term prospects. To wit, HSBC analyst Frank Lee notes at the outset that NVIDIA will be "under increasing pressure to deliver an even stronger H2 FY26 ramp of its GB300/B300 platform" to counter the "potentially weaker H1 FY26 momentum." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's FY2026 roughly aligns with CY2025. Consequently, given the chipmaker's reduced sales-related momentum in the first half of 2025 vs. previously baked-in expectations, Lee now expects NVIDIA to sell ~35,000 NVL72-equivalent AI server racks in CY 2025 as opposed to HSBC's previous sales assumption of 41,500 AI racks, equating to lower full-year datacenter revenue estimate of just around $236 billion from an earlier estimation of $253 billion. Interestingly, Lee's bear-case scenario for NVIDIA entails full-year datacenter-related sales of "20K-25K NVL racks" and an EPS estimate of between $4.84 and $5.14, which "remains 8%/14% above consensus [estimate] of USD4.50." Lee goes on to note: "We lower our FY26 EPS estimates by 6% to reflect slower H1 FY26 Blackwell ramp." Given this reduced full-year EPS estimate, HSBC has trimmed its "target price [for NVIDIA shares] to USD185 (from USD195) based on an unchanged target FY26 PE of 32x." Of course, as stated earlier, HSBC's revisions are premised on a slower production ramp-up of NVIDIA's latest Blackwell architecture GPUs. Nonetheless, do note that Jensen Huang recently declared at the CES 2025 that "Blackwell is in full production" now. $NVDA White House confirms global curbs on exports of AI chips by Nvidia and its peers; No restrictions apply to chip sales to 18 key allies and partners; Trump administration to decide how and whether to implement curbs - Six key mechanisms in the rule catalyze the… — TradeTheNews.com (@Trade_The_News) January 13, 2025 Meanwhile, as stated earlier, the outgoing Biden administration has now significantly tightened the US export controls around AI chips: The Biden Administration's "AI Diffusion" rule will stifle innovation and undermine America’s global technology leadership. Restricting access to mainstream computing risks derailing AI progress for industries at home and abroad. America’s strength lies in innovation and… — NVIDIA (@nvidia) January 13, 2025 Given the significant sales-related implications of this measure, it is hardly a surprise that NVIDIA has slammed Biden administration's AI diffusion rules by declaring that they will "stifle innovation and undermine America’s global technology leadership." The statement goes on to note that "this rule will only harm the U.S. economy, set America back, and play into the hands of U.S. adversaries." Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell on Monday as a continued selloff in tech stocks extended losses sparked by stronger-than-expected job reports. In the late afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.78%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped 0.7% and 0.07%, respectively. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to a fresh high of 4.77%. Oil prices also surged 3.4%, with West Texas Intermediate reaching $79.2 per barrel, marking their highest levels since early October. This week holds significant events, including earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM+2.26%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+5.87%) on Wednesday, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM+2.56%) and UnitedHealth (UNH+0.16%) on Thursday. On the macroeconomic front, investors will keep an eye on the key inflation indicators, the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI), this week. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+3.31%) fell 3.7% on Monday as the Biden administration unveiled rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” Several AI-related stocks were also down, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI+1.65%), Micron (MU+6.40%), and Palantir (PLTR+3.77%), with declines of 10%, 5.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Shares of biotechnology company Moderna (MRNA+0.87%) plunged more than 23% after the company slashed its sales guidance for the year. Moderna now projects 2025 revenue between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion, a significant downgrade from its earlier forecast of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion posted in September. Shares of Lululemon (LULU-2.84%) surged 2.5% after the company raised its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue outlook, citing stronger-than-expected performance during the holiday season. The retailer now anticipates sales between $3.56 billion and $3.58 billion, up from its previous forecast of $3.48 billion to $3.51 billion. The update is a positive development for investors, as the athletic apparel company has faced sluggish sales over the past year. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT+3.07%) spiked one week before Donald Trump is set to return to the White House for his second term in office. Trump Media stock surged more than 21% on Monday afternoon, trading at $43.17 per share. That’s among the largest single-day jumps in the company’s share value since Trump won the presidential election. In the time since Nov. 5, shares of the company — which owns Trump’s right-wing social media platform, Truth Social — have climbed 21%. Despite stocks and cryptocurrencies rallying following Trump’s election victory, Trump Media shares, which had become something of a proxy for Trump’s election odds, had a surprisingly muted response to the election results. — Rocio Fabbro contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. When investing in high-growth stocks, names like Palantir Technologies (PLTR), Rigetti Computing (RGTI) and various tech companies are often mentioned. While Palantir is known for its data analytics platforms and is seen as the “new oil” by many investors, Rigetti is a leading company in quantum computing. It is developing technology that could revolutionize many industries, from pharmaceutics to cryptography. One such investor, at only 19 years old, has a clear vision for his financial future. With $3K to $4K or 33% of his portfolio, saved for high-growth buys, this young investor aims to hold these stocks for 10 to 15 years, but he wants to make an informed decision. Don't Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. “I would like to dedicate $3K-$4K (around 33% of my portfolio) to purchasing some long-term individual stocks with high growth potential. I plan to leave money in these for the next 10 years,” he wrote. He’s drawn to several high-growth buys, including PLTR, RGTI, BBAI and a few other 3D printing stocks, but he’s unsure whether these are a good bet. Because he’s found himself at such a pivotal moment, he sought advice in Reddit’s r/investing community, mentioning that his goal is to secure growth over at least a decade – or more. As the Reddit community rallied to offer advice, the comment section became a debate field, with commenters disputing whether these high-risk, high-reward picks are right or whether a more diversified strategy would better serve the 19-year-old. See Also: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Let’s review the most common suggestions Redditors have given the young investor. Better Start With An Index Fund Like VOO, VTI or SPY Many commenters in the thread recommended the investor put his money into an index fund like VOO, SPY or VTI because they are simple to use and control, offer diversification and have growth potential in the long run. “The fact that you ask someone else what you should invest in means an index fund like VOO or SPY is right for you. This way, you don't have to analyze companies or do any of the tedious due diligence,” the very first comment reads. One Reddit member suggested that an index fund would be a better bet in almost all investing cases, mentioning VOO and VTI as his favorite. “In almost all cases, buying an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund ... a.k.a, a basket of stocks all owned under one ticket) is your best bet. VOO and VTI are my two favorites (VOO tracks the S&P 500, VTI tracks the total U.S. market),” the Redditor said. A third Redditor shared his investing experience, saying that he’s spent a lot of time researching and picking individual stocks, but only three beat VOO when he sold 15 of them. “I backtested my stocks and of the 15 or so stocks I sold, only three beat the S&P 500. If I had put all that money in VOO or VTI, I would have made more money than I did in individual stocks. Considering the time, stress and effort I put into individual stocks I came out way behind,” the Redditor’s comment reads. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Buy blue chip stocks for Long-Term Growth and Allocate a Smaller Portfolio Slot to Speculative Stocks Blue chip stocks like Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia were mentioned throughout the comments, as the Redditors who suggested them see these stocks as stable and profitable in the long run. “I'm about 80% S&P, 15% MSFT, 5% NVDA. Microsoft is one of those companies that rarely misses and I'll always hold it in my portfolio. Nvidia just makes sense to have for the next 5-10 years,” a comment says. Another commenter recommended Microsoft and Nvidia because, according to him, the companies holding them have solid fundamentals. “If you're thinking 10-15 years, consider looking into companies with solid fundamentals, like MSFT, NVDA or even some high-growth ETFs,” he says. Several Reddit members also suggested allocating a smaller portion of one’s portfolio to speculative stocks like RKLB, PLTR or RGTI. “RKLB will hit $100 a share by January 2026,” a comment reads. One Redditor recommended adding PLTR to the portfolio but emphasized how important diversification is. “PLTR could be a play but don't ignore the value of diversification,” he says. Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio. In October 2024, Arrived sold The Centennial, achieving a total return of 34.7% (11.2% average annual returns) for investors. Arrived aims to continue delivering similar value across our portfolio through careful market selection, attentive property management, and thoughtful timing in sales.

Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) shares dipped 3% in pre-trading on Monday, which would technically put them on the cusp of entering correction territory after a 10% drop from recent highs. The slide reveals bigger headwinds in the broader market, stemming from rising Treasury yields and innovative U.S. export restrictions on AI technologies. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The Biden administration's new rules ban the export of AI tech to countries like Israel, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and the UAEwith China, Russia, and others still barred. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said preserving U.S. dominance in AI development and chip design was a key reason. Nvidia strongly criticized the restrictions, describing them as a 'regulatory morass' preventing American innovation. In a blog post, the vice president of the company's government affairs, Ned Finkle, accused the administration of stifling competition and risking losing the Edge on the nation's technology. Nvidia gets 40% of its revenue in the U.S. and 15% each from Taiwan and China. HSBC analyst Frank Lee also cut his price target to $185 a share but maintained a 'buy.' Lee said Nvidia's potential headwinds in the first half of its fiscal year, beginning February, may necessitate a stronger second half performance to meet expectations. Lee also lowered Nvidia's expected data centre revenue for the fiscal year to $236 billion from $253 billion and cut the company's sales estimates on the NVL 72 AI server racks to 220k. However, Lee said Nvidia still beats Wall Street consensus to beat earnings per share in the most likely bear case scenario. All those regulatory shifts and blunted analyst tips have made Nvidia generally caution about this near-term growth. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Nvidia can't wait for Trump as it bashes Biden's 'misguided' AI rules — and the stock falls

Nvidia (NVDA+3.31%) on Monday quickly slammed newly released Biden administration rules to regulate chip sales to foreign countries. The White House published a swath of new guidelines early Monday to curb the sale of AI chips from U.S. firms such as Nvidia to specific countries and companies. The administration said the rules would “strengthen U.S. security and economic strength.” But Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, called the policies “unprecedented and misguided.” In a company blog post, he slammed the outgoing administration for jeopardizing global progress on AI. “In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review,” Finkle said. “This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally.” Nvidia stock fell almost 3% in pre-market trading Monday. Under the new guidelines, 18 key U.S. allies and partners would not be affected by the restrictions. Companies that meet high security and trust standards set by the U.S., and are headquartered in countries that are considered close allies and partners, would have the chance to obtain “Universal Verified End User” (UVEU) status. This designation would allow them to locate parts of their computational power in allied countries, and buy up to 320,000 advanced GPUs over the next two years. Nvidia argued that these controls are an overreach, and would “do nothing to enhance U.S. security.” “Rather than mitigate any threat, the new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead,” Finkle said. At the same time, Finkle praised the first Trump administration for laying “the foundation for America’s current strength and success in AI, fostering an environment where U.S. industry could compete and win on merit without compromising national security.” With President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in exactly one week, Big Tech leaders from Google (GOOGL+3.23%) chief Sundar Pichai to Meta (META+4.31%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg have been cozying up to Trump. They’re hoping to benefit from favorable policies, more lax regulation, and a pro-innovation environment that they hope will allow them to go full steam ahead on their AI ambitions — and beyond. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang himself said last week week that he’s ready to meet with the incoming Trump administration to help with AI policy. “I’d be delighted to go see him and congratulate him, and do whatever we can to make this administration succeed,” Huang told Bloomberg Television about Trump. He added that he has not yet been invited to meet with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort. — Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tech led a slide in US stock futures on Monday, while the dollar and bond yields climbed amid fading hopes for interest-rate cuts ahead of this week's key consumer inflation report. S&P 500 futures (ES=F) sank 0.8%, while those on the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) tumbled 1.2%. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), which includes fewer tech stocks, fell 0.3%. Stocks are shaping up for another rough session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report has rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading close to 4.8%, and the 30-year yield (^TYX) neared 5% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X) in particular coming under pressure. As of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025. That has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target. Adding to the gloom, oil prices rose around 2% to their highest levels in five months after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry than expected, risking supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to over $81 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) changed hands above $78. On the corporate front, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) slid as all the "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps lost ground in the market turmoil. Europe's largest pension fund revealed that it sold its entire stake in Tesla over CEO Elon Musk's pay package. Investors awake to markets continuing their post-red-hot jobs report tantrum. In focus remains the rise in yields and now, the rise in energy prices. Both of these things happening at the same time is the worst possible scenario for the bulls. At the time of this writing, pre-market weakness is being seen in top momentum names such as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). Important point this morning by the Goldman Sachs team: "The move in rates is also now tightening financial conditions such that it may weigh on growth and risk assets. Positions that benefit from lower US yields now look more attractive, especially for portfolios that already embrace the US growth theme." Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: TSMC fourth-quarter profit seen jumping 58% amid strong AI chip demand

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Wen-Yee Lee and Faith Hung TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is expected to report a 58% leap in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday because of surging demand. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from the megatrend towards AI. But the Taiwanese company faces headwinds from U.S. government technology restrictions on China and uncertainty about President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration, which has threatened broad import tariffs. TSMC is set to report a net profit of T$377.95 billion ($11.41 billion) for the quarter ended Dec. 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 22 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2023 fourth-quarter net profit of T$238.7 billion. TSMC last week reported a jump in fourth-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, comfortably beating market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in U.S. dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday. Brett Simpson, Arete Research co-founder and senior analyst, said 2025 will be another year where TSMC's growth is largely driven by AI customers. "From the U.S. government perspective, Arete is optimistic that TSMC can build a good relationship with the new administration particularly given its new fab cluster in Arizona is the biggest foreign direct investment project in the U.S. at present," he added. TSMC is spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, including $65 billion on three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona, though it says most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. Edward Chen, chairman of Fubon Financial's securities investment unit, said progress on the Arizona fab and its yield rates, or the percentage of usable chips, would be crucial for the company. "Additionally, the impact of tariffs to be imposed by the incoming Trump administration on demand remains to be seen," he added. TSMC, at its earnings call, will update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure as it races to expand production. On its last earnings call in October, TSMC said capital expenditure was likely to be higher in 2025 than last year, though it did not provide a figure. On the call, it predicted 2024 capital expenditure as being slightly higher than $30 billion. The AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock soaring 81% last year, compared with a 28.5% gain for the broader market.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Dell Technologies (DELL) Has ‘A Lot Of Upside’ If You Have Patience

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. “Stocks don’t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that’s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it’s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.” If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it’s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea “bogus” and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. “The simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they’re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that’s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,” Cramer added. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he is talking about these days. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock market data on a laptop screen. Photo by Alesia Kozik Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 60 Jim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL). Here is what he said: “Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) did not have a good quarter. It really was a disappointing quarter. I agree with people, even though I think the world of Michael Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL). However, I think Dell’s second half will be much better. I do not think much of its first half. If you have the patience to own the stock here, I don’t think there’s a lot of downside, and I think there’s a lot of upside. However, we own other stocks in the portfolio that I think are better, even at this price. Do you know that I actually like Nvidia at 134 more than I like Dell? Just saying.” In the most recently reported quarter, Dell’s Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) posted an impressive 34% year-over-year growth, reaching $11.4 billion in revenue. The server business rose a whopping 58% increase YoY to $7.4 billion. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) experienced a shift in AI server demand toward the next-generation Blackwell architecture. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s management highlighted that there was a dramatic shift in orders toward Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell-based systems during Q3, which impacted short-term shipments as these products ramp up production. This shift shows Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s competitive position, as customers are willing to wait for the latest tech solutions. Dell secured $3.6 billion in AI server orders this quarter, an 11% increase from the previous quarter. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) also signed over 2,000 enterprise customers for their AI solutions. Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) was a top contributor despite reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings results, because investors looked through the near-term disappointment and expected strong growth from AI-related servers and personal computers. We expect Dell to participate in the growth of artificial intelligence hardware, especially as enterprises invest more aggressively. We like the company’s depth and breadth of products and services, as well as its focus on keeping costs low.” Overall, DELL ranks 7th on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of DELL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DELL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In these shaky times, investors can enhance their portfolio returns by adding stocks backed by solid financials and long-term growth opportunities. The investment thesis of top Wall Street analysts can inform investors as they pick the right stocks, as pros base their analysis on a strong understanding of the macro environment and company-specific factors. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their performance. We start with ride-sharing and food delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). The company delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the third quarter of 2024, though gross bookings fell short of expectations. Recently, Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated a buy rating on Uber Technologies stock with a price target of $90. The analyst sees 2025 as a year of investment for UBER. While these investments could impact the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the near term, they are expected to fuel long-term growth. Based on his analysis, Lee expects Uber's growth investments to drive a compound annual growth rate of 16% in core gross bookings from FY23 to FY26, in line with the company's analyst-day target of mid- to high-teens growth. The analyst is confident that Uber's EBITDA growth is on track with its analyst-day target of high-30s to 40% CAGR. "Despite leaning into growth investments, economies of scale and increased efficiency should offset margin risks," said Lee. Additionally, Lee thinks that worries over the growth of the company's Mobility business seem overstated. The analyst expects FY25 gross bookings growth (forex neutral) in the high-teens, with the pace of deceleration moderating compared to the second half of 2024. Further, the analyst projects the gross bookings for Uber's Delivery business to remain in the mid-teens in FY25. This increase is expected to be supported by the growing adoption of new verticals while maintaining the food delivery market share. The analyst added that Mizuho's checks revealed that order frequency has reached another all-time high. Checks also indicate solid grocery adoption in the U.S., Canada and Mexico along with robust user penetration. Lee ranks No. 324 among more than 9,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.9%. See Uber Technologies Stock Charts on TipRanks. We move to Datadog (DDOG), a company that offers cloud monitoring and security products. In November, the company announced better-than-anticipated results for the third quarter of 2024. On Jan. 6, Monness analyst Brian White reiterated a buy rating on Datadog stock with a price target of $155. The analyst thinks that the company has a more balanced approach toward the generative artificial intelligence trend, "avoiding the absurd claims propagated by many across the software complex." He noted that DDOG fared well compared to its peers in a challenging software backdrop in 2024, but added that it lagged behind other stocks in Monness' coverage universe. That said, White thinks that Datadog, and the broader industry, will start to see incremental activity over the next 12 to 18 months from the long-term boom in generative AI. Highlighting DDOG's outperformance compared to peers and its transparency with regard to its generative AI progress, the analyst noted that AI-native customers accounted for more than 6% of the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) in Q3 2024, up from over 4% in Q2 2024 and 2.5% in Q3 2023. White also highlighted some of the company's AI offerings, including LLM Observability and its gen AI assistant, Bits AI. Overall, the analyst is bullish on Datadog and thinks that the stock deserves a premium valuation compared to traditional software vendors due to its cloud-native platform, rapid growth and robust secular tailwinds in the observability space, as well as its new generative AI-led growth opportunities. White ranks No. 33 among more than 9,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 20%. See Datadog Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) is this week's third stock pick. The company is considered one of the major beneficiaries of the generative AI wave and is experiencing stellar demand for its advanced GPUs (graphics processing units) that are required to build and run AI models. Following a fireside chat with Nvidia's CFO Colette Kress, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reaffirmed a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $170. The analyst highlighted the CFO's assurance that the ramp-up in the production of the company's Blackwell platform is on track despite supply chain challenges, thanks to solid execution. Moreover, the company expects spending in the data center space to remain strong in calendar year 2025, supported by the Blackwell ramp-up and broad-based strength in demand. Further, Sur noted that management sees massive revenue growth opportunities, as it grabs a larger chunk of the $1 trillion-worth datacenter infrastructure installed base. Sur added that Nvidia expects to benefit from the shift to accelerated computing and growing demand for AI solutions. Management thinks that the company has a solid competitive advantage compared to ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) solutions due to several strengths, including ease of adoption and its comprehensive system solutions.

Title: Jobs Report: Bond Yields Rise And Stocks Fall
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/12/jobs-report-bond-yields-rise-and-stocks-fall/

The U.S. economy shows positive momentum, with robust job growth in last Friday's payrolls report. ... [+] The resilient growth removes almost any chance of another Federal Reserve rate cut soon. The robust and much higher-than-expected employment growth in the December jobs report on Friday essentially wiped out any thoughts of another Federal Reserve rate cut on January 29. Job growth continued to bounce back from the hurricanes and strike-impacted October data. The economy entered 2025 with some momentum, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 2.7% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 256,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, but not enough to diminish the strong report. The household survey data was even more impressive, with a gain of 478,000 jobs, and the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 102,000. Monthly Job Growth Wage growth was a little below expectations at 3.9% year-over-year, down from 4.0% last month. The average workweek hours were unchanged at 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Work Hours & Wage Growth The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. Initial filings are nearing the lows of 2024. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired relative to early 2024. Initial Jobless Claim The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%. Before the decline from the August 2024 unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Last month, the rate was within a whisker of triggering the Sahm Rule again, but the December unemployment decline moved it away from danger. U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The decline in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the economy's health, and the monthly reading improved in December. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to a 52-week closing high of 4.76% in response to the resilient employment report. At 2.29%, real, after-inflation expectations, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are now above the average during the 1999 to 2008 period and well above the post-global financial crisis period. 10-Year U.S. Treasury: Nominal & Real Yield Stocks had a down week and erased their year-to-date gains due to higher bond yields and an expectation of fewer Fed rate cuts. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), had a similar move lower. Stock Returns Though the outperformance declined slightly after the jobs report, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. The more economically sensitive small-capitalization stocks and banks underperformed this week, so some cracks might be forming. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks This week, Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index inflation report is a crucial economic report. Consensus estimates expect December CPI to rise to 2.9% year-over-year from 2.7%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should, combined with the robust jobs report, slam the door shut on any thought of a 0.25% cut at the January 29 meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expectations for total Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 from two to just one 0.25% cut. Further, no Fed rate reductions are forecasted until at least mid-year. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While the robust Friday jobs report would seemingly be good news, investors sent stocks lower and bond yields higher. Stocks often agitate for lower rates from the Federal Reserve, as easy money tends to feed speculation. In addition, bond yields have been moving higher, which can weigh on valuations. If higher yields are accompanied by economic growth and better corporate earnings, stocks can shake them off over time. While bond yields might continue to move higher, current yields have begun to look attractive when viewed through the expected after-inflation return. Wednesday’s CPI report could add to the upward pressure on bond yields. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Index Funds? Nope. We’re Doing This For 8%+ Tech Dividends And Upside

Investor managing portfolio. Pie chart and candlestick charts. We need to talk about tech stocks. Because, yes, there is a risk of a pullback here. But there’s also a way for us to minimize that risk—and grab 8%+ dividends, plus price upside, as we do so. First off, let me be clear that when I say “tech stocks,” I’m using the NASDAQ 100 as my benchmark. The index is about 60% tech, compared to about a third for the S&P 500. That higher level of tech exposure has allowed the NASDAQ to handily beat the S&P 500 over the long run That outperformance started to slow last year, with the NASDAQ only barely edging out the S&P 500. And as I write this, the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio is 37.2, higher than at any point since the dot-com bubble and well above the S&P 500’s measure of 27.9. Why the stretched valuation? The first thing that comes to mind is AI, which is already driving efficiencies outside the tech sector, such as in manufacturing, law and medicine. Meantime, the existence of open-source models, plus fierce competition between tech firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others, shows that AI will keep falling in cost, which could slow the continued rise of the large-cap AI stocks. This, by the way, is part of our 2025 AI-investing strategy at CEF Insider: Spread our money across high-yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold big-cap AI names and also invest in companies outside tech that are poised to profit from the technology’s continued growth. Our Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), for example, yields right around 9% now and not only holds firms like Microsoft, Alphabet and NVIDIA (NVDA), but also stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which stands to benefit as AI helps its portfolio managers make better decisions. ADX also holds Visa (V), which is using AI to improve fraud detection, lower costs and boost its margins. Another reason we could see a pullback in the NASDAQ this year is due to the resurgence of cryptocurrency driving unsustainable spending in the tech sector. We saw this in 2021, when surges in Bitcoin prices drove upward momentum on the NASDAQ. Then the bubble popped in 2022, and the NASDAQ slumped in sympathy. With Bitcoin surging again, we could be at the start of another, similar cycle. Consider, for example, the inclusion of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in the NASDAQ 100. The stock is basically a Bitcoin proxy, and while it did surge on the announcement that it would join the index, it plummeted shortly after. To be sure, one risky, unprofitable stock like MicroStrategy taking a tumble isn’t a major issue on its own (except to the people who own it, of course!). But if the stock is part of a broader index, it’s a risk to anyone investing in that index more broadly. This is a big reason why we prefer CEFs for investing in both tech and across the market—our funds’ active managers can navigate around risks like MicroStrategy, while index funds must hold the entire index at all times. Moreover, looking ahead to 2025, if the NASDAQ falls behind the S&P 500 this year, more investors are likely to look for other ways to get tech exposure, beyond a NASDAQ index fund, and actively managed CEFs, with their high dividends, are likely to have a lot of appeal. Speaking of dividends, tech-focused CEFs yield around 8% on average, as I write this. That high cash payout lets you capture profits from tech stocks more easily than you could with a NASDAQ-100 index fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ)—current yield 0.5%—where a selloff could erase your “paper gains.” Below we see the market prices of two tech CEFs through 2024: the 8%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple, and the 12%-paying (and private equity–focused) BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in orange. The benchmark index fund, QQQ, is in blue BST Total Returns Looking at this, you might feel dissatisfied that BST underperformed the NASDAQ 100—could that suggest this CEF isn’t worth buying now? Before jumping to this conclusion, remember that we’re looking at the total return–based market prices here (or the returns based on these funds’ prices on the stock market, including dividends). If we look deeper, at our two CEFs’ total return–based net asset values (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios, including dividends received), we see that BST more or less matched the index (while returning a big slice of its gain in cash, thanks to its high dividend), while BSTZ actually trailed a bit: Total Return on NAV It makes sense that BSTZ is slightly behind when looking at these funds based on their portfolios, rather than their market prices, as this fund holds a large portion of private-equity assets that are still lagging as their recovery takes longer to realize. This chart also suggests BST, which sports an 8% discount to NAV (or the gap between its market price and NAV), is a great buy now. But more crucially, both BST and BSTZ have an advantage over the NASDAQ 100 that is now becoming increasingly valuable: They aren’t directly exposed to crypto. Unlike the NASDAQ 100, neither fund has a position in MSTR, and they don’t invest in other volatile crypto firms, either. So if we see 2025 turn into a repeat of 2022 for cryptocurrencies, BST and BSTZ should fare much better than the index. And even if that doesn’t happen, the risks of a NASDAQ downturn are still likely to have a much lesser impact on these well-managed funds.

nouveau, nvidia, ретро Есть такая карта При загрузки модуля nouveau на экране даже не изображение, а что-то странное и постепенно гаснет. Т.е. режим некорректно устанавливается При этом fbset показывает такое Но если вместо загрузить nvidiafb, то всё корректно вносите местного шлимазла который утверждал что на старых-то картах нуво работает нормально Когда-то давно нормально работало, во всякие tuxkart, tuxracer и думы поиграть можно было. Именно с nouveau Когда-то давно нормально работало Тогда и nouveau был другим. Груз обратной совместимости мешает развитию, есть такое мнение. Так что, есть какая-то возможность насильно скормить nouveau какой-нибудь modeline или типа того? В параметрам modinfo сходу не нахожу подобного.
