Title: GraniteShares Announces Reverse Split of CONI

July 29, 2025 17:31 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for the GraniteShares 2x Short COIN (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the reverse split. After the close of the markets on August 14, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Effective after the close of markets on the Payable Date, the Fund’s CUSIP will change as noted in the table below: The reverse share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on August 14, 2025 (the “Record Date”), and payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a reverse split-adjusted basis on August 15, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately twenty-times higher. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747, or visit the website at www.graniteshares.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer.

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Once again, equities rose for the week (ended July 25th) with the S&P 500 up nearly 1.5%, the Nasdaq just over 1.0%, the Dow just under 1.3%, and even small cap stocks participated (Russell 2000 +0.9%).1 The month to date numbers are positive for each index in the +1.4% to +4.0% range. 2025 year to date appears to be favoring the tech heavy indexes (S&P 500 and Nasdaq) but not so much the old-time industrials (DJIA) or small caps (Russell 2000). Six of the Magnificent 7 rose on the week with Tesla (TSLA -4.1%) the only laggard.2 Microsoft (MSFT) closed on Friday at a new record high and Nvidia posted a new high on Thursday (July 24th). It’s been quite a run for stocks since the April lows. Two stocks that don’t seem to be participating are Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). Apple is off its high by more than -17% and Tesla twice that (-34%).2 And both are off double digits year to date. The table shows that three of the seven (NVDA, MSFT, and META) are up more than 20% this year. Amazon and Google are also up, but in the single digit range.2 Meanwhile, the White House has reached an agreement with Japan, setting tariffs on Japanese imports at 15%.1 Markets reacted positively to that news and now await word on negotiations with the European Union (EU), the results of which appear to be coming shortly. The economies in the EU are softening and the European Central Bank (ECB) has moved their policy rate to 2%, the mid-point of their neutral range. Unlike the ECB, the Fed’s current reference rate (the Fed Funds Rate), at 4.25% to 4.50%, is significantly above the Fed’s stated 2% neutral rate.3 The Fed appears to have some catching-up to do. We don’t have to review the political theater that has been playing out between President Trump and Fed Chair Powell as it’s been all over the news. The independence of the Fed from a sitting Administration was written into the 1913 law establishing the Fed.4 [Imagine the economic damage and resulting inflation if sitting U.S. Presidents controlled the Fed!] The Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) whose next meeting is in the last week of July, is composed of 12 members. They are the seven members of the Board of Governors (nominated by the sitting President and confirmed by the Senate), the President of the NY Fed, and four of the eleven remaining Regional Federal Reserve Bank Presidents (on a rotating basis).5 Powell, while Chair and with a great deal of influence, is only one of the 12 votes on the FOMC. So even if Powell wanted to lower, it isn’t a slam dunk. The Fed knows that it takes several months for its policy changes to have a significant economic impact. A good example is mortgage rates. A lower Fed Funds Rate would likely push mortgage rates down, but the impact on the economy is slow (mortgage by mortgage). As noted below, housing has become slow, so, it would behoove the Fed to lower rates. Thus, as emerging data show a slowing economy, it is only fitting that they lower the Fed Funds Rate. But the Fed knows that its independence is of utmost importance. As a result, we expect the Fed to maintain the Fed Funds Rate where it is (4.25%-4.50%) at its late July meeting if for no other reason than to reassert its independence from the Administration. Markets agree. The Market’s odds of a rate decrease at the July meeting are a scant 2.6%.3 It is also clear that the President now realizes that he can’t force the Fed, that the Fed values its independence and will fight for it, and that if he wants lower interest rates, he will have to wait until the Fed’s September meeting (market odds of a September rate cut are 62%, as the market sees a softening economy making headline news at that time).3 Thus, it behooves the President to stop discussing monetary policy and lay off criticizing the Chairman. If that were to occur, and the Fed lowers in September, the economy would benefit. New home sales rose +0.6% in June to a 627K annual rate.6 But that’s where the good news ends. The consensus expectation was 650K, and the small rise in June barely dented the huge -11.6% falloff in May. The combined May/June performance was the worst two-month performance since late 2022. Inventory levels of those new, unsold, homes were at 9.8 months’ supply at existing sales rates, up from 8.5 months in April and 9.7 in May. As a result, the average price for new homes fell by -2.1% in June from May levels while the median price was off -4.9% from May and down -3.0% from a year ago. Things were no better in the existing home space. Home prices fell -2.7% in June from May levels and existing home sales are now below the levels that occurred at the beginning of the last three Recessions. So, this is a Big Deal! The months’ supply, at current sales rates, has risen from 3.5 months in February to 4.7 months currently, and Zillow reports that 25% of its listings reduced their asking price in June, the highest level for a June month since 2018. It is hard to not conclude that deflation is in the immediate future for residential real estate. Of greater concern here is that the value of that personal residence is the major asset for the vast majority of U.S. households, and lower values will impact future consumption via the “wealth effect,” i.e., consumers spend more/less when their net worth rises/falls. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) fell again in June (-0.3%), are down -4% from a year ago, and have been constantly negative for the past three years.7 While some may say these measures are obsolete, we still believe that they impart value to the overall economic picture. Currently, this index is at a ten-year low. It peaked in December 2021 and is down -17.8% since. The Philadelphia Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index came in at -10.3 for July (somewhat better than June’s -25.0, but still negative).8 It has been negative for nine months in a row, and its expectations index for six months hence, at -3.9, has also been negative for six months in a row. The Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index fell to -20 in July from -8 in June. Market expectations were for a -2 reading.9 And the Chicago Fed’s National Activity index (a model with 85 variables) showed up at -0.1 in June, negative now for three months in a row. Companies employing 100 or more must notify workers 60 days prior to layoffs. This is called Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN). Such notifications are up +23% over the past year. This means that weakness will be showing up in the employment data as the year progresses. Equity markets continue to march higher despite growing evidence of a slowing economy. Housing sales, both from new construction and from existing units have slowed precipitously and clearly need lower mortgage rates. Such rates are tied to the 10 Year Treasury yield. Other indicators show slippage in the economy. The Conference Board’s LEI, the Philly Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index, the Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index, and the Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index have all been negative for several months. And higher layoffs appear to be just around the corner. Under normal circumstances, the Fed would be moving smoothly toward ease. But these aren’t “normal” times. Recent pressure by the White House on Chairman Powell has put the Fed’s independence in question and at risk. And, while the President has recently backed off, to put an exclamation point on the Fed’s independence, even at the risk of raising the odds of a Recession, it is highly likely that the Fed will not move rates lower at their late July meeting. The market’s odds of a July rate decrease recently fell to 2.6%!3 The next Fed meeting is in September. If the economy really deteriorates, there could be an inter-meeting move lower for the Fed Funds Rate, but that’s highly unlikely. So, as things now stand, the Fed’s next rate reduction will likely occur in September. Stay tuned. Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: Nvidia Orders 300,000 AI Chips as Sales Expected to Resume in China

Nvidia (NVDA) ordered 300,000 chipsets from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), as the chipmaker prepares to resume sales in China amid strong demand in the country, a Reuters report said. The order is for Nvidia’s H20 chips, a less-powerful AI chip tailored to meet U.S. export restrictions. Sales of the H20 in China were effectively banned earlier this year when the Trump administration instituted licensing requirements, but President Donald Trump seemed to reverse course following a recent meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon,” the chipmaker said on July 14. Nvidia’s significant TSMC order adds to the company’s existing H20 stockpile of 600,000 to 700,000 chips, the report said. Sources familiar with the matter reportedly said strong Chinese demand for the chips led Nvidia to make the additional order. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment to Investopedia. TSMC did not immediately respond. Shares of Nvidia were little changed shortly after the opening bell Tuesday but have increased in value by nearly a third in 2025.

U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq again hit record closing highs; Union Pacific (UNP) agrees to acquire fellow rail giant Norfolk Southern (NSC) for $85 billion; UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares are falling in premarket trading after it slashes its full-year profit outlook; Nvidia (NVDA) reportedly orders 300,000 H20 chips from contract manufacturer TSMC (TSM) amid strong demand in China; and United Parcel Service (UPS) shares are dropping after its quarterly profit comes up short of analysts' estimates. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are edging higher after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq again hit record highs, as investors monitor incoming earnings reports. Nasdaq futures are 0.5% higher after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high for the 10th time in 11 sessions, while S&P 500 futures are up 0.3% after its sixth-straight record close. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are little changed. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly higher at about $118,500. The 10-year Treasury note yield is slightly lower. Gold futures are higher. Oil futures are little changed. Union Pacific (UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NSC) announced that the two railroad giants were combining, creating the country's first transcontinental railroad. Union Pacific will buy Norfolk Southern for $320 per share in an $85 billion deal that will connect 50,000 miles of railroad across 43 states, linking approximately 100 North American ports. The combined company will be worth over $250 billion. The deal follows reports that the two companies were in merger discussions. Union Pacific shares are up less than 1% in premarket trading, while those of Norfolk Southern are down more than 2%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares are slipping 1.5% after the health insurance giant slashed its full-year profit outlook as its second-quarter earnings came in well below analysts' estimates. The insurer posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.06 on revenue that increased about 13% year-over-year to $111.6 billion, both below analyst projections compiled by Visible Alpha. Its estimates for full-year earnings per share were slashed by about $10 as the company saw "higher realized and anticipated care trends." UnitedHealth said it "expects to return to earnings growth in 2026." Nvidia (NVDA) placed orders with contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) for 300,000 AI-focused H20 chips as it adds to its stockpiles amid strong Chinese demand, according to a report in Reuters. Earlier this month, the Trump administration gave approval for Nvidia to resume sales of its H20 chip in China after previously issuing restrictions on the AI chip. During a trip to Beijing earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the level of orders it received would determine whether it would order more production of the chip, according to the report. Nvidia shares are higher by more than 1% in premarket trading while U.S.-listed shares of TSMC are moving slightly lower. United Parcel Service (UPS) shares are 4% lower in premarket trading after the shipping giant posted worse-than-expected quarterly profit while failing to provide a revenue or earnings outlook. UPS reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.55, lower than estimates from analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Its revenue fell 3% from year-ago levels but was above projections. UPS said it is not providing a revenue or profit forecast "given the current macro-economic uncertainty.” UPS shares entered Tuesday down about 20% this year

Major U.S. equities indexes finished Monday mixed following the weekend announcement of a trade agreement with the European Union. The new trading week promises plenty of economic and financial news, including the Federal Reserve's interest-rate announcement, the latest jobs and inflation data, and a flood of earnings reports from major companies in the tech sector and beyond. The S&P 500 eked out a gain of less than 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3%. Both indexes were at record highs. The Dow slipped 0.1%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) surged more than 10%, notching the S&P 500's top daily performance. Supermicro is set to release its quarterly results on Aug. 5. Monday's push higher for the stock followed reports that President Donald Trump has loosened restrictions on technological exports to China in a move to bolster trade negotiations with the country. Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained 4.3%. According to reports, AMD raised pricing on its Instinct MI350 AI chip, suggesting the company is confident in the capacity of its high-end product to compete with offerings from rival Nvidia (NVDA). UBS analysts boosted their price target on AMD stock, pointing to improving expectations for the semiconductor maker's upcoming earnings report, slated for Aug. 5. Nike (NKE) shares treaded 3.9% higher Monday after JPMorgan upgraded the footwear and apparel maker's stock to "overweight" from "neutral." Analysts highlighted Nike's progress on its multiyear recovery plan, which includes inventory alignment and new performance products, with particular opportunities surrounding next year's soccer World Cup in the U.S. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, suffered the heaviest decline of any S&P 500 stock, dropping nearly 11%. With the move lower on Monday, Albemarle stock gave back the gains posted over the past week and a half after reports that a large lithium miner in China had suspended operations, helping alleviate concerns about oversupply in the market for the key battery component. Albemarle and other producers have been working to cut costs as they navigate a prolonged slump in lithium prices. Revvity (RVTY) shares fell 8.3% following the medical device maker's quarterly earnings release. Although second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share topped consensus estimates, the maker of instruments and reagents for drug discovery and other healthcare research lowered its full-year profit outlook, citing expected softness in its immunodiagnostics business in China. Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded Centene (CNC) stock to "neutral" from "overweight," and shares of the health insurer slipped 5.4%. Analysts pointed to headwinds related to Centene's business in the healthcare exchange and Medicaid markets. At the beginning of July, Centene withdrew its full-year guidance, citing cost and enrollment pressure.

The mood on Wall Street feels a bit like discovering that nothing is broken after a hard fall. U.S. stocks are near record highs to start the week, reflecting optimism about a range of topics that investors have had to ponder. The European Union and the U.S. struck a deal over the weekend, easing corporate anxiety of a protracted trade war. With some of that uncertainty cleared, and earnings so far coming on strong, some analysts are sounding more upbeat than they have for a while. Oppenheimer on Monday lifted its year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 7100 from 5950, among the highest held by major Wall Street brokerage firms. The outlook—which brings its target back to where it was to start the year—implies upside of about 11% from Friday's close. Morgan Stanley said the probability of its bull case, which puts the S&P 500 at 7200 in the middle of 2026, was firming up. Numbers like those are a long way from the levels below 5000 seen in April after President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement spooked investors. The next few days will test that optimism. "Although much uncertainty and worry prevailed for some time both with trade policy and geopolitical events, and given the multitude of potential outcomes, we’d note that cooler heads prevailed — leading to positive outcomes, at least for now," Oppenheimer wrote. The Federal Open Market Committee's next decision on interest rates is due Wednesday, and Big Tech giants with a combined market capitalization of over $10 trillion are due to report earnings. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) will go on Wednesday, and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. The Fed is unlikely to surprise. The market has set about a 2% probability of a cut in the federal funds rate come July 30, according to CME FedWatch. Ed Yardeni and William Pesek of Yardeni Research believe rates will remain unchanged, they wrote Monday, though they expect Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-decision press conference to be "relatively dovish," raising the perceived odds of a September cut. (For now, they said, they're in the "none-and-done camp" for 2025.) S&P 500 companies on are track to report second-quarter year-over-year earnings growth of more than 6%, according to FactSet. The pressure is on the part of the Magnificent 7 posse reporting this week to surprise to the upside, either with their respective results or their outlooks, given how much weight they carry in the broad market index: Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia (NVDA) have accounted for almost half of the S&P 500's gain this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple has dragged. So far this reporting season, S&P 500 companies are showing "mixed results," per FactSet's John Butters. While the percentage of S&P companies surprising on the upside, 80%, is above five- and 10-year averages, the magnitude of those surprises remains below historical averages. "The capitulatory price action and EPS estimate cuts we saw in April of this year around Liberation Day represented the end of a rolling earnings recession that began in 2022," Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a note published Monday. "Now, we appear to be transitioning to a rolling recovery backdrop," he said.

Title: Will AGI Take Nvidia Stock To $300?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/28/will-agi-take-nvidia-stock-to-300/
Time Published: 2025-07-28T13:14:01Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Could Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) reach $300 in the next two years? There’s a strong possibility. How? Consider this, just about three months ago, at the end of April 2025, Nvidia stock was trading at around $95 levels and presently trades at close to $174 per share. The stock is also up roughly 4x over the past two years. Let’s look at valuations. Nvidia stock trades at about 40x consensus FY’26 earnings. Is this pricey?Not really. Especially if you consider the company's steadily expanding earnings, the long-growth runway for the artificial intelligence market, and Nvidia's formidable lead in the accelerated computing market. And if AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) becomes even partially realized over the next few years, the demand for high-performance computing could soar exponentially. In the scenario below, we use Nvidia's revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $300 stock price. More Demanding Workloads, AGI Can Drive Revenue Nvidia's revenues grew by almost 2x over the last 12 months, while posting an average annual growth rate of about 69% over the last three years, and the momentum can hold up. If Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next two years - its revenues could move from around $131 billion in FY'25 to around $334 billion by FY'27 or over 2.5x. There are several trends that could drive continued growth. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Besides this, Nvidia recently indicated that it received assurances from the Trump administration allowing it to resume sales of its H20 artificial-intelligence chip to China after facing a ban around April. This marks a significant win for the company, as it preserves access to a major and fast-growing AI market. More importantly, AI is expected to evolve from its current form - writing text, generating images - to more general intelligence. While the timeline is not certain, the goal is to get AI to reason, plan, learn new tasks without retraining. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could conduct scientific research, generate novel insights, or design entire products on its own. This could unlock breakthroughs and innovations across industries and some models suggest this could push global GDP growth from low single digits to over 20% annually. ((The Economist)) As the world moves closer to AGI, Nvidia could stands to benefit enormously. AGI systems are expected to require massive computational resources to train and run, considerably exceeding today’s models, and Nvidia’s GPUs are currently the industry standard for powering such workloads. AGI could not just be the next industrial revolution, it could be much bigger and Nvidia’s chips could be right at the heart of it. Now the stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We detail this possibility in our analysis of Nvidia Stock To Crash In 2025? Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock. Net Margins Will Remain Thick Combine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia's margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory - they grew from levels of about 25% in FY'19 to over 51% in FY'25 as the company witnessed better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia's launch of pricier higher-end products such as the latest Blackwell chips are offset by potentially higher costs and competition in the lower-end of the market from the likes of AMD. With margins remaining flat and revenue rising 2.5x, we could see earnings rise 2.5x. Looking for an alternative AI play: Could AI contender AMD see a lift ahead of earnings? Strong Results Could Mean Earnings Multiples Hold Up Now, if earnings grow 2.5x, the PE multiple will shrink by 2.5x to levels of about 16x, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting won’t happen. If earnings expand 2.5x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 40x now to about 16x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 28x looks quite likely. For perspective, Apple - a company that is growing at low single-digits - trades at 30x. This would make the growth of Nvidia’s stock by 1.7x within the next two years or so a real possibility, translating into a price of over $300 per share. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or three, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly. While Nvidia stock could have massive upside, it comes with risks and considerable volatility. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. This week is the busiest of the second-quarter earnings season, with 161 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Merck (MRK), Starbucks (SBUX), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). Four of the Magnificent 7 are also on the docket this week. According to FactSet, 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 34% of companies having already reported results. Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 6.4% year-over-year, above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 9.6%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.9%. The S&P 500 hit a new all-time high last week. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed primarily due to Tesla’s performance. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla entered the earnings season with low expectations, but it failed to impress with its report last week. Tesla was the worst-performing member of the Magnificent 7, falling 4.1% last week. Alphabet, parent of Google, was expected to report robust earnings growth and managed to exceed expectations, sending the stock 4.4% higher for the week. Alphabet’s cloud revenue soared by 31.7% year-over-year, with improving operating margins. Data suggests that their artificial intelligence (AI) search is growing, without the feared decline in monetization. Google increased its planned 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion from $75 billion, reflecting its confidence in the AI outlook, but investors are (rightly) always cautious about massive capital investments. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) after the close on Wednesday, then Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. Positive earnings surprises from the financial and communication services sector were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL) and Capital One Financial (COF) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 5.0% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. If the estimates of second-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth of 4.7% are correct, there could be limited upside to sales growth from here. Better sales results in the communication services and healthcare sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. In addition to earnings, the economic calendar is packed with crucial releases this week after a lull last week. The first look at second-quarter US economic growth comes on Wednesday. GDP growth is expected to rebound to 2.4% after a decline in the first quarter. In contrast to the first quarter, the headline GDP number is likely to overstate the economy’s strength due to fluctuations in trade related to tariffs. The Federal Reserve (Fed) rate meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, with essentially no chance of any change to rates. Instead, market participants will be looking for clues as to when the next Fed rate cut will occur. Markets are currently pricing in a 66% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the September meeting. News about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. Significant new tariffs are currently scheduled to take effect on August 1, unless an acceptable trade agreement is reached. Sectoral tariffs could also be announced. As a positive note, a trade deal framework with Japan was announced last week, providing reason for optimism about additional agreements with other nations. Also on Friday, the monthly jobs report is expected to continue showing modest but slowing growth in nonfarm payrolls. The unemployment rate is expected to reverse last month’s decline and increase to a still low 4.2%. Stocks continue to be boosted by the twin forces of better-than-expected earnings and a receding threat of recession. The betting odds of a 2025 recession fell to the lowest level of the year, while stocks reached an all-time high.

Second-quarter earnings season will kick into high gear this week. Four of the world’s largest companies—Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—are set to report their results. Artificial intelligence will be the focus for many investors, who will be hoping for updates on companies' investments in the era-defining technology and how they're using it. But trade policy could also get some airtime, especially during Apple’s and Amazon’s calls on Thursday. Microsoft and Meta kick things off with their reports and earnings calls after the closing bell on Wednesday. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) have already turned in results, so after this week the only Magnificent 7 company left to report will be Nvidia (NVDA), in late August. Here are three questions on investors' minds. Six months ago, one of the most pressing debates on Wall Street was whether U.S. tech companies were spending too much on artificial intelligence. That issue appears to be settled—or, at least, on the back burner for now. Alphabet (GOOG) last week raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast to $85 billion, citing growing demand for cloud computing products and services; that was generally read as a good thing. Google Cloud grew by more than 30% from the prior year, putting the unit on track to book over $50 billion in revenue within the next year. Cloud computing competitors Microsoft and Amazon could follow Alphabet's lead. Both companies left their capex forecasts unchanged when they reported quarterly results three months ago, decisions that may have been influenced by the trade and economic uncertainty hanging over the market at the time. The companies could be feeling more confident about boosting AI spending now that some of the fog has been lifted by trade agreements. Meta was the odd one out last quarter when it raised its capex outlook. It’s not out of the question that the social media giant will lift its forecast again; it did so in the first and second quarters last year. Investors will be looking for evidence that big investments in AI are paying off. “AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum,” said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in the company’s second-quarter earnings release. Executives said on the company’s earnings call that Google is monetizing AI search results at about the same rate as it is traditional search, and that AI overviews are driving increased search volume. In recent quarters, Meta has convinced Wall Street that AI is improving ad performance and user engagement. Investors are hoping this week’s results continue to demonstrate that Meta's investments are bearing fruit. Amazon could offer updates on how customers are engaging with Rufus, its AI shopping assistant, and Q, its work assistant. Microsoft is likely to elaborate on the uptake of its Copilot AI offering. As for Apple, experts say, investors may still have to wait for the details they crave. “We don't expect (1) an update on Apple Intelligence timing (2026), (2) any material change in quarterly capex, (3) an update on Apple Intelligence approval in China, and/or (4) any new partnership announcements,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in an earnings preview last week. Management might, however, say product sales grew faster in Apple Intelligence-enabled regions than non-AI regions, he said. At least in the near term, Apple investors are likely more concerned with tariffs than most of its Magnificent Seven counterparts. President Donald Trump in April exempted smartphones and other consumer electronics from his sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs, but the president has ordered his administration to consider invoking national security concerns to impose Section 232 duties on smartphones and semiconductors. Section 232 tariffs have held up better in court than Trump’s country-specific duties and could be harder for Apple to avoid. Even with the smartphone exemption, Apple in May estimated tariffs would add $900 million to the company’s costs in the second quarter. Investors will watch for the actual impact and to hear how Apple is engaging with suppliers and the administration to fend off tariffs and mitigate their potential impact. Trade policy will also be top of mind for Amazon investors. In the first quarter, Amazon saw some evidence buyers were stocking up to get ahead of tariffs, which could set the company up for a sequential slowdown in sales. Executives said merchants didn’t meaningfully increase prices in the first quarter, but noted that could change depending on where tariff rates end up.
