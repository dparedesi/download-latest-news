September 09, 2025 11:12 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AI Infra Summit -- NVIDIA® today announced NVIDIA Rubin CPX, a new class of GPU purpose-built for massive-context processing. This enables AI systems to handle million-token software coding and generative video with groundbreaking speed and efficiency. Rubin CPX works hand in hand with NVIDIA Vera CPUs and Rubin GPUs inside the new NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX platform. This integrated NVIDIA MGX system packs 8 exaflops of AI compute to provide 7.5x more AI performance than NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems, as well as 100TB of fast memory and 1.7 petabytes per second of memory bandwidth in a single rack. A dedicated Rubin CPX compute tray will also be offered for customers looking to reuse existing Vera Rubin 144 systems. “The Vera Rubin platform will mark another leap in the frontier of AI computing — introducing both the next-generation Rubin GPU and a new category of processors called CPX,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Just as RTX revolutionized graphics and physical AI, Rubin CPX is the first CUDA GPU purpose-built for massive-context AI, where models reason across millions of tokens of knowledge at once.” NVIDIA Rubin CPX enables the highest performance and token revenue for long-context processing — far beyond what today’s systems were designed to handle. This transforms AI coding assistants from simple code-generation tools into sophisticated systems that can comprehend and optimize large-scale software projects. To process video, AI models can take up to 1 million tokens for an hour of content, pushing the limits of traditional GPU compute. Rubin CPX integrates video decoder and encoders, as well as long-context inference processing, in a single chip for unprecedented capabilities in long-format applications such as video search and high-quality generative video. Built on the NVIDIA Rubin architecture, the Rubin CPX GPU uses a cost‑efficient, monolithic die design packed with powerful NVFP4 computing resources and is optimized to deliver extremely high performance and energy efficiency for AI inference tasks. Advancements Offered by Rubin CPX Rubin CPX delivers up to 30 petaflops of compute with NVFP4 precision for the highest performance and accuracy. It features 128GB of cost-efficient GDDR7 memory to accelerate the most demanding context-based workloads. In addition, it delivers 3x faster attention capabilities compared with NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems — boosting an AI model’s ability to process longer context sequences without a drop in speed. Rubin CPX is offered in multiple configurations, including the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX, that can be combined with the NVIDIA Quantum‑X800 InfiniBand scale-out compute fabric or the NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ Ethernet networking platform with NVIDIA Spectrum-XGS Ethernet technology and NVIDIA ConnectX®-9 SuperNICs™. Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX enables companies to monetize at an unprecedented scale, with $5 billion in token revenue for every $100 million invested. Industry Leaders Look to Rubin CPXAI innovators are exploring how Rubin CPX can accelerate their applications, ranging from large-scale software development to the analysis of dynamic visual content to better understand moving images. Cursor, an AI-powered software company that offers an advanced code editor, sees the benefits of Rubin CPX to boost developer productivity with intelligent code generation and collaborative tools directly in the coding environment. “With NVIDIA Rubin CPX, Cursor will be able to deliver lightning-fast code generation and developer insights, transforming software creation,” said Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor. “This will unlock new levels of productivity and empower users to ship ideas once out of reach.” Runway, an American generative AI company, will use NVIDIA technologies to enable creators to produce cinematic content and sophisticated visual effects with unmatched scale and efficiency. “Video generation is rapidly advancing toward longer context and more flexible, agent-driven creative workflows,” said Cristóbal Valenzuela, CEO of Runway. “We see Rubin CPX as a major leap in performance, supporting these demanding workloads to build more general, intelligent creative tools. This means creators — from independent artists to major studios — can gain unprecedented speed, realism and control in their work.” Magic is an AI research and product company developing foundation models to power AI agents that can automate software engineering. “With a 100-million-token context window, our models can see a codebase, years of interaction history, documentation and libraries in context without fine-tuning,” said Eric Steinberger, CEO of Magic. “This enables users to coach the agent at test time through conversation and access to their environments, bringing us closer to autonomous agentic experiences. Using a GPU like NVIDIA Rubin CPX greatly accelerates our compute workloads.” Software SupportNVIDIA Rubin CPX will be supported by the complete NVIDIA AI stack — from accelerated infrastructure to enterprise‑ready software. The NVIDIA Dynamo platform efficiently scales AI inference, dramatically boosting throughput while cutting response times and model serving costs. The processors will be able to run the latest in the NVIDIA Nemotron™ family of multimodal models that provide state-of-the-art reasoning for enterprise-ready AI agents. For production-grade AI, Nemotron models can be delivered with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a software platform that includes NVIDIA NIM™ microservices as well as AI frameworks, libraries and tools that enterprises can deploy on NVIDIA-accelerated clouds, data centers and workstations. Built on decades of innovation, the Rubin platform extends NVIDIA’s developer ecosystem — with NVIDIA CUDA‑X™ libraries, a community of over 6 million developers and nearly 6,000 CUDA applications. AvailabilityNVIDIA Rubin CPX is expected to be available at the end of 2026.

Title: Watch These Nebius Price Levels as Stock Surges on AI Deal With Microsoft

Nebius Group shares jumped Tuesday after the Amsterdam-based AI infrastructure provider said it has inked an agreement with Microsoft worth up to $19.4 billion over five years. Under the deal, Nebius (NBIS) will deliver computing resources to Microsoft (MSFT) later this year using a data center in New Jersey, helping the Azure owner address a demand shortage for cloud infrastructure that can process increasing AI workloads. CEO Arkady Volozh said it’s the first time Nebius had signed a long-term contract with a large tech company, and added that there are likely more to come. Nebius stock was up 37% at $88 in recent trading after hitting an all-time high near $98 in the opening minutes of the session. The stock has more than tripled since the start of 2025, boosted in part by news AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA) had taken a stake in the company. Below we analyze the technicals on the Nebius chart and identify major price levels worth watching out for after the stock’s big move today. After climbing to their highest level in more than three years last month, Nebius shares had consolidated in a pennant, a chart pattern that signals a bullish continuation upon a breakout to the upside. That move higher took place on Tuesday, setting the stage for potential follow-through buying. Interestingly, prior to today’s surge, the relative strength index bottomed around its neutral reading, the same level that coincided with the end of a dip in early July. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast a potential bullish price target to monitor and also point out major support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can forecast a bullish price target by using the measured move technique, a study that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements. When applying the analysis to the Nebius chart, we measure the percentage change of the steep uptrend from May to August that preceded the pennant and add it to the pattern’s top trendline value, assuming a similar continuation move may play out in the months ahead. For example, we apply a 145% increase to $72, which projects a target of $176.40—implying that the stock could more than double from Monday’s closing price. During retracements, investors should initially watch the $87 level. The stock could be snapped up at this level by investors looking for entry points on a retest of the prominent November 2021 peak, which also marks the stock’s prior all-time high. A close below this level could see the shares fall to support near $76. This area may provide support around the top of the pennant, which also corresponds with a period of trading activity on the chart between September and October 2021. Finally, a more-significant drop in Nebius shares could bring lower support at $54 into play. Investors may seek buying opportunities at this location near the February 2022 countertrend peak and a range of sideways price action on the chart that preceded a notable stock gap last month.

Shares of Nebius Group (NBIS) soared 50% in early trading Tuesday after the artificial intelligence infrastructure company struck a deal with Microsoft (MSFT) that could be valued as much as $19.4 billion. Microsoft agreed to pay the Nvidia-backed (NVDA) firm, which completed its split from Russian internet giant Yandex last year, $17.4 billion over five years to provide artificial intelligence infrastructure for a new data center in New Jersey. Microsoft “may also acquire additional services and/or capacity” for another $2 billion under the agreement. Founder and CEO Arkady Volozh said this was the first of what Nebius expects will be “significant long-term committed contracts with leading AI labs and big tech companies.” With Tuesday's surge, Nebius shares have more than tripled in value since the start of the year. Microsoft shares were up less than 1% in recent trading and have added close to 20% year-to-date.

Stock futures are slightly higher after the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit a new all-time-high; Nebius Group (NBIS) shares are soaring after the company inked an AI infrastructure deal with Microsoft (MSFT); Lachlan Murdoch gains control of the media empire that includes Fox (FOX) and News Corp (NWS); Oracle (ORCL) is expected to report revenue growth when it delivers quarterly earnings after the closing bell; Teck Resources (TECK) and Anglo American announce merger to form copper mining giant; and Apple launches its iPhone 17. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are slightly higher this morning after the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite hit a new record high on Monday, as stocks rallied amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon. The benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average come into today's session just below all-time highs of their own. Bitcoin (BTCUSD), which has been under pressure in recent weeks, is up slightly at $112,500. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is ticking higher after hitting its lowest level since April yesterday, while gold and oil futures are also edging upwards in early trading. (Read Investopedia's real-time markets coverage here.) Nebius Group (NBIS) shares are up more than 50% in premarket trading after the AI infrastructure company announced a multi-year deal with Microsoft (MSFT). Amsterdam-based Nebius will provide Microsoft with dedicated capacity at its new data center in Vineland, New Jersey starting later this year, the company said. CNBC reported the deal was worth $19.4 billion. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) owns a stake in Nebius. “The deal will also help us to accelerate the growth of our AI cloud business even further in 2026 and beyond,” said Nebius CEO Arkady Volozh. Microsoft and Nvidia shares inched higher in premarket trading. A deal has been reached to end the yearslong fight over control of the media empire founded by Rupert Murdoch that includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Lachlan Murdoch, who is the CEO of Fox (FOX) and chair of News Corp (NWS), will take control of the trust that holds sizable stakes in both of his father’s companies. As part of the deal, Rupert Murdoch’s children Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch and James Murdoch will end their claim to the company. Shares of Fox and News Corp were each down nearly 5% in recent premarket trading. Investors are awaiting quarterly results from Oracle (ORCL), which are scheduled to be released after markets close today. The cloud computing giant is expected to post a 13% year-over-year jump in quarterly revenue to $15 billion, according to analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase to $1.48. The report comes after Oracle shares hit an all-time-high earlier this year on the announcement of $30 billion in new cloud deals. The stock, which has gained more than 40% since the start of 2025, was up about 1% in premarket trading. Mining firms Teck Resources (TECK) and Anglo American have agreed to merge to form a new global minerals company that will be one of the world’s largest producers of copper. The new company, to be called Anglo Teck, will have a combined market capitalization of more than $53 billion. “Anglo Teck will hold an industry-leading portfolio of producing operations, including six world-class copper assets, alongside high-quality premium iron ore and zinc businesses,” Teck said in a release. Shares of Canada-based Teck Resources were up about 17% in premarket trading, while U.K.-based Anglo American gained about 8% in London trading.

Title: Job Growth Sputters: Rate Cuts And Recession Incoming?

Time Published: 2025-09-07T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Worse-than-expected job growth on Friday sent the S&P 500 lower after reaching a closing high on Thursday. Employment grew by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. The household survey data were solid, with a gain of 288,000 jobs following a decline of 260,000 jobs the previous month. The household survey research series, which aligns with the payroll report criteria, increased by 781,000. The significant increase in the research series is merely little more than a slight reversal of the 753,000 decline from the previous month. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2%. This increase in unemployment was mainly due to relatively positive reasons, with job gains of 288,000 in the household survey and an increase of 436,000 in the labor force. The underemployment rate is a broader measure of unemployment, which includes “unemployed people, plus everyone marginally attached to the workforce, plus all people employed part-time for economic reasons.” The underemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points above the December 2022 low, while the unemployment rate has risen 0.9 percentage points from its low. The underemployment rate can serve as a leading indicator of unemployment, reflecting the growing slack in the labor market. Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.9% last month. The average workweek hours held steady at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, which was depressed by weather and the LA fires. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio has been teetering around the current level, but the labor market has remained resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far and improved fractionally this month. Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. The Sahm Rule states that a recession begins when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months. The three-month average of the US unemployment rate is 4.23%, well below the 4.51% Sahm Rule trigger. The Sahm Rule has had an unblemished historical record of predicting recessions. However, its perfection is in jeopardy since the rule was triggered in July and September 2024 with no economic contraction yet in sight. Another useful predictor of recessions has been earnings growth, as a recession is typically associated with a year-over-year decline in corporate profits. For this analysis, the NIPA corporate profits are used rather than S&P 500 earnings. NIPA data includes all US companies, including both public and private entities, as well as small companies and S corporations. For the second quarter of 2025, NIPA profits grew by 4.3% year-over-year, which remains positive but looks to be decelerating. Notably, S&P 500 earnings grew at a 12% year-over-year pace; however, much of that rapid growth was driven by technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Therefore, NIPA provides a better window into the overall economy. Following the weaker jobs data, markets expect three 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025. The softer labor market has made a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting a virtual certainty. Bottom line: Following the shockingly large downward revision last month, this month’s jobs report makes it clear that the labor market has been softening and is teetering on the edge. These facts will not escape the Fed’s notice, so a September rate cut is now a fait accompli following the release of the monthly payrolls report last week. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high during the week but declined fractionally on Friday following the release of the jobs report. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to a favorable legal outcome for Alphabet and enthusiasm about Elon Musk’s ambitious Tesla performance targets. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Though the recession odds rose intra-week, the betting odds held steady week-over-week. There are only four companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, but Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) are certainly notable. Producer (PPI) and consumer inflation (CPI) rates for August are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday respectively. While a higher-than-expected PPI report would garner attention, the CPI will be more critical, as the extent to which price increases, including those from tariffs, reach consumers is the crucial variable. CPI is expected to rise year-over-year to 2.9% from 2.7%. The consensus forecast is consistent with the estimates from the Cleveland Fed, so this result is unlikely to hinder the September rate cut. A hot set of inflation reports would likely decrease the number of rate cuts expected in 2025, rather than endangering the September move. Despite the slight decline on Friday, stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession and forecasting that the Fed will begin rate cuts soon enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. The bond market is less sure of the Fed’s success, with corporate bond spreads widening to levels last seen during the build-up to the tariff worries earlier in the year. While conditions should be monitored closely, there is currently little evidence of an impending recession. However, as noted, some storm clouds are on the horizon that could shift the economy in that direction.

Title: Volatility Is Back, And This 7.8% CEF Is Here To Get Us Through It

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. A market on a precipice. That’s the vibe around stocks right now, and I’m guessing you’ve felt it, too. On the one hand, the S&P 500 is up 14% in the past year, a very solid performance (and for the record, I see more gains ahead). Yet volatility has returned, and it feels like we could be on the verge of another selloff. So what do we do right now? We’re going to look at a closed-end fund (CEF) that profits from short-term volatility. In fact, this one harnesses the energy that choppy markets throw off and “converts” it to a hefty dividend stream. The result? This CEF takes the low-yielding (mainly) tech stocks in the NASDAQ 100 (average yield: 0.5%) and bumps that up to a solid 7.8% dividend. But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. Before we go further, let me touch on why I feel that, over the long term, more gains are ahead for US stocks. For one, the value of long-term bonds has dropped, showing that investors still have a healthy appetite for risk, selling, as they are, some of the safest investments out there. Stocks (particularly tech stocks) are the obvious destination for these investors. At the same time, the stock market is backed up by the US economy’s continued strong growth. What’s important is what’s going on after the effects of inflation. In real terms, US GDP growth in 2025 has been around 2% on a year-over-year basis. It’s a solid clip that’s topped expectations, with many economists predicting less than 1% growth. Then there’s the most current economic estimate we have, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow indicator, which shows growth accelerating, spiking to over 3% in the third quarter. What’s behind this expansion? AI, for one: Investments in the tech will hit $400 billion this year, up 60% from 2024—and they’re still growing fast. It’s clear that AI, whatever we may think about it, is a boon to the economy, and the momentum is not letting up. Of course, in the short term, investors will fret, which is why any downturns are buying opportunities. But what can we do now, with stocks having tempered their recent gains and before we see the next significant drop? This is where that CEF I mentioned earlier comes in: It sells call options, or the right for buyers to purchase its holdings at a fixed price and a fixed date in the future. It then uses that cash to fuel its 7.8% payout. It’s a nice dividend play while we wait for the next selloff to put stocks—and the “pure” equity-focused CEFs I prefer for the long run—back on sale. Tech stocks are perfect for covered-call selling because they’re sensitive to the kinds of panic selloffs we’re likely to see as AI optimism ebbs and flows, with an ebbing of sentiment seemingly around the corner. (For the record, though, in the long run, I see Big Tech’s AI investments as likely to be worth it—the productivity gains the technology offers are just too great.) The go-to covered-call fund here is the Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). Since it owns the NASDAQ 100, its portfolio is a who’s-who of companies driving the AI boom. NVIDIA (NVDA) is its biggest holding, at nearly 10% of the portfolio, followed by Microsoft (MSFT). The NASDAQ is up 90% over the last three years, while the S&P 500 is up just 63%, showing how much money there is to be made in investing in tech over the long term. But as you’ve no doubt noticed, the NASDAQ’s volatility is always higher, and can spike in times of panic, like what we saw during the April “tariff tantrum.” In short: Buying the NASDAQ is great, but you need nerves of steel while you hold it. That’s where QQQX comes in, “translating” that volatility into a regular quarterly dividend that gives investors that 7.8% income stream. That by itself is why QQQX is a strong candidate when market jitters push up volatility. But there’s another: QQQX is especially cheap now. Over the last decade, QQQX has had an average discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of 1.7%. It’s now 7.7%, and it was even lower in the last few months, averaging about 10% throughout 2024 and the first few months of this year. Why is it a bit narrower now? Because investors are realizing that QQQX’s investments continue to appreciate, as does its ability to boost dividends. Those strengths should help its discount to move toward par, where it traded in the 2010s. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Tesla Floats a Trillion-Dollar Pay Plan for CEO Elon Musk

Trillions are the new billions. Electric-vehicle company Tesla (TSLA) on Friday unveiled a proposed compensation package for Elon Musk that could grow to roughly $1 trillion if the CEO hits performance targets and collects all of the shares awarded. Between the new plan and shares he owns now, the estimated value of Musk's implied total stake in Tesla would exceed $2 trillion, cementing his status as the world's wealthiest human. Musk has to hit what the company called "Mars-shot milestones"—longer than a moonshot, to be sure—to be compensated in full, according to a company filing. In addition to market-cap milestones attached to the plan's share-award tranches, the company would have to meet operational milestones that start with product delivery targets and end with adjusted Ebitda hurdles. The first pair of milestones requires Tesla's market capitalization to reach and sustain $2 trillion and the company to deliver a cumulative total of 20 million vehicles. Market-cap targets jump by $500 billion with every tranche, with the last target being $8.5 trillion—more than double the current market cap of Nvidia (NVDA), the most valuable company in the world. Operational milestones include 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation as well as logging $400 billion in adjusted Ebitda over four consecutive quarters. The last two of the 12 tranche awards would only be granted after Musk sets a succession plan approved by Tesla. And he would have to stay at the company for at least 7 1/2 years. The plan, on which shareholders are scheduled to vote Nov. 6, could stir up drama if shareholder reactions are anything like receptions to past pay packages. In 2018, a group of Tesla investors balked when shareholders approved a 10-year performance-based pay plan that would award Musk a then-estimated $56 billion. A Delaware judge struck down the deal twice, and Tesla's board recently approved an interim stock award of 96 million shares of restricted stock. If Musk is awarded the original 2018 package, the interim award would be forfeited. In order for Musk to own his earned awards outlined in the 2025 pay package, he has to pay the equivalent of Tesla's closing price on Sept. 3, or roughly $334 per share in cash or stock, after he hits the 7 1/2-year mark, at the earliest, or after 10 years. During negotiations that stretched across 10 meetings, Musk threatened to "pursue his other interests" and leave Tesla if he wasn't assured he'd be compensated for his past services as outlined under the 2018 pay package and at least a 25% voting interest, according to the proxy filing, up from about 20% now. "The Committee believes the cost to Tesla and its shareholders is well worth it in light of the tremendous value that would be created, and strides in product development that would be realized, if the 2025 CEO Performance Award is fully achieved," Tesla's filing said. For now, investors appear pleased. Tesla shares rose almost 3% as of Friday afternoon to a recent $348.

Shares in Broadcom, which last night posted fiscal third-quarter results that topped estimates Thursday on record revenue, are soaring 15% in early trading Friday, lifted by the results and the OpenAI news. Speculation about a big new customer the company disclosed last night without identifying it also helped the stock. The Financial Times, citing "people familiar with the matter," said that OpenAI was the customer that committed to $10 billion in orders Broadcom CEO Hock Tan referred to during last night's conference call. Citi analysts in a note also said they believe OpenAI was that customer. Broadcom and OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI will initially use the new chip for its own internal purposes, the FT reported, with shipments beginning next year, according to the FT and Bloomberg. OpenAI, which currently uses chips from Nvidia, is following the path of other big tech firms like Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) in moving to create AI chips in-house. Broadcom's quarterly results are the latest to show sustained demand for AI hardware following earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) last week, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) last month. The company's shares have gained more than 50% so far this year. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.
