Thoughtful woman at the hair salon looking beautiful with her new look BlackRock is making changes to some of its highest-yielding funds. Today we’re going to zero in on a 13%-yielder that’s at the center of the action: the tech-focused BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ). Yes, the fund focused on tech. So the pullback in American AI stocks on news that Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek, which was launched earlier this month, can rival the latest version of Open AI’s ChatGPT, factors in here, too. BIGZ is a closed-end fund (CEF) with nearly $2 billion in assets under management—enormous for a CEF (The “BIG” is right in the ticker, after all). So any changes to BIGZ are worth watching, especially when, as is the case now, those changes (including a big share-buyback program) are partly a response to activist action, both around the fund’s sponsor, BlackRock, and the CEF industry as a whole. Let’s dive into exactly what’s going on here. The best place to start, actually, is with BlackRock’s other two big tech CEFs, the 8.2%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), another 13% yielder. Unlike BIGZ, these funds aren’t changing, for reasons that should be clear in a bit. These funds’ portfolios overlap, but they’ve recently taken different paths. BSTZ, for its part, has been focusing more on private tech firms, as well as fast-growing public companies. NVIDIA (NVDA), its largest holding, and Astera Labs (ALAB), are examples of the latter. Both are at the heart of AI’s continued growth. Even with the DeepSeek news on Monday, and the pressure it put on American AI stocks, these two have still posted strong gains, up 31% and 34%, respectively, since Astera’s IPO in March 2024. However, as the developments around DeepSeek showed us, there’s still a lot of uncertainty around AI. That’s why BSTZ’s sister fund, BST, bolsters its NVIDIA position with mature tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN), all top-10 holdings. As a result, BST has been less volatile in the past year, on the basis of the performance of both its underlying portfolio (a.k.a. its net asset value, or NAV), and its market price (both including dividends). (Since CEFs have fixed share counts, there is often a difference between the market price and NAV returns, with the market price often discounted). But BSTZ (in purple below) put up a stronger market price–based total return as investors got aggressive about tech after the 2022 rout. Total Returns This, by the way, is exactly why we hold this duo—to get tech exposure and use BST’s large cap focus to temper our volatility. That’s worked well, with BST and BSTZ delivering us a 24% average return between them in the last year, well above the S&P 500’s 16% return, with a big slice of that in cash, thanks to their 10.5% average yield. So where does BIGZ fit in here? It has some investments in private firms, similar to BSTZ and, to a lesser extent, BST. But the key difference is that BIGZ has major holdings a little outside tech, with military contractor Axon Enterprise (AXON), data-center servicer Vertiv Holdings (VRT) and plumbing/HVAC specialist Comfort Systems USA (FIX) being its biggest positions. As you can see, the focus here is on small firms that are growing fast. This should mean fast returns for BIGZ—but that’s not what we’ve seen. Check its performance based on the latest numbers for its total NAV return (or, again, the return of its underlying portfolio, including dividends). BIGZ Lags As you can see, it was much weaker than those of the other two CEFs. This lag was unacceptable, as activists reminded BlackRock, which responded by shaking up BIGZ in several ways. For one, BIGZ will get a new management team and a new mandate tightening its focus on tech. You can read more about those changes here. BlackRock is also bringing in a buyback program under which shareholders can tender shares of BIGZ for 99.5% of the fund’s NAV per share. The company is offering this for half of the total number of shares outstanding, and the stop and start dates haven’t been announced yet. That’s a massive program that should help support BIGZ’s market price. With a 9.1% discount to NAV, investors can buy BIGZ at 90.9 cents on the dollar and sell at 99.5 cents on the dollar, a 9.5% gain separate from BIGZ’s market performance. The risk here is that, if BIGZ’s NAV drops before an investor can redeem their shares, they might end up redeeming them for less. But in that case, they could simply ignore the redemption and keep collecting BIGZ’s 13% dividend—provided the fund’s new management keeps earning enough profits to maintain that payout.

Title: “Made In America” Is Easier Said Than Done
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/31/made-in-america-is-easier-said-than-done/
Time Published: 2025-02-01T00:08:46Z

Bringing manufacturing back to the United States, colloquially known as nearshoring, is poised to significantly reshape trucking and rail networks across North America. The push for localized supply chains promises shorter delivery times and reduced geopolitical risks, but it also brings challenges in infrastructure and logistics. The companies solving these challenges are going to be critically important and could be an investment opportunity. Nearshoring offers two big advantages and a few smaller challenges. First, it can help companies avoid tariffs and FX headaches. Second, it can shorten lead times and improve inventory management. Trump’s original push for tariffs and COVID-19’s supply chain shock have made a strong business case for bringing manufacturing back to the United States. The cost of manufacturing domestically is higher than manufacturing abroad. However, having confidence that your supply chain can deliver and not having to deal with political spats carries significant value. Unfortunately, the higher costs associated with manufacturing domestically generally need to be passed on to the consumer. Higher prices for some goods are tolerable, but if it’s broad-based then it can be inflationary. An additional challenge is that the United States currently faces some constraints on manufacturing. Labor is one – we addressed it last month here – and transportation is another. Put simply, we need our domestic logistics to level up to accommodate a push for more manufacturing at home. Aerial view of cars at the Volkswagen plant in Puebla, Mexico, on August 4, 2018. - Mexican ... [+] President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's advisers on August 27, 2018 hailed a new trade deal with the United States, saying it represented progress on energy and wages for Mexico's workers. (Photo by Jose Castanares / AFP) (Photo credit should read JOSE CASTANARES/AFP via Getty Images) Mexico has become America’s largest trade partner, recently overtaking China as the top exporter to the United States. It is well positioned geographically and broadly has lower wage costs and a greater supply of labor for factory-level jobs than the United States. US companies have invested significant capital in Mexico over the past several decades and many companies send parts back and forth from the US to Mexico for different parts of the manufacturing process. Canada’s geographic proximity has also made them a critical trade partner for the U.S., but mainly in the realm of natural resources. Crude oil, liquefied natural gas, lumber, and other mined commodities consistently supply US markets. North American trade has become increasingly interwoven and has accelerated as scrutiny on China has mounted. According to the Brookings Institution, the U.S. imported $472.5 billion of goods and services from Mexico while Canada imported $15.6 billion worth of goods. The United States also accounts for over 40% of Mexico’s imports. This partnership is bidirectional and has led to gains for both the United States and Mexico. Generally speaking, Mexican manufacturing shouldn’t be seen as a direct competitor to American manufacturing but rather as a complement. Mexican factories use parts imported from the U.S. and vice versa; corporations have allocated capital across both countries to drive manufacturing efficiencies and try to remain competitive with low-cost goods from China. While investing in Mexico means navigating complicated labor laws and exposure to cartel crime, the low-cost labor makes it a necessary input for effective North American manufacturing. The degree to which companies can nearshore and access cheap labor in Mexico is important because it impacts the mix of goods that can be effectively manufactured outside of China. High-value goods like electronics and automotive components can be manufactured and sold domestically with cheaper labor in Mexico and capitally intensive factories in the United States combining to offer a competitive product. Potential shifts in US import policy, specifically with regards to tariffs on Mexico and Canada could jeopardize this balance. The ability to manufacture efficiently in the United States could actually take a hit if we make trade with Mexico and Canada more difficult. Consequently, while we are broadly optimistic on North American manufacturing, we’d shy away from trying to pick winners or losers who might be impacted by tariffs or trade disputes. Instead, we would suggest focusing on investment opportunities in companies who facilitate trade and transport unfinished components and final goods to their points of sale. The economy is strong, and nearshoring has momentum, the space is probably worth a look. 370225 03: Tractor-trailer rigs are parked at the Petro truck stop May 29, 2000in El Paso, TX. Many ... [+] of the rigs now have modern wireless communications as well as cable television, refrigerators, double bunk beds, and microwave ovens. In the last few years trucks have become more like a home/office on the road. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Newsmakers) The value of U.S. freight by truck with Canada and Mexico has steadily increased since the mid-2000’s and amounts to over $70 billion as of December 2023, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. With nearshoring comes shorter supply chains, and an increase in the need for valuable truck space, meaning trucking fleets need to navigate the shifting trade landscape to accommodate retailers’ just-in-time inventory approach. With trucking, the two general approaches to shipments are full truckload (FTL) and less-than-truckload (LTL) – the latter meaning a single truck carries shipments from multiple customers and the former meaning all goods in the container are destined for the same location for the same customer. Generally, LTL shipments are more expensive on a per-unit basis but offer manufacturers greater flexibility in getting finished goods to retail customers or storage warehouses. Instead of committing and paying up for larger shipments that take up entire truckloads, companies can have goods shipped with smaller, more frequent LTL runs which allow for quick inventory adjustments. These quicker adjustments are helpful during labor strikes or supply chain disruptions. LTL shipments account for just about 10-15% of the industry’s volume today, but the rise in e-commerce and necessary shorter transit times presents a compelling investment opportunity for trucking firms down the road. Companies like FedEx Corp. (FDX) and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. (ODFL), who specialize in LTL shipping, dominate the market and offer solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises that don’t have the scale to fill up whole truck beds with raw materials or finished products. Conversely, the FTL industry is highly fragmented and relies heavily on brokerage firms to match shippers with small and mid-size carriers. Trucking is also incredibly fragmented. According to RXO Inc (RXO), the top 15 FTL carriers combine for less than 10% of total market share. More than 95% of carriers operate 10 trucks or less! Although still critically important for the food, pharmaceutical, and consumer goods industries, it’s a heavily diluted market with minimal barriers to entry. Artificial intelligence and technological innovation is coming for the trucking industry. Something as simple as improving routing could lead to significant cost savings. Technology enabling real-time tracking of vehicles, predictive maintenance, and dynamic route adjustments based on traffic or weather conditions could all lead to bottom line improvements. Better routes and more well-maintained trucks reduce fuel consumption, repairs, and idle/empty drive times. Firms with enough capital to own trucking fleets and invest in technology like XPO Logistics (XPO) can integrate trucking fleets with warehouse management systems to streamline order processing and reduce downtime. Technology can also help tackle regulatory complexity. Importing goods from Mexican maquiladoras, factories that import materials and export the finished goods, requires expertise in customs and border clearance. Facilitating the clearance of goods through U.S. customs and navigating documentation, duties, and inspections means third-party logistics firms like C.H. Robinson (CHRW) with integrated customs brokerage services are crucial for nearshoring to succeed. Finally, the United States is facing an acute shortage of truckers, especially those who are interested in long haul journeys. The adoption of automated driving for semi-trucks would be huge for the industry. Regional routes often involve repetitive patterns and well-defined paths, making them ideal candidates for early implementation of autonomous driving systems. These systems can handle highway driving and reduce driver fatigue, while allowing human operators to focus on more complex urban or last-mile navigation. Currently, according to the American Journal of Transportation, the U.S. has a shortage of more than 80,000 truck drivers, a deficit expected to by 2030. This is compounded by the composition of trucking labor force - the average age of truck drivers exceeds the median labor force age in the U.S. Companies focusing on autonomous driving are therefore going to be crucial if nearshoring momentum is going to keep picking up. Companies like Aurora Innovation (AUR) have teamed up with technology giants like Nvidia (NVDA) to mass produce its integrated driverless systems. Furthermore, companies like Tesla have been working on Semitruck technologies for years. LIVINGSTON, MONTANA – APRIL 5: Boeing 737Next generation fuselages manufactured by Spirt AeroSystems ...

(Photo by William Campbell/Corbis via Getty Images) There is no one-size-fits-all approach to tackling the logistics of nearshoring, and trucking is not the only solution. Intermodal transportation, the integration of tracking and rail, is set to grow substantially as trucking routes shrink and the just-in-time approach to inventory management continues to permeate American manufacturing. Intermodal transportation isn’t a novel idea, but the relationship between the two transportation methods will have to deepen to accommodate nearshoring and the current demographics of the trucking labor force. Intermodal transportation relies heavily on strategic partnerships between railroads and trucking companies to optimize the process of getting FTL shipments onto rail cars and shipped across North America. All of the big players in FTL trucking are attached to the hip with Class I railroads like BNSF Railway, Union Pacific (UP)and Norfolk Southern (NSC), so the ability to leverage scale and in-house logistics is of utmost importance. Rail hasn’t seen the same levels of growth as trucking over the last 20 years but is still well-suited for transporting large volumes of goods over long distances, making it a cost-effective option for long transports. Although the actual volume of rail freight is less than that of trucking, rail networks are essential to shortening trucking routes and reducing congestion on highways. Investments in rail infrastructure, including expanded rail yards, upgraded tracks, and digitization of intermodal facilities are all going to be essential in the years to come. However, investing in infrastructure is expensive and scale brings advantages in safety standards and cost efficiency. We wouldn’t be surprised to see M&A activity in the space pick up as nearshoring continues. Even if there’s no M&A, we still expect the space to have significant funding needs. Any build out of intermodal transportation networks is going to be capital intensive. Electrification, new tracks, and new freight cars all have significant up front costs with long pay back periods. Specialized lenders and private credit shops will have opportunities to engage in asset-backed lending with long pay back periods. Nearshoring is poised to uplift the significance of both rail and trucking industries. As manufacturing moves closer to home, the demand for efficient, localized logistics will only grow, requiring substantial innovation and capital. The integration of rail and trucking through intermodal transportation will be critical to maintaining the speed and flexibility needed for just-in-time delivery systems. Meanwhile, the trucking sector will see increased demand for trucking and third-party logistics as businesses continue to seek more agile, responsive supply chains. Technological advancements will also play a pivotal role in reducing operational costs for shippers. For investors, this evolving landscape presents opportunities in the picks and shovels needed for transporting goods from point A to point B. As nearshoring continues to gain momentum, the future of U.S. freight transportation will be defined by innovation, collaboration, and a renewed focus on North American trade, and is worth keeping a close eye on.

The capital will be used to expand ElevenLabs’ capabilities and make its A.I. voices more “expressive and controllable,” the company said. “Speech is how we naturally communicate. This funding moves us closer to a world where digital interactions happen by voice—fluid, natural and as effortless as a conversation,” said Staniszewski, who serves as CEO of ElevenLabs, in a statement. ElevenLabs’ products include tools that build interactive voice agents, generate custom voices or sound effects via text prompts and help voice actors monetize A.I.-generated audio. According to the company, its technology has been embraced by workers at more than 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies. Customers range from peer A.I. companies like Perplexity AI, which uses ElevenLabs to generate podcasts summarizing the news, to publishers like The Washington Post and The Atlantic, which utilize the technology to create audio versions of stories. Last year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams tapped the startup to contact New Yorkers with multilingual robocalls. The rise of A.I.-generated voices hasn’t been without controversy. Last year, audio experts claimed that technology from ElevenLabs was used to generate robocalls mimicking the voice of former President Joe Biden to voters in New Hampshire during the Presidential campaign. ElevenLabs subsequently suspended the account behind the fake robocalls. The company said its latest funding will be used to bolster A.I. safety and ensure its products are deployed without harm. To date, ElevenLabs has raised $281 million in venture funding. Its top backers include Sequoia Capital, Smash Capital, Broadlight Capital, SV Angel, NFDG and Salesforce’s venture arm. The A.I. voice industry generated $3.5 billion in revenue in 2023. That figure is expected to exceed $21 billion by the end of the decade, according to data from Grand View Research.

Title: Five market signals flashing red amid DeepSeek sell-off

LONDON (Reuters) - In a week when AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) suffered the biggest one-day loss of value on record and the Federal Reserve said it was in no hurry to cut rates again, a few gauges underscore markets' vulnerability to big swings. Investors and analysts said the sell-off in tech stocks this week, driven by the popularity of China's DeepSeek AI model, highlights the market ructions that can occur when heavy speculation meets unexpected bad news. Here are five signals that highlight some of the tensions simmering. Despite Monday's ructions investors remain bullish about U.S. tech and President Donald Trump's plans for tax cuts and deregulation, heightening risks of market gyrations if this widespread consensus proves wrong. Short-term speculators have in recent months taken on more debt to magnify their gains, with levels of so-called gross leverage among hedge funds that trade U.S. stocks hitting their highest since 2010 in January, Morgan Stanley data showed. Citi's equity positioning model, derived from futures contracts, shows traders are heavily betting on further gains for Wall Street's tech-focused Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). "Everyone is sort of piled in. They're super optimistic," GAM chief multi-asset strategist Julian Howard said. These trends are making some long-term money managers nervous, with JPMorgan attributing part of Nvidia's violent Jan. 27 drop to traditional asset managers selling out. Kevin Thozet, investment committee member at Carmignac, said he had reduced exposure to U.S. tech stocks several days ago and added to positions that would profit if the Nasdaq fell, saying DeepSeek called U.S. tech-stock "exceptionalism" into question. High-for-longer U.S. interest rates, he added, might prompt U.S. households, now heavily invested in stocks, to pull money out. Analysis by the U.S. Office of Financial Research has also found strong correlations between retail investment in speculative assets, such as crypto-currencies and use of consumer credit, signaling last year's rate cuts fueled market gains. The highest bond yields in years could also dent stocks' appeal as investors can now get returns of 4% or more on government debt. One measure of the equity risk premium - the extra return investors can expect for stocks - dropped below zero in December for the first time since the aftermath of the dot-com bubble in 2002. "When people talk about managing volatility amidst all this, one of the areas which does it really well is short-dated fixed income," said GAM's Howard. Since the Nov. 5 U.S. election, traders have doubled the size of their bets that the dollar (DX=F) will rise. They now hold net short positions - a bet on the value of something falling - in all other major currencies. This has only happened on rare occasions in the last 10 years, LSEG data shows. Much of this positioning is predicated on the Fed cutting rates more slowly than elsewhere, and an assumption that tariffs and tax cuts spark higher inflation and government borrowing, meaning any change to that scenario could be problematic for the U.S. currency. High concentration in tech stocks has made portfolios vulnerable, analysts say, and a rush to alternatives, such as Japan's yen (JPY=X) and European credit, is another sign of fast-changing market dynamics. As European shares have hit record highs, Bank of America data showed money has flowed into European credit funds for 23 consecutive weeks. The VIX (^VIX), which measures how volatile traders expect the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to become, is below its long-run average of about 20. But it has spiked out of nowhere twice in the last six months, once in August when a surge in the yen wreaked global havoc and again in December when the Fed hinted it would slow the pace of rate cuts. Rob Almeida, global investment strategist and portfolio Manager at MFS International, described markets as "fragile" and said Monday's heavy stock selling may have been driven by "leverage that might be being unwound and isn't being accounted for".

Investing in stocks and earning money from dividends is a proven way to build wealth in the long run, but choosing the right companies to invest in can make or break people’s financial dreams. Many investors have achieved amazing financial goals by carefully researching companies, understanding their financial situation and analyzing their growth and income potential. The key is to look for quality businesses with strong foundations, stable earnings and a proven history of paying dividends to their shareholders. When investors pick the right stocks, they benefit from price appreciation and dividends, which, when reinvested, can create a snowball effect that speeds up portfolio growth. Don't Miss: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100. CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast — here’s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate. For example, many investors choose companies like Microsoft and FactSet Research Systems because they consistently offer value through growth, dividends and innovation. These two companies are among the top picks of investors who have built a $900K stock portfolio in only seven years. The poster, who runs a private business, shared in a Reddit community that he started investing from scratch seven years ago. He built his portfolio by studying the companies in the market, understanding their financials and picking stocks aligned with his goals. While he now hits $2,500 monthly in dividends, his next goal is $5,000. “So excited: second big goal complete! Next milestone is $5,000,” he wrote. His ultimate objective is to generate $12,000 in monthly dividends, which will allow him to live comfortably with his family. His current portfolio includes some of the most well-known stocks in the market, so let’s break down each stock and see why they’re part of his strategy.

Title: The Dow jumps 250 points on strong tech earnings. Apple is up next

The Dow and other major indices edged higher following earnings reports from tech giants Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). However, AI stock Nvidia (NVDA) dropped another 2%, continuing its decline after it was hit hard by the launch of DeepSeek’s efficient-yet-thrifty AI model. By the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained about 240 points, or 0.54%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose by 0.18% and 0.53%, respectively. Meanwhile, the latest report on U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showed the economy grew at a 2.3% annualized, inflation-adjusted rate in the fourth quarter. This was slightly below economists’ expectations of a 2.5% increase. Investors are also awaiting earnings reports from Apple (AAPL), set to be released after the closing bell, along with financial updates from payment giants Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V). Tesla (TSLA) shares rose despite fourth-quarter revenue and other metrics falling short of Wall Street expectations. The Austin, Texas-based electric vehicle maker reported fourth-quarter revenue of $25.7 billion, up 2% compared to last year’s $25.2 billion. But analysts had expected $27.2 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Automotive revenue fell by 8% during the September to December quarter to $19.8 billion, but it still accounted for the vast majority of Tesla’s income. Sales grew year-over-year but failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations and push Tesla over the finish line to reach its goal of 1.8 million units sold, which would have matched 2023's deliveries. —William Gavin contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia stock has crossed a red line that points to more pain after this week's DeepSeek rout
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-stock-price-outlook-technical-analysis-deepseek-ai-moving-average-2025-1

Nvidia stock is on thin ice as it trades below a key technical level for the first time since January 2023. Shares of the graphics processing unit maker have plunged 16% since investors descended into a panic earlier this week over a new AI model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. The drop, which erased nearly $600 billion in Nvidia's market value in a single day, sent the stock to its 200-day moving average. That threshold is a closely watched technical indicator that helps identify the long-term direction of a trend. When securities fall below their 200-day moving average, it warns traders that the prior uptrend in a stock price could be on the verge of reversing course. Nvidia stock closed below its 200-day moving average on Monday, jumped back above it on Tuesday and Wednesday, but then fell back below it during Thursday's trading session. The stock traded at $119.70 on Thursday, below its 200-day moving average of $122.28. The back-and-forth trading above and below the key threshold suggests that Nvidia is trading at make-or-break levels this week. Will Tamplin, a senior analyst at Fairlead Strategies, said the downside price action in Nvidia was a warning of more pain ahead. "NVDA is seeing a hard test of its rising 200-day MA, near $122. We think the correction is likely to deepen further toward secondary support at roughly $110," Tamplin told Business Insider in an email. Tamplin said momentum in Nvidia stock is to the downside in the intermediate term, defined as two to four months, adding that the stock had yet to hit oversold territory, which suggests more downside ahead. "From a long-term perspective, momentum has fallen off since mid-2024, meaning that the primary uptrend is likely to become shallower or turn into a trading range environment for 2025," Tamplin wrote. David Keller, the chief strategist at Sierra Alpha Research, told BI that the breakdown in Nvidia was significant considering that the stock had been in a trading range since early November. Keller said it's a concerning sign that there had been no immediate "buy the dip" activity in Nvidia stock since Monday's sharp decline. "Instead of an influx of buyers pushing NVDA back into the consolidation range, we've instead seen the price remain generally within the range of Monday's action," Keller wrote. "Until and unless NVDA can regain the $130 level, we would consider this chart guilty until proven innocent." Ari Wald, the head of technical analysis research at Oppenheimer & Co., said Nvidia stock was unlikely to enter an immediate downtrend, nor likely to resume its two-year uptrend. Instead, Wald told BI that the stock should enter a sideways consolidation phase going forward. "Typically, reversals out of a strong uptrend transition into a range rather than a downtrend meaning continued oscillations around the stock's flattening 200-day average would be reasonable over the coming weeks to months," Wald said via email. Wald is watching $140 as a resistance level for the stock, as well as $100 for a level of support. While he ultimately expects Nvidia to resume its uptrend in the long term "based on what we see as middle-innings, growth-led, secular advance," Wald said, it makes sense for investors to wait for the uptrend to come back before buying the stock. "A sidelines approach makes sense while the stock works off prior excesses through the balance of the current cycle," Wald said. And while Nvidia's decline this week has been significant, it's masking underlying strength in the broader market, Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist at Carson Group, said. "The bar is set quite high and these names need to report strong earnings to justify the current valuation," Detrick told BI, referring to Nvidia and some other chip-related stocks. "But at the end of the day, rotation is the lifeblood of a bull market and to see rotation out of chips and into things like transports and financials" might not be "the worst thing," he added. Nvidia will get a chance to prove to investors that it's worthy of its premium valuation when it reports earnings after the market close on February 26. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures stepped higher on Thursday, eyeing a comeback as investors digested earnings from a trio of megacap techs and waited for Apple (AAPL) results for more clues to the prospects for Big Tech. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) moved up 0.3%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were little changed, in the wake of a losing day on Wall Street. After the Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates as expected, investors have turned to parsing earnings reports — and in particular, the first wave of results from the "Magnificent Seven" companies that have driven broader stock market gains. Markets appeared to be keeping faith with Big Tech following results from Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) late Wednesday. Eyes were on their rationale for massive AI investments after DeepSeek's cheaper AI model rattled assumptions about the likelihood of a payoff. Tesla shares popped despite an earnings miss as investors took on trust its vow to return to growth in 2025. Meanwhile, Meta's quarterly earnings beat helped lift shares in pre-market, but Microsoft stock slid after its cloud revenue fell short. Next up is Apple (AAPL), whose stock has been hit by multiple downgrades. Investors will scrutinize its quarterly report after the bell for signs its iPhone sales are doing better than feared. Chipmaker Intel (INTC), Comcast (CMCSA), Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) are also on the docket. On the economic front, a first look at fourth quarter GDP is due later, expected to show a slowing to 2.6%. An update on weekly jobless claims also lies ahead, while Friday's PCE inflation report is the highlight of the week. Meanwhile, a fatal collision between an American Airlines (AAL) passenger jet and a US army helicopter dominated headlines. The crash happened in midair as the plane approached Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday night. Tesla's (TSLA) quarter wasn't great. Margins missed estimates. Sales came in light. And Elon Musk was back to his antics on the earnings call of conveying guidance that by his own admission is "insane." Investors now have a choice to make on Tesla. Do you avoid the stock because it's a disruptive EV company that may underwhelm in the near-term as it invests in its business and Elon could fall out of favor with President Trump? Or, do you buy the stock because the company will likely have driver-less cars on the road in 2026 alongside humanoid robots in factories. I don't have the answer for you. But I think RBC analyst Tom Narayan makes a host of good points on how his clients are viewing the stock: "Moonshots getting real. Tesla announced that it will have a paid unsupervised full-self driving (FSD) service in Austin this June. We expect this to be an end- to-end fleet service similar to Waymo (except will use a Tesla vehicle). We expect the car to have pedals and steering wheels and not be a cybercab. The release announced Tesla will have unsupervised FSD for its own customers as well as the robotaxi business in parts of this year. Management also indicated that there is interest from a number of major car companies to license FSD technology but would only entertain orders if volumes are high. Regarding supervised FSD, the company says it is working to launch in Europe and China this year. Regarding Optimus, Tesla now thinks it will make several thousand this year and will utilize some at company facilities. Next year once it produces version 2, it can do 10K per month as opposed to 1K per month." Levi's (LEVI) was having a relatively good earnings call last night. Considering how challenging retail was for the holidays (if your name isn't Walmart (WMT)), to see organic sales for the Levi's brand up 8.2% is win for that team. But Levi's 2025 EPS guidance of $1.20 to $1.25 was a country mile away from consensus for $1.38 a share. While the blame is going to foreign exchange fluctuations, I think there is a large chunk that reflects what's happening at department stores. Macy' (M)s continues to shut a ton of stores and it's not alone in doing so post holidays. If these stores are closing, Levi's loses places to sell its wares. Management has often told me they are doing big business in there own stores and online. But the unwinding of the department store space is a structural problem. More on that here in my chat at the World Economic Forum with Ralph Lauren's (RL) CEO Patrice Louvet. The Fed may have stood pat on rates Wednesday, but Goldman Sachs still sees a world where rate cuts happen in 2025. Said Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius in a new note: "In light of today’s message, we remain comfortable with our standing forecast that the FOMC will deliver two more 25bp cuts in June and December this year and one more in 2026. Over the course of the next few FOMC meetings, we expect year-on-year core PCE inflation to fall meaningfully and in a way that “builds [the] confidence” that Powell said he wanted to see." Nvidia (NVDA) isn't having a good week. The combination of the surprising DeepSeek news and fears of the Trump administration further cracking down on chip flow has the stock down 13% on the week. Interestingly, that hasn't stopped the Nvidia bulls from buying the dip. New data out of Vanda Research shows individual investors bought $562.2 million of Nvidia shares on Monday's rout. Self-directed traders bought $359.7 million of the stock on Tuesday. I certainly appreciate everyone racing to read Meta's (META) cash flow statement to see how much it's spending on capital expenditures, mostly related to AI infrastructure build outs. But the reality is all that matters to the Meta investment thesis — for now — is that the company is taking its new AI and applying it to sucking in more ad dollars. Meta remains an advertising led business full stop. To that end, important point on this by Mark Zuckerberg on the earnings call last night: "This year, the improvements of the business are going to be taking the AI methods and applying them to advertising and recommendations and feeds and things like that. So, the actual business opportunity for Meta AI and AI studio and business agents and people interacting with these AIs remains outside of 2025 for the most part," Zuckerberg said. Said Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak, "In the end we see a strong revenue growth outlook from increased usage/new products/better targeting/higher prices." Sounds right to me. I was going to say something more uplifting on Microsoft’s (MSFT) results, which at first glance don’t warrant the pre-market sell-off. AI services sales surged 157%, supporting the yearslong narrative on the stock. But the Street has a point that Azure growth was under-whelming and may not reaccelerate in the back half of the year. “The issue was in Azure where management attributed new sales execution issues on non-AI services which saw underwhelming consumption in fiscal second quarter and a weaker outlook, where a second half re-acceleration is more uncertain. The results are indeed a setback to the second half Azure acceleration thesis,” Citi analyst Tyler Radke said. Then Microsoft slipped this into its earnings call that I don’t think is getting the attention it deserves: “And while we expect to be AI capacity-constrained in Q3, by the end of FY'25, we should be roughly in line with near-term demand given our significant capital investments,” said Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. To me, it signals a potential slowing in the AI story in the back half of the year. So not much up-lifting to say here after all. Stock probably warrants the spanking.

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Reports 33% QoQ EPS Growth in Q3 2024, Driven by Exceptional Profitability and AI Innovation

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs’ 35 AI Superstars. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. In September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures. Although the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements—especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation. While dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. However, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector. Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market’s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. There are various reasons why this company makes an excellent investment. For instance, the report for the third quarter of year 2024 reflects the company's exceptional growth in profitability. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.93, increasing 33% from the previous quarter and a 765% increase from a year ago. Additionally, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.16, increasing 28% from the previous quarter and 486% rise from the previous year. Moreover, the NVIDIA Cosmos platform plans to advance physical AI with new models and video data processing pipelines for robots, autonomous vehicles and vision AI. Lastly, the company aims to revolutionize graphics with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, the most powerful GeForce RTX GPU so far, with 92 billion transistors and delivering 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS). Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas claims to buy more Nvidia shares amid rout on DeepSeek rise, netizens say, ‘good move’

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas bought more Nvidia shares amid the market sell-off following the rise of the Chinese AI app DeepSeek. In a post on the social media platform X, Srinivas said, “I just bought some more NVDA(sic).” Perplexity CEO made this claim while responding to a post on X, where Jim Cramer, a journalist from CNBC raised concerns over Nvidia shares. “There is no silver lining right now with Nvidia though,” Cramer wrote. The United States tech stocks and global stock markets were severely impacted by the low-cost Chinese AI app DeepSeek on Monday, tanking the value of leading chip maker Nvidia by $593 billion, a 17 per cent crash. January 27 marked a record one-day market-cap loss for the Wall Street stock in history, according to LSEG data. DeepSeek hit the Nvidia stocks the hardest, impacting others as well. On January 27, the US tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3.1 per cent, mainly due to Nvidia's crash, which lost a record 17 per cent overnight, followed by chip maker Broadcom Inc, which went down 17.4 per cent, ChatGPT backer Microsoft down nearly 2.1 per cent, and Google's parent company Alphabet dipped 4.2 per cent, according to a Reuters report. DeepSeek's latest large language models have challenged the dominance of top AI companies by offering similar performance to Meta or OpenAI with reportedly a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek's free app has also taken over ChatGPT on Apple's App Store in several regions, including the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, and Singapore, impacting tech stocks. Several social media users have reacted to the X post of Srinivas with most of them appreciating his move. One of the users wrote, “You are the silver lining.” “Good move,” added another. “I never believe what my TV says about stocks. I believe myself. And I believe NVDA will go up again. I hold and not selling. Americans need NVDA and don’t care what China does,” another user said. “I mean, that's fair. if there's no silver lining, might as well buy the dip,” one of the users commented. “To the moon,” added another.

DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence startup that sent tech stocks reeling this week, sparked fresh concerns about U.S. companies losing their competitive edge in the global race for AI dominance. While DeepSeek claims to have built its R1 model with less than $6 million and limited computing power, some industry analysts say this development poses little threat to America’s AI leadership, with one even suggesting the technology might backfire against Chinese authorities as unwieldy AI could fuel information freedom and social dissent. The Chinese company’s approach, though efficient, comes as U.S. firms push ahead with more ambitious projects and infrastructure investments. “If DeepSeek is as important as all of the papers say it is — and I think that there’s good reason to believe all of this — it makes OpenAI’s projects all the more valuable and all the more feasible in a shorter time period,” Will Rinehart, a senior technology researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. He also called the Chinese startup “the most important firm in AI right now” in his Monday article. deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. — Sam Altman (@sama) January 28, 2025 DeepSeek’s new R1 model, he explained, reduces both the financial barriers to AI development and reliance on advanced semiconductors — a key focus of the CHIPS Act. The model achieves comparable performance with significantly fewer parameters, requiring less computational power while maintaining output quality. DeepSeek’s app has already cruised to the top spot on Apple’s App Store ranking, easily surpassing U.S. competitors like ChatGPT and Claude. The startup’s meteoric rise fueled investor doubts about Nvidia — whose hardware has long been considered essential for scaling advanced language models — and triggered a nearly 17% drop in the company’s stock by Monday’s market close. Silicon Valley titan Marc Andreessen even hailed the model as “AI’s Sputnik moment” — but there’s reason to doubt that DeepSeek’s R1 represents another instance of a communist power beating the U.S. to a major technological milestone. Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment. — Marc Andreessen 🇺🇸 (@pmarca) January 26, 2025 Rinehart commended DeepSeek for pioneering high-quality AI at minimal cost compared to high-budget U.S. firms, but he doesn’t believe the Chinese startup’s success necessarily spells the downfall of U.S. firms like OpenAI. He explained that, because of its open-source structure, DeepSeek’s R1 offers OpenAI a kind of “playbook” with which it can learn to streamline its own models — opening the door for a symbiotic relationship between the two firms. “What that means is, everyone else can look and see this white paper … and if you know what you’re looking at, you’re like, ‘OK, that’s what they’re doing.’ And so then you can basically avoid research dead ends and generally know which direction for the research to pursue,” Rinehart continued. “But as soon as that happens, that means that other relatively frontier labs can do the same thing.” The “white paper” Rinehart referenced is a document articulating a new language model feature and its applications for AI industry professionals, rather than consumers. Although Rinehart believes that classifying software as simply “open-source” or “closed-source” is overly simplistic for today’s language models, they are still somewhat useful designations: an open-source model like DeepSeek’s is traditionally understood as software that is publicly available for anyone to use, modify or share, which promotes collaboration. A closed-source model like OpenAI’s is understood as one whose code is kept proprietary, limiting access to its underlying systems to authorized employees. He also dismissed the notion that DeepSeek’s model is cost-efficient enough to eliminate OpenAI’s need for Stargate — the president’s $100 billion AI data center infrastructure initiative spearheaded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son — to develop its “next-generation” of data centers to supply computing power for a much higher “projected usage” than currently demanded of DeepSeek.

He announced one of the most major, important investments in data centers ever. And I think that’s still a win,” he added. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) represents a key goal for the AI industry: an artificial intelligence system capable of matching or exceeding human-level performance across all cognitive or intellectual tasks — though AGI’s precise definition remains a subject of technical and philosophical debate. Dan Schneider, a policy expert and vice president at the Media Research Center, a nonprofit watchdog group, seemed unfazed by the stock market’s reaction to the DeepSeek release in an interview with the DCNF. Nvidia, a longtime favorite among investors, lost nearly $600 billion in market value Monday, the largest single-day decline for any U.S. company in history. “Nvidia’s stock prices had been soaring when people thought that it was a critical incumbent,” Schneider said. “OK, well, this is what happens in a free market system, where a new competitor enters the field and the incumbents then lose value. Wall Street should be optimistic about the value being created for all other businesses and people around the world. Whether you’re in agribusiness, or you’re in banking or you’re making widgets — AI is going to help create more value. This is going to be a great boon to the whole world economy.” Schneider seemed similarly unconcerned about the Chinese company’s growing competitive edge against U.S. firms, arguing that DeepSeek poses less threat to American interests than to the Chinese Communist Party itself. He predicted the technology would eventually spark social upheaval in China, citing his belief that open-source “AI has a real opportunity to end all types of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes” through the free exchange of information.

I really believe that AI is going to be key to defeating all sorts of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes,” Schneider said, also acknowledging the Chinese Communist Party will likely “use any kind of technology at its disposal to create weapons” for “nefarious purposes.” The Stargate Project has already begun preliminary construction for its first data center campus in Texas, according to OpenAI.

Title: Nvidia Praises DeepSeek’s Breakthrough Despite Losing $500B in Market Cap Because of It

Earlier this week, an obscure Chinese A.I. startup named DeepSeek shook Silicon Valley after it claimed that it had built a highly capable A.I. model called R1 for a fraction of the cost of its American rivals like OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s Gemini. Major A.I. stocks plummeted in response to the report. Nvidia (NVDA), which makes expensive chips (GPUs) that power the development of such A.I. models, saw its shares slide more than 16 percent on Monday (Jan. 27), erasing nearly $500 billion in its market cap.

You can opt out anytime. Despite the negative financial impact, Nvidia praised DeepSeek’s breakthrough. “DeepSeek is an excellent A.I. advancement and a perfect example of test time scaling,” a company spokesperson told Observer in a statement. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” Test-time scaling is a new real-time prediction technique that adjusts an A.I. model’s computational requirements based on the complexity of a task during real-time use. Before that, there were two dominant approaches to scaling an A.I. model: pre-training and post-training. Pre-training scaling expands an A.I. model’s dataset and computing power during initial training while post-training scaling helps fine-tune the model and enhance its real-world performance. According to its research paper, DeepSeek’s R1 model was trained on 2,048 Nvidia H800 chips for a total cost of under $6 million. Some companies and A.I. insiders are skeptical about this claim. For example, Alexandr Wang, the founder and CEO of Scale AI, suspects that DeepSeek may have more Nvidia chips than it’s letting on. Despite leveraging scaling laws, A.I. models often demand significant GPU power during output generation. To counter this, Deepseek said it developed R1 as a “distilled A.I.” model—a smaller model trained to replicate the behavior of larger A.I. systems. Distilled models consume less computational power and memory and offer greater accuracy in tasks such as reasoning and coding, making them an efficient solution for resource-constrained devices such as smartphones. Microsoft and OpenAI are currently investigating whether DeepSeek stole OpenAI’s proprietary data through GPT APIs using “distillation” techniques to build R1’s architecture. “It’s important to note that the $6 million figure for R1 doesn’t account for the prior resources invested,” Itamar Friedman, the former director of machine vision at Alibaba, told Observer. “DeepSeek’s relatively low training cost figure likely represents just the final training step.” Friedman explained that while scaling and optimization are valuable, there are limits to how small an A.I. model or training process can be while still effectively simulating thinking and learning. “Large, high-cost systems will still have a major advantage,” he said. DeepSeek, headquartered in Hangzhou, was founded in 2023 as a spinoff from the hedge fund High-Flyer, led by Liang Wenfeng. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Fundstrat chief investment officer Tom Lee says the market sell-off triggered by the release of low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) model DeepSeek is an overreaction. In a new interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell,” Lee says that Monday’s market correction is likely an opportunity for long-term investors. Stocks and crypto plummeted on Monday as investors processed DeepSeek’s implications, including for AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), one of the hardest hit stocks. “Markets don’t like uncertainty. They like visibility. They like moats. So markets are a little scared [Monday]. To me, it’s an overreaction. The Nvidia decline is the worst since March 2020, and we know that that ended up being a huge opportunity for investors. It’s not a fun day, but I’d be looking at this as an opportunity… This is the nature of technology. I’d be personally surprised if Nvidia became Betamax in the past week. I mean that really would be the kind of change that would be required to really justify selling Nvidia here. Given the need for AI because of global labor shortage and Nvidia chip dominance is still strong, unless a new model emerges that doesn’t require GPUs (graphics processing units) entirely, I’d say that markets just generally do buyer-ready aim.” Lee also says that he is bullish on the financial sector overall in 2025. “Financials, to me, represent a pretty good fundamental case of change this year, because we have a new administration, a Fed that is dovish, yields that aren’t painful for banks, and at a time when it could lead to upside for capital markets activity and multiples are low. So I think financials remain our number one S&P sector idea.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

The Nasdaq and other major indices declined following the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year, with the tech-heavy index falling 1.1% by the afternoon as investors digested the central bank’s cautious stance on interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee kept the overnight borrowing rate unchanged in the 4.25% to 4.50% range and signaled continued caution about potential rate cuts, with recent economic indicators showing mixed signals. “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” the FOMC said in a statement. “The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level, and labor market conditions remain solid.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 dropped by 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. Nvidia (NVDA), a key player in the AI sector, continued to decline, falling by 6% Wednesday following a massive selloff triggered by DeepSeek. Other AI stocks, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), also saw losses. Investors are now closely monitoring the earnings reports from Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), which are due after the market’s close. Shares of coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX) jumped over 8% following its earning reports. The Starbucks ceramic mug hype is real – so much so that CEO Brian Niccol mentioned it three times during the company’s Jan. 28 earnings call. The return of the coffeehouse classic is part of Niccol’s broader “Back to Starbucks” strategy, which aims to reestablish the company as a premium coffee brand. This move comes as the company grapples with a slight sales decline, though it exceeded Wall Street’s revenue expectations. “We reintroduced ceramic mugs and handwritten notes on cups to better connect with customers and elevate the cafe experience for those who choose to stay and work,” Niccol said during the earnings call. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT+7.03%) (DJT) shares surged over 7% Wednesday after announcing plans to expand into financial services, including potential investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The company, majority-owned by President Donald Trump, unveiled a new fintech brand, Truth.Fi, which will launch with up to $250 million. These funds, custodied with brokerage firm Charles Schwab (SCHW-0.23%), will be allocated across customized exchange-traded funds, cryptocurrencies, and other investment vehicles. — Francisco Velasquez contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.9% in the afternoon session after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is considering curbing sales of the company's chips to China following the emergence of the DeepSeek AI model. According to the sources, the restriction might apply to some of Nvidia's cutting-edge chips, including the H20 AI chips. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Nvidia’s shares are very volatile and have had 26 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 13% on the news that stocks heavily tied to the AI market took a hit after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek released a new large language model (DeepSeek-R1) that ranks competitively on key global benchmarks (coding competitions, math evaluations), uses less advanced semiconductor chips, costs significantly less to build (at $5.5 million - excluding non-compute costs), and has already achieved strong adoption after topping the iPhone App Store for AI apps. Notably, the company has also open-sourced this model, a move that may make it harder for rivals to justify huge upfront expenditures on hardware, software, and expertise to develop similar systems. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek's efforts, calling the new model "super impressive" for its open-source design, efficient inference-time computing, and high compute efficiency. "We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously," he added. Nadella's comments suggest that upstarts like DeepSeek could reshape the competitive landscape of AI. DeepSeek's announcement disrupts long-held assumptions in key ways: 1) It undercuts the narrative that bigger budgets and access to top-tier chips are the only ways forward for AI development. 2) By using less advanced hardware, DeepSeek opens the door for innovators who face high chip costs or export restrictions, reaffirming they can still compete. 3.) The model's success questions the growth narrative of chipmakers like Nvidia—whose soaring valuations depend on the demand for cutting-edge, high-performance hardware. Overall, DeepSeek's model demonstrates that AI innovation is no longer a race fueled solely by how much you spend, but rather by how resourceful you can be with what you have. Nvidia is down 12.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $121.52 per share, it is trading 18.7% below its 52-week high of $149.43 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $19,796. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares tumbled nearly 6% in intraday trading Wednesday, dashing hopes for a quick recovery from losses earlier in the week amid concerns about competitiveness of American AI firms and their spending on the emerging technology. The AI chipmaker's stock led losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and was among the top decliners on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Wednesday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), Palantir (PLTR), and several other AI darlings over the past year also were lower. The surging popularity of an app from Chinese startup DeepSeek, which runs on an AI model it claimed can perform on par with American rivals at a fraction of the cost, had sent Nvidia and a slew of other U.S. tech stocks into a tailspin Monday. Despite a brief rebound in Tuesday's session, the tech sector fell back into the red Wednesday as Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) rolled out a new AI model it says can outperform models from DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms (META). The rapid rise of lower-cost models from Chinese companies that can compete with those from leading American firms has spurred a reckoning on Wall Street, with earnings from Meta and Microsoft (MSFT) likely to be in the spotlight later tonight as both firms face pressure to prove their AI investments can yield results that justify the costs. Analysts have so far remained mostly bullish on their prospects, with Morgan Stanley analysts telling clients that advances by DeekSeek could prove "positive" for Microsoft and Meta, suggesting Meta could implement them and that Microsoft's Azure platform would benefit from a proliferation of AI models and consumer applications. Bank of America analysts told clients in a note Wednesday they see this as "AI's Sputnik moment," suggesting competition could push U.S. hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to spend even more on AI, to the benefit of Nvidia, Broadcom, and other AI chipmakers. They reiterated a "buy" rating and $190 price target for Nvidia's stock, adding they "view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) will report its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, its first such announcement since the company ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger over frustrations with his enormous turnaround effort. Intel is currently being led by co-CEOs David Zinsner, who also serves as CFO, and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, who is also CEO of Intel Products. The company is still searching for a permanent CEO to take the reins and attempt to revitalize the storied chipmaker. Intel stock is down a staggering 54% over the last 12 months and reported the largest quarterly loss in its history last quarter. Intel isn’t the only chipmaker hurting, though. Rival AMD (AMD) is down 36% throughout the last year. Nvidia (NVDA), however, continues to gain steam, rising 93% in the last year, despite suffering a massive rout on Monday on the back of worries related to China’s DeepSeek AI. Intel’s still-nascent foundry business, which both produces chips for Intel and is designed to act as a contract manufacturer for third parties, continues to be a drag on its overall revenue despite announcing agreements to build chips for Amazon’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft (MSFT). Intel is expected to report earnings per share of $0.12 on revenue of $13.8 billion in the quarter, according to Bloomberg consensus data. That’s a drop from the $0.54 per share and $15.4 billion in revenue the company reported in Q4 last year. Intel’s Client Computing business, which includes chips for PCs, is set to top out at $7.8 billion, down from $8.8 billion last year, while its data center business is expected to reach $3.3 billion, down from $3.9 billion last year. The Intel Foundry business is expected to hit $4.5 billion, up from $291 million in Q4 2023. Intel is working to build out new facilities to research and construct chips across the US, but the company is dealing with a relatively flat PC market despite promises that AI PCs would help buoy the space in 2024. According to IDC, PC shipments rose just 1% in 2024, and there’s still plenty of uncertainty about 2025. “The overall macroeconomic concerns seem to be overshadowing some of the progress and excitement around AI PCs,” Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC's Worldwide Device Trackers, said in a statement. “However, we maintain the view that the impact that on-device AI will have on the industry will be positive, even if the inflection point is delayed.” The company’s data center business is also struggling to catch up to the likes of Nvidia. While Intel is working to develop its own AI chips, it’s still far behind market leaders, and there’s no clear understanding as to if and when it could catch up.

Title: Should You Buy Nvidia Stock in the Wake of the DeepSeek Bombshell? Here's What Wall Street Is Saying.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/29/2025 9:43:48 AM PST by SeekAndFind Technology stocks were rocked to their core Monday after claims made by a Chinese start-up threatened to upend the existing artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm.There’s a compelling argument that recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) could have vast implications for the future. Over the past couple of years, advances in generative AI have helped fuel a roaring bull market with promises of significant productivity increases. The potential windfall of increased profits has companies racing to adopt these next-generation algorithms.One of the biggest beneficiaries of these secular tailwinds has been Nvidia (NVDA 8.93%). The company’s graphic processing units (GPUs), which were initially developed for gaming applications, proved equally adept at supplying the computational horsepower needed for AI. Robust sales of these processors fueled a parabolic rise, sending Nvidia stock up more than 500% over the past two years.However, claims made by Chinese start-up DeepSeek threatened to upset the existing paradigm, sending Nvidia into a tailspin. The stock slumped 17% and lost nearly $600 billion in market cap in a single day. Nevertheless, after a good night’s sleep, Wall Street has some thoughts on the matter.Perspective is requiredEdgar Allan Poe famously wrote, “Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see.” Wall Street seems to be taking that approach, to a certain extent, regarding some of the assertions made by DeepSeek. Specifically, claims that it created its chatbot for $5.6 million are being met with skepticism by some analysts.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients (emphasis mine), “Did DeepSeek really ‘build OpenAI for $5M?’ Of course not.” The analyst suggested that many of the routine expenses and development costs were left out of the total. “DeepSeek’s R1 paper did not quantify the additional resources that were required to develop the R1 model (presumably they were substantial as well),” he wrote.Many investors panicked on Monday, fearing that more efficient AI models would mean less business for Nvidia, but that’s likely not the case. According to Jevons paradox, efficiency gains from technological advancements generally increase demand by bringing costs down. Put another way, lower-cost AI models will drive increased adoption, which will increase demand for Nvidia’s AI-centric processors.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse took a similar position: “Innovation is driving down cost of adoption and making AI ubiquitous,” he wrote. “We see this progress as positive in the need for more and more compute over time (not less).” This bodes well for Nvidia.Tigress Financial upgraded Nvidia to strong buy on Tuesday and increased its price target on the stock to a Street-high $220. That represents potential upside for investors of 71% compared to Tuesday’s closing price. The analyst believes that the data center growth needed to support AI will continue unabated and Nvidia — which controls a dominant share of the data center GPU market — will continue to profit from this trend.Even in the wake of the DeepSeek bombshell, Wall Street is almost universally behind Nvidia. Of the 63 analysts who have offered an opinion thus far in January, 94% rate it a buy or strong buy, and none recommend selling.This shows that Wall Street remains remarkably bullish on Nvidia despite DeepSeek’s seemingly earthshaking developments.The Motley Fool’s OpinionOn Jan. 27, a roundtable discussion among Fool analysts took place, and they debated the issues surrounding DeepSeek’s announcement. From that conversation, several highlights stand out:The panelists echoed the question of whether it cost just $5.6 million to train DeepSeek’s chatbot. A review of the white paper supplied by DeepSeek seems to suggest that this only includes the cost for the most recent version and none of the development that preceded it.The DeepSeek AI assistant recently became the No.1 downloaded free app on the Apple Store. However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the number of downloads and the actual app usage, which could call into question the veracity of these statistics.Those caveats aside, there’s the potential that this is the natural evolution of the technology. As resources become more scarce, the focus will inevitably turn toward innovation, breeding the next generation of advancements.Even if this represents a breakthrough in AI development, it likely won’t reduce the need for Nvidia’s state-of-the-art processors, as they will continue to play a crucial role in training AI models.The group generally agreed that Nvidia’s premium valuation would lead to increased volatility, which would test the mettle of investors.Collectively, the evidence suggests that DeepSeek’s bombshell was more of an inevitable evolution of technology than a major breakthrough.It’s still the early days of the AI revolution, and as such, investors should expect more “bombshell” developments in the field in the months and years to come. Some investors were scared out of Nvidia on Monday, but having a knee-jerk reaction to news like this could be a costly mistake.Data by YChartsFinally, Nvidia stock is currently selling for roughly 50 times earnings. While that might be enough to send value investors headed for the exits, that’s far below Nvidia’s average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 81 over the past five years, making it relatively inexpensive from a historical perspective. Furthermore, the stock gained more than 2,000% during that same period, which illustrates why it is worthy of a premium.Given the company’s long track record and history of innovation, I still believe Nvidia is a worthwhile investment. There’s a compelling argument that recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) could have vast implications for the future. Over the past couple of years, advances in generative AI have helped fuel a roaring bull market with promises of significant productivity increases. The potential windfall of increased profits has companies racing to adopt these next-generation algorithms.One of the biggest beneficiaries of these secular tailwinds has been Nvidia (NVDA 8.93%). The company’s graphic processing units (GPUs), which were initially developed for gaming applications, proved equally adept at supplying the computational horsepower needed for AI. Robust sales of these processors fueled a parabolic rise, sending Nvidia stock up more than 500% over the past two years.However, claims made by Chinese start-up DeepSeek threatened to upset the existing paradigm, sending Nvidia into a tailspin. The stock slumped 17% and lost nearly $600 billion in market cap in a single day. Nevertheless, after a good night’s sleep, Wall Street has some thoughts on the matter.Perspective is requiredEdgar Allan Poe famously wrote, “Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see.” Wall Street seems to be taking that approach, to a certain extent, regarding some of the assertions made by DeepSeek. Specifically, claims that it created its chatbot for $5.6 million are being met with skepticism by some analysts.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients (emphasis mine), “Did DeepSeek really ‘build OpenAI for $5M?’ Of course not.” The analyst suggested that many of the routine expenses and development costs were left out of the total. “DeepSeek’s R1 paper did not quantify the additional resources that were required to develop the R1 model (presumably they were substantial as well),” he wrote.Many investors panicked on Monday, fearing that more efficient AI models would mean less business for Nvidia, but that’s likely not the case. According to Jevons paradox, efficiency gains from technological advancements generally increase demand by bringing costs down. Put another way, lower-cost AI models will drive increased adoption, which will increase demand for Nvidia’s AI-centric processors.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse took a similar position: “Innovation is driving down cost of adoption and making AI ubiquitous,” he wrote. “We see this progress as positive in the need for more and more compute over time (not less).” This bodes well for Nvidia.Tigress Financial upgraded Nvidia to strong buy on Tuesday and increased its price target on the stock to a Street-high $220. That represents potential upside for investors of 71% compared to Tuesday’s closing price. The analyst believes that the data center growth needed to support AI will continue unabated and Nvidia — which controls a dominant share of the data center GPU market — will continue to profit from this trend.Even in the wake of the DeepSeek bombshell, Wall Street is almost universally behind Nvidia. Of the 63 analysts who have offered an opinion thus far in January, 94% rate it a buy or strong buy, and none recommend selling.This shows that Wall Street remains remarkably bullish on Nvidia despite DeepSeek’s seemingly earthshaking developments.The Motley Fool’s OpinionOn Jan. 27, a roundtable discussion among Fool analysts took place, and they debated the issues surrounding DeepSeek’s announcement. From that conversation, several highlights stand out:The panelists echoed the question of whether it cost just $5.6 million to train DeepSeek’s chatbot. A review of the white paper supplied by DeepSeek seems to suggest that this only includes the cost for the most recent version and none of the development that preceded it.The DeepSeek AI assistant recently became the No.1 downloaded free app on the Apple Store. However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the number of downloads and the actual app usage, which could call into question the veracity of these statistics.Those caveats aside, there’s the potential that this is the natural evolution of the technology. As resources become more scarce, the focus will inevitably turn toward innovation, breeding the next generation of advancements.Even if this represents a breakthrough in AI development, it likely won’t reduce the need for Nvidia’s state-of-the-art processors, as they will continue to play a crucial role in training AI models.The group generally agreed that Nvidia’s premium valuation would lead to increased volatility, which would test the mettle of investors.Collectively, the evidence suggests that DeepSeek’s bombshell was more of an inevitable evolution of technology than a major breakthrough.It’s still the early days of the AI revolution, and as such, investors should expect more “bombshell” developments in the field in the months and years to come. Some investors were scared out of Nvidia on Monday, but having a knee-jerk reaction to news like this could be a costly mistake.Data by YChartsFinally, Nvidia stock is currently selling for roughly 50 times earnings.

Given Deep Six is based on pirated nvidia chips…… MSN Money: “There is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases, and that is Nvidia,” said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. Bernstein has reiterated its outperform ratings on Nvidia, with a $175 price target, and Broadcom, with a $220 target, saying it continues to like those names within the U.S. semiconductor sector.” CCP: Chinese Communist Party actually means Cut, Copy, Paste. My personal take... After the initial shake-out, more voices calling for temperance rose to the surface. While it is entirely possible that a more efficient model could lead to weakening demand for Nvidia’s chips, it is far from a guarantee. In fact, it could have the opposite effect: It could lead to increased demand. There is a concept in economics dubbed the Jevons Paradox that may apply here — that is, increased efficiency in a market leads to more demand, not less. If DeepSeek’s model leads to AI models in general taking a leap forward in efficiency, I believe that AI applications will become more useful and ubiquitous, and thus demand will increase. We will see how this pans out, but the initial panic has subsided, and today saw Nvidia’s stock recover somewhat. My personal take...

A fool and his money are some party... and the AI hawkers are partying all the way to their Cayman Island accounts. I suspect the Nvidia chips are too expensive and too power hungry for consumer use. They’re probably too capable for widespread military use. They’re great chips, but their market may not be as large as hoped for. Be aware, I’m not a great investor. My mom with an eighth-grade education was a great investor. “Technology stocks were rocked to their core” NVDA still up 100% in a year. 2,000% in five years. Qwen, also known as Tongyi Qianwen (通义千问), is a family of large language models developed by Alibaba. The latest version, Qwen 2.5, has been making headlines for its impressive performance. Alibaba claims that Qwen 2.5 outperforms other leading AI models, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, DeepSeek’s V3, and Meta’s Llama 3.1. Copilot: Qwen Every country in the world is going to require millions of them for data centres that are currently being planned or under construction. The market for NVIDIA chips is going to be strong for a long time to come. “I suspect the Nvidia chips are too expensive and too power hungry for consumer use. They’re probably too capable for widespread military use.” Nvidia has consumer GPU chips. Here is a gaming PC for $849. https://www.bestbuy.com/site/cyberpowerpc-gamer-master-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-5-5500-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-8gb-1tb-ssd-black/6575120.p?skuId=6575120 Then there are their “AI” processors which are used to train AI programs. Go figure. ChiComms lied. Their spyware is a house of cards. Yes, I saw that too, thanks. The Tech Space is always crackling with energy, and much of it is reciprocal. More importantly... What did Nancy Pelosi do? New technology disrupts but that is how new growth curves are created. Sometimes disruptive technologies like AI get disrupted because that’s where the focus of innovation is. Some like Apple have often done to themselves because they are already thinking at least one generation ahead. The timing may be a surprise but as one who is long on NVDA. I will be interested in how they respond over the next few quarters. And Nvidia is more than a chip company. They are a software and network company. As an example, they have more software engineers than hardware. Their CUDA environment leads the AI deployment systems. It compiles a number of languages for AI use on their chips. Their purchase of Mellanox gave them the fast network technology for data centers. I bought NVDA Monday and yesterday. There’s nothing about DeepSeek that indicates the need for Nvidia’s GPUs is going to decline. And I don’t need the money short-term.

Title: Alibaba releases AI model to challenge DeepSeek days after market sell-off

Time Published: 2025-01-29T15:52:00Z

Days after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a global tech stock sell-off, a homegrown rival said its new AI model performed even better. Alibaba Cloud (BABA) released an upgraded version of its flagship AI model, Qwen2.5-Max, that performed better than top open-source competitors, including DeepSeek’s V3 model and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 model on various benchmarks, according to results published by the firm on WeChat. The cloud computing subsidiary of Alibaba Group also found its Qwen2.5-Max showed comparable performance to OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet — both closed-source models. The Chinese firm said its AI model “has demonstrated world-leading model performance in mainstream authoritative benchmarks,” including the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), which evaluates general knowledge, and LiveCodeBench, which tests coding skills. The Qwen2.5-Max announcement follows DeepSeek’s launch of its first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, last week, which demonstrated comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models, O1-mini and O1, on several industry benchmarks, according to its technical paper. The release of DeepSeek-R1 prompted Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P 500 futures to fall Monday morning. Nvidia’s (NVDA) shares plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. Investors were spooked by the DeepSeek-R1 launch, which comes after the December release of DeepSeek-V3. While Alibaba Cloud hasn’t disclosed its development costs, DeepSeek’s claim that it built its model for just $5.6 million using Nvidia’s reduced-capability graphics processing units has caught the market’s attention, challenging assumptions about the massive investments needed for AI development. According to the technical paper, DeepSeek used a cluster of just under 2,050 Nvidia H800 chips for training its V3 model — a less powerful version of the chipmaker’s H100 that it is allowed to sell to Chinese firms under U.S. chip restrictions. The cluster is also much smaller than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. DeepSeek’s release has called Big Tech’s tens of billions in spending on AI into question ahead of a slate of earnings results, as well as the effectiveness of U.S. efforts to curb advanced chips from entering the country.

Title: The paradox at the heart of the AI debate

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/29/2025 7:50:24 AM PST by Red Badger Investors in energy stocks panicked this week over the release of a new, cheaper AI model, ignoring an argument that reducing the energy needs of such models could actually increase demand for energy overall. Why it matters: The news could end up being bullish for those stocks, which lost more than $40 billion in value on Monday. How it works: The Jevons Paradox, as first formulated in 1865 by English economist William Stanley Jevons, states that greater efficiency in the use of any given resource can result in increased demand for that resource. His example was coal: After the Watt steam engine was introduced — which burned much less coal than its predecessors — demand for coal rose substantially, as Watt's engines were built into a wide range of applications. What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

How it works: The Jevons Paradox, as first formulated in 1865 by English economist William Stanley Jevons, states that greater efficiency in the use of any given resource can result in increased demand for that resource. His example was coal: After the Watt steam engine was introduced — which burned much less coal than its predecessors — demand for coal rose substantially, as Watt's engines were built into a wide range of applications. What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications.

If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

It’s been another *checks notes* two days, so it’s time for all the latest DeepSeek news. You can also see my previous coverage of the r1 model and, from Monday various reactions including the Panic at the App Store. Before we get to new developments, I especially want to reiterate and emphasize the need to calm down about that $5.5 million ‘cost of training’ for v3. I wouldn’t quite agree with Palmer Lucky that ‘the $5m number is bogus’ and I wouldn’t call it a ‘Chinese psyop’ because I think we mostly did this to ourselves but it is very often being used in a highly bogus way – equating the direct compute cost of training v3 with the all-in cost of creating r1. Which is a very different number. DeepSeek is cracked, they cooked, and r1 is super impressive, but the $5.5 million v3 training cost: Altman handled his response to r1 with grace. OpenAI plans to ‘pull up some new releases.’ Meaning, oh, you want to race? I suppose I’ll go faster and take less precautions. Sam Altman: deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. but mostly we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission. the world is going to want to use a LOT of ai, and really be quite amazed by the next gen models coming. look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond. It is very Galaxy Brain to say ‘this is perhaps good for OpenAI’ and presumably it very much is, but here’s a scenario. Ethan Mollick: DeepSeek is a really good model, but it is not generally a better model than o1 or Claude. But since it is both free & getting a ton of attention, I think a lot of people who were using free “mini” models are being exposed to what a early 2025 reasoner AI can do & are surprised I’m not saying that’s the baseline scenario, but I do expect the world to be quite amazed at the next generation of models, and they could now be more primed for that. Mark Chen (Chief Research Officer, OpenAI): Congrats to DeepSeek on producing an o1-level reasoning model! Their research paper demonstrates that they’ve independently found some of the core ideas that we did on our way to o1. However, I think the external response has been somewhat overblown, especially in narratives around cost. One implication of having two paradigms (pre-training and reasoning) is that we can optimize for a capability over two axes instead of one, which leads to lower costs. But it also means we have two axes along which we can scale, and we intend to push compute aggressively into both! As research in distillation matures, we’re also seeing that pushing on cost and pushing on capabilities are increasingly decoupled. The ability to serve at lower cost (especially at higher latency) doesn’t imply the ability to produce better capabilities. We will continue to improve our ability to serve models at lower cost, but we remain optimistic in our research roadmap, and will remain focused in executing on it. We’re excited to ship better models to you this quarter and over the year! Given the costs involved, and that you can scale to get better outputs, ‘serve faster and cheaper’ and ‘get better answers’ seem pretty linked, or are going to look rather similar. There is still a real and important difference between ‘I spend 10x as much compute to get 10x as many tokens to think with’ versus ‘I taught the model how to do longer CoT’ versus ‘I made the model smarter.’ Or at least I think there is. Should we now abandon all our plans to build gigantic data centers because DeepSeek showed we can run AI cheaper? No. Of course not. We’ll need more. Jevons Paradox and all that. Another question is compute governance. Does DeepSeek’s model prove that there’s no point in using compute thresholds for frontier model governance? My answer is no. DeepSeek did not mean the scaling laws stopped working. DeepSeek found new ways to scale and economize, and also to distill. But doing the same thing with more compute would have gotten better results, and indeed more compute is getting other labs better results if you don’t control for compute costs, and also they will now get to use these innovations themselves. Karen Hao: Much of the coverage has focused on U.S.-China tech competition. That misses a bigger story: DeepSeek has demonstrated that scaling up AI models relentlessly, a paradigm OpenAI introduced and champions, is not the only, and far from the best, way to develop AI. Yoavgo: This is trending in my feed, but I don’t get it. DeepSeek did not show that scale is not the way to go for AI (their base model is among the largest in parameter counts; their training data is huge, at 13 trillion tokens). They just scaled more efficiently. Thus far OpenAI & its peer scaling labs have sought to convince the public & policymakers that scaling is the best way to reach so-called AGI. This has always been more of an argument based in business than in science. Jon Stokes: Holy wow what do words even mean. What R1 does is a new type of scaling. It’s also GPU-intensive. In fact, the big mystery today in AI world is why NVIDIA dropped despite R1 demonstrating that GPUs are even more valuable than we thought they were. No part of this is coherent. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): The real takeaway from DeepSeek is that with reasoning models you can achieve great performance with a small amount of compute. Now imagine what you can do with a large amount of compute. Noam Brown (OpenAI): Algorithmic breakthroughs and scaling are complementary, not in competition. The former bends the performance vs compute curve, while the latter moves further along the curve. Benjamin Todd: Deepseek hasn’t shown scaling doesn’t work. Take Deepseek’s techniques, apply 10x the compute, and you’ll get much better performance. And compute efficiency has always been part of the scaling paradigm. Ethan Mollick: The most unnerving part of the DeepSeek reaction online has been seeing folks take it as a sign that AI capability growth is not real. It signals the opposite, large improvements are possible, and is almost certain to kick off an acceleration in AI development through competition. I know a lot of people want AI to go away, but I am seeing so many interpretations of DeepSeek in ways that don’t really make sense, or misrepresent what they did. Dealing with the implications of AI, and trying to steer it towards positive use, is now more urgent, not less. Andrew Rettek: Deepseek means OPENAI just increased their effective compute by more than an OOM. OpenAI and Anthropic (in the forms of CEOs Sam Altman and Dario Amodei) have both expressed agreement on that since the release of r1, saying that they still believe the future involves very large and expensive training runs, including large amounts of compute on the RL step. David Sacks agreed as well, so the administration knows. One can think of all this as combining multiple distinct scaling laws. Mark Chen above talked about two axes but one could refer to at least four? Also you can extend to new modalities and use cases and so on. So essentially: Buckle up. Speaking of buckling up, nothing to see here, just a claimed 2x speed boost to r1, written by r1. Of course, that’s very different from r1 coming up with the idea. Aiden McLaughlin: switching to reasoners is like taking a sharp turn on a racetrack. everyone brakes to take the turn; for a moment, all cars look neck-and-neck when exiting the turn, small first-mover advantages compound. and ofc, some cars have enormous engines that eat up straight roads Dean Ball: I recommend trying not to overindex on the industry dynamics you’re observing now in light of the deepseek plot twist, or indeed of any particular plot twist. It’s a long game, and we’re riding a world-historical exponential. Things will change a lot, fast, again and again. It’s not that Jan is wrong, I’d be a lot more interested in paying for o1 pro if I had pdfs enabled, but… yeah. China Talk covers developments. The headline conclusion is that yes, compute very much will continue to be a key factor, everyone agrees on this. They note there is a potential budding DeepSeek partnership with ByteDance, which could unlock quite a lot of compute. Here was some shade: Founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng is the core person of DeepSeek. He is not the same type of person as Sam Altman. He is very knowledgeable about technology. Also important at least directionally: Pioneers vs. Chasers: ‘AI Progress Resembles a Step Function – Chasers Require 1/10th the Compute’ Fundamentally, DeepSeek was far more of an innovator than other Chinese AI companies, but it was still a chaser here, not a pioneer, except in compute efficiency, which is what chasers do best. If you want to maintain a lead and it’s much easier to follow than lead, well, time to get good and scale even more. Or you can realize you’re just feeding capability to the Chinese and break down crying and maybe keep your models for internal use, it’s an option. I found this odd: It’s odd because DeepSeek spent so little compute, and the efficiency gains pay for themselves in compute quite rapidly. And also the big companies are indeed releasing rapidly. Google and OpenAI are constantly shipping, even Anthropic ships. The idea of company focus seems more on point, and yes DeepSeek traded multimodality and other features for pure efficiency because they had to. Also note what they say later: As in, r1 is technically impressive as hell, and it definitely has its uses, but there’s a reason the existing models look like they do – the corners DeepSeek cut actually do matter for what people want. Of course DeepSeek will likely now turn to fixing such problems among other things and we’ll see how efficiently they can do that too. McKay Wrigley emphasizes the point that visible chain of thought (CoT) is a prompt debugger. It’s hard to go back to not seeing CoT after seeing CoT. Gallabytes reports that DeepSeek’s image model Janus Pro is a good first effort, but not good yet. Even if we were to ‘fully unlock’ all computing power in personal PCs for running AI, that would only increase available compute by ~10%, most compute is in data centers. We had a brief period where DeepSeek would serve you up r1 free and super fast. It turns out that’s not fully sustainable or at least needs time to scale as fast as demand rose, and you know how such folks feel about the ‘raise prices’ meme, Gallabytes: got used to r1 and now that it’s overloaded it’s hard to go back. @deepseek_ai please do something amazing and be the first LLM provider to offer surge pricing. the unofficial APIs are unusably slow. I too encountered slowness, and instantly it made me realize ‘yes the speed was a key part of why I loved this.’ DeItaone (January 27, 11:09am): DEEPSEEK SAYS SERVICE DEGRADED DUE TO ‘LARGE-SCALE MALICIOUS ATTACK’ Could be that. Could be too much demand and not enough supply. This will of course sort itself out in time, as long as you’re willing to pay, and it’s an open model so others can serve the model as well, but ‘everyone wants to use the shiny new model you are offering for free’ is going to run into obvious problems. Yes, of course one consideration is that if you use DeepSeek’s app it will collect all your data including device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address and so on and store it all in China. Did you for a second think otherwise? What you do with that info is on you. This doesn’t appear to rise to TikTok 2.0 levels of rendering your phone and data insecure, but let us say that ‘out of an abundance of caution’ I will be accessing the model through their website not the app thank you very much. Liv Boeree: tiktok round two, here we go. AI enthusiasts have the self control of an incontinent chihuahua. Typing Loudly: you can run it locally without an internet connection Liv Boeree: cool and what percentage of these incontinent chihuahuas will actually do this. I’m not going so far as to use third party providers for now, because I’m not feeding any sensitive data into the model, and DeepSeek’s implementation here is very nice and clean, so I’ve decided lazy is acceptable. I’m certainly not laying out ~$6,000 for a self-hosting rig, unless someone wants to buy one for me in the name of science. Note that if you’re looking for an alternative source, you want to ensure you’re not getting one of the smaller distillations, unless that is what you want. Janus is testing for steganography in r1, potentially looking for assistance. Janus also thinks Thebes theory here is likely to be true, that v3 was hurt by dividing into too many too small experts, but r1 lets them all dump their info into the CoT and collaborate, at least partially fixing this. Janus notes that r1 simply knows things and thinks about them, straight up, in response to Thebes speculating that all our chain of thought considerations have now put sufficient priming into the training data that CoT approaches work much better than they used to, which Prithviraj says is not the case, he says it’s about improved base models, which is the first obvious thought – the techniques work better off a stronger base, simple as that. Thebes: why did R1’s RL suddenly start working, when previous attempts to do similar things failed? theory: we’ve basically spent the last few years running a massive acausally distributed chain of thought data annotation program on the pretraining dataset. deepseek’s approach with R1 is a pretty obvious method. They are far from the first lab to try “slap a verifier on it and roll out CoTs.” But it didn’t used to work that well. … In the last couple of years, chains of thought have been posted all over the internet … Those CoTs in the V3 training set gave GRPO enough of a starting point to start converging, and furthermore, to generalize from verifiable domains to the non-verifiable ones using the bridge established by the pretraining data contamination. And now, R1’s visible chains of thought are going to lead to *another* massive enrichment of human-labeled reasoning on the internet, but on a far larger scale… The next round of base models post-R1 will be *even better* bases for reasoning models. in some possible worlds, this could also explain why OpenAI seemingly struggled so much with making their reasoning models in comparison. if they’re still using 4base or distils of it. Prithvraj: Simply, no. I’ve been looking at my old results from doing RL with “verifiable” rewards (math puzzle games, python code to pass unit tests) starting from 2019 with GPT-1/2 to 2024 with Qwen Math Deepseek’s success likely lies in the base models improving, the RL is constant Janus: This is an interesting hypothesis. DeepSeek R1 also just seems to have a much more lucid and high-resolution understanding of LLM ontology and history than any other model I’ve seen. (DeepSeek V3 did not seem to in my limited interactions with it, though.) I did not expect this on priors for a reasoner, but perhaps the main way that r1 seems smarter than any other LLM I’ve played with is the sheer lucidity and resolution of its world model—in particular, its knowledge of LLMs, both object- and meta-level, though this is also the main domain of knowledge I’ve engaged it in, and perhaps the only one I can evaluate at world-expert level. So, it may apply more generally. In effective fluid intelligence and attunement to real-time context, it actually feels weaker than, say, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. But when I talk to Sonnet about my ideas on LLMs, it feels like it is more naive than me, and it is figuring out a lot of things in context from “first principles.” When I talk to Opus about these things, it feels like it is understanding me by projecting the concepts onto more generic, resonant hyperobjects in its prior, meaning it is easy to get on the same page philosophically, but this tropological entanglement is not very precise. But with r1, it seems like it can simply reference the same concrete knowledge and ontology I have, much more like a peer. And it has intense opinions about these things. Wordgrammer thread on the DeepSeek technical breakthroughs. Here’s his conclusion, which seems rather overdetermined: Wordgrammer: “Is the US losing the war in AI??” I don’t think so. DeepSeek had a few big breakthroughs, we have had hundreds of small breakthroughs. If we adopt DeepSeek’s architecture, our models will be better. Because we have more compute and more data. r1 tells us it only takes ~800k samples of ‘good’ RL reasoning to convert other models into RL reasoners, and Alex Dimakis says it could be a lot less, in his test they outperformed o1-preview with only 17k. Now that r1 is out, everyone permanently has an unlimited source of at least pretty good samples. From now on, to create or release a model is to create or release the RL version of that model, even more than before. That’s on top of all the other modifications you automatically release. Oliver Blanchard: DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive tfp shock in the history of the world. The nerdy version, to react to some of the comments. (Yes, electricity was big): DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive one day change in the present discounted value of total factor productivity growth in the history of the world. James Steuart: I can’t agree Professor, Robert Gordon’s book gives many such greater examples. Electric lighting is a substantially greater TFP boost than marginally better efficiency in IT and professional services! There were some bigger inventions in the past, but on much smaller baselines. Our reaction to this was to sell the stocks of those who provide the inputs that enable that tfp shock. There were other impacts as well, including to existential risk, but as we’ve established the market isn’t ready for that conversation in the sense that the market (highly reasonably as has been previously explained) will be ignoring it entirely. Daniel Eth: Hot take, but if the narrative from NYT et al had not been “lol you don’t need that many chips to train AI systems” but instead “Apparently AI is *not* hitting a wall”, then the AI chip stocks would have risen instead of fallen. Billy Humblebrag: “Deepseek shows that ai can be built more cheaply than we thought so you don’t need to worry about ai” is a hell of a take Joe Weisenthal: Morgan Stanley: “We gathered feedback from a number of industry sources and the consistent takeaway is that this is not affecting plans for GPU buildouts.” I would not discount the role of narrative and vibes in all this. I don’t think that’s the whole Nvidia drop or anything. But it matters. Roon: Plausible reasons for Nvidia drop: We will want more compute now until the heat death of the universe; it’s the only reason that doesn’t make sense. Palmer Lucky: The markets are not smarter on AI. The free hand is not yet efficient because the number of legitimate experts in the field is near-zero. The average person making AI calls on Wall Street had no idea what AI even was a year ago and feels compelled to justify big moves. Alex Cheema notes that Apple was up on Monday, and that Apple’s chips are great for running v3 and r1 inference. Alex Cheema: Market close: $NVDA: -16.91% | $AAPL: +3.21% Why is DeepSeek great for Apple? Here’s a breakdown of the chips that can run DeepSeek V3 and R1 on the market now: NVIDIA H100: 80GB @ 3TB/s, $25,000, $312.50 per GB AMD MI300X: 192GB @ 5.3TB/s, $20,000, $104.17 per GB Apple M2 Ultra: 192GB @ 800GB/s, $5,000, $26.04(!!) per GB Apple’s M2 Ultra (released in June 2023) is 4x more cost efficient per unit of memory than AMD MI300X and 12x more cost efficient than NVIDIA H100! Eric Hartford: 3090s, $700 for 24gb = $29/gb. Alex Cheema: You need a lot of hardware around them to load a 700GB model in 30 RTX 3090s. I’d love to see it though, closest to this is probably stacking @__tinygrad__ boxes. That’s cute. But I do not think that was the main reason why Apple was up. I think Apple was up because their strategy doesn’t depend on having frontier models but it does depend on running AIs on iPhones. Apple can now get their own distillations of r1, and use them for Apple Intelligence. A highly reasonable argument. The One True Newsletter, Matt Levine’s Money Stuff, is of course on the case of DeepSeek’s r1 crashing the stock market, and asking what cheap inference for everyone would do to market prices. He rapidly shifts focus to non-AI companies, asking which ones benefit. It’s great if you use AI to make your management company awesome, but not if you get cut out because AI replaces your management company. (And you. And the people it manages. And all of us. And maybe we all die.) But I digress. (To digress even further: While I’m reading that column, I don’t understand why we should care about the argument under ‘Dark Trading,’ since this mechanism decreases retail transaction costs to trade and doesn’t impact long term price discovery at all, and several LLMs confirmed this once challenged.) Ben Thompson continues to give his completely different kind of technical tech company perspective, in FAQ format, including good technical explanations that agree with what I’ve said in previous columns. Here’s a fascinating line: Q: I asked why the stock prices are down; you just painted a positive picture! A: My picture is of the long run; today is the short run, and it seems likely the market is working through the shock of R1’s existence. That sounds like Ben Thompson is calling it a wrong-way move, and indeed later he explicitly endorses Jevons Paradox and expects compute use to rise. The market is supposed to factor in the long run now. There is no ‘this makes the price go down today and then up next week’ unless you’re very much in the ‘the EMH is false’ camp. And these are literally the most valuable companies in the world. Here’s another key one: Q: So are we close to AGI? A: It definitely seems like it. This also explains why Softbank (and whatever investors Masayoshi Son brings together) would provide the funding for OpenAI that Microsoft will not: the belief that we are reaching a takeoff point where there will in fact be real returns towards being first. Masayoshi Sun feels the AGI. Masayoshi Sun feels everything. He’s king of feeling it. His typical open-model-stanning arguments on existential risk later in the past are as always disappointing, but in no way new or unexpected. It continues to astound me that such intelligent people can think: Well, there’s no stopping us creating things more capable and intelligent than humans, so the best way to ensure that things smarter than more capable than humans go well for humans is to ensure that there are as many such entities as possible and that humans cannot possibly have any collective control over those new entities. On another level, of course, I’ve accepted that people do think this. That they somehow cannot fathom that if you create things more intelligent and capable and competitive than humans there could be the threat that all the humans would end up with no power, rather than that the wrong humans might have too much power. Or think that this would be a good thing – because the wrong humans wouldn’t have power. Similarly, Ben’s call for absolutely no regulations whatsoever, no efforts at safety whatsoever outside of direct profit motives, ‘cut out all the cruft in our companies that has nothing to do with winning,’ is exactly the kind of rhetoric I worry about getting us all killed in response to these developments. I should still reiterate that Ben to his credit is very responsible and accurate here in his technical presentation, laying out what DeepSeek and r1 are and aren’t accomplishing here rather than crying missile gap. But the closing message remains the same. The term Trump uses is ‘tariffs.’ I propose, at least in the context of GPUs, that we call these ‘import restrictions,’ in order to point out that we are (I believe wisely!) imposing ‘export restrictions’ as a matter of national security to ensure we get all the chips, and using diffusion regulations to force the chips to be hosted at home, then we are threatening to impose ‘up to 100%’ tariffs on those same chips, because ‘they left us’ and they want ‘to force them to come back,’ and they’ll build the new factories here instead of there, with their own money, because of the threat. Except for the fact that we really, really want the data centers at home. The diffusion regulations are largely to force companies to create them at home. Arthur B: Regarding possible US tariffs on Taiwan chips. First, this is one that US consumers would directly feel, it’s less politically feasible than tariffs on imports with lots of substitutes. Second, data centers don’t have to be located in the US. Canada is next door and has plenty of power. Dhiraj: Taiwan made the largest single greenfield FDI in US history through TSMC. Now, instead of receiving gratitude for helping the struggling US chip industry, Taiwan faces potential tariffs. In his zero-sum worldview, there are no friends. The whole thing is insane! Completely nuts. If he’s serious. And yes he said this on Joe Rogan previously, but he said a lot of things previously that he didn’t mean. Whereas Trump’s worldview is largely the madman theory, at least for trade. If you threaten people with insane moves that would hurt both of you, and show that you’re willing to actually enact insane moves, then they are forced to give you what you want. In this case, what Trump wants is presumably for TSMC to announce they are building more new chip factories in America. I agree that this would be excellent, assuming they were actually built. We have an existence proof that it can be done, and it would greatly improve our strategic position and reduce geopolitical risk. I presume Trump is mostly bluffing, in that he has no intention of actually imposing these completely insane tariffs, and he will ultimately take a minor win and declare victory. But what makes it nerve wracking is that, by design, you never know. If you did know none of this would ever work. Unless, some people wondered, there was another explanation for all this… Nabeel Qureshi (Tuesday, 2pm): Crazy that people in this corner of X have a faster OODA loop than the stock market This was the largest single day drop in a single stock in world history. It wiped out over $500 billion in market value. One had to wonder if it was partially insider trading. Timothy Lee: Everyone says DeepSeek caused Nvidia’s stock to crash yesterday. I think this theory makes no sense. DeepSeek’s success isn’t bad news for Nvidia. I don’t think that this was insider trading. The tariff threat was already partly known and thus priced in. It’s a threat rather than an action, which means it’s likely a bluff. That’s not a 17% move. Then we have the bounceback on Tuesday. Even if I was certain that this was mostly an insider trading move instead of being rather confident it mostly or entirely wasn’t, I wouldn’t go as far as Eliezer does in the the below quote. The SEC does many important things. But I do notice that there’s a non-zero amount of ‘wait a minute’ that will occur to me the next time I’m hovering around the buy button in haste. Eliezer Yudkowsky: I heard from many people who said, “An NVDA drop makes no sense as a Deepseek reaction; buying NVDA.” So those people have now been cheated by insider counterparties with political access. They may make fewer US trades in the future. Also note that the obvious meaning of this news is that someone told and convinced Trump that China will invade Taiwan before the end of his term, and the US needs to wean itself off Taiwanese dependence. This was a $400B market movement, and if @SECGov can’t figure out who did it then the SEC has no reason to exist. TBC, I’m not saying that figuring it out would be easy or bringing the criminals to justice would be easy. I’m saying that if the US markets are going to be like this anyway on $400B market movements, why bother paying the overhead cost of having an SEC that doesn’t work? Roon: [Trump’s tariff threats about Taiwan] didn’t move overnight markets at all which either means markets either: – don’t believe it’s credible – were pricing this in yesterday while internet was blaming the crash out on deepseek I certainly don’t agree that the only interpretation of this news is ‘Trump expects an invasion of Taiwan.’ Trump is perfectly capable of doing this for exactly the reasons he’s saying. Trump is also fully capable of making this threat with no intention of following through, in order to extract concessions from Taiwan or TSMC, perhaps of symbolic size. Trump is also fully capable of doing this so that he could inform his hedge fund friends in advance and they could make quite a lot of money – with or without any attempt to actually impose the tariffs ever, since his friends would have now covered their shorts in this scenario. Indeed do many things come to pass. I don’t know anything you don’t know. It would be a good sign if DeepSeek had a plan for safety, even if it wasn’t that strong? Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): DeepSeek should create a preparedness framework/RSP if they continue to scale reasoning models. Very happy to [help them with this]! We don’t quite have nothing. This below is the first actively positive sign for DeepSeek on safety, however small. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): Does DeepSeek have any safety researchers? What are Liang Wenfeng’s views on AI safety? Sarah (YuanYuanSunSara): [DeepSeek] signed Artificial Intelligence safety commitment by CAICT (gov backed institute). You can see the whale sign at the bottom if you can’t read their name Chinese. This involves AI safety governance structure, safety testing, do frontier AGI safety research (include loss of control) and share it publicly. None legally binding but it’s a good sign. Here is a chart with the Seoul Commitments versus China’s version. It is of course much better that DeepSeek signed onto a symbolic document like this. That’s a good sign, whereas refusing would have been a very bad sign. But as always, talk is cheap, this doesn’t concretely commit DeepSeek to much, and even fully abiding by commitments like this won’t remotely be enough. I do think this is a very good sign that agreements and coordination are possible. But if we want that, we will have to Pick Up the Phone. Here’s a weird different answer. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI, Head of Mission Alignment): I think a better question is whether or not science fiction culture in China has a fixation on the kinds of topics that would help them think about it. If Three-Body Problem is any indication, things will be OK. It’s a question worth asking, but I don’t think this is a better question? And based on the book, I do not think Three-Body Problem (conceptual spoilers follow, potentially severe ones depending on your perspective) is great here. Consider the decision theory that those books endorse, and what happens to us and also the universe as a result. It’s presenting all of that as essentially inevitable, and trying to think otherwise as foolishness. It’s endorsing that what matters is paranoia, power and a willingness to use it without mercy in an endless war of all against all. Also consider how they paint the history of the universe entirely without AGI. I want to be clear that I fully agree with Bill Gurley that ‘no one at DeepSeek is an enemy of mine,’ indeed There Is No Enemy Anywhere, with at most notably rare exceptions that I invite to stop being exceptions. However, I do think that if they continue down their current path, they are liable to get us all killed. And I for one am going to take the bold stance that I think that this is bad, and they should therefore alter their path before reaching their stated destination. How committed is DeepSeek to its current path? Read this quote Ben Thompson links to very carefully: Q: DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it’s open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source. Answer from DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important. This is from November. And that’s not a no. That’s actually a maybe. Note what he didn’t say: A Different Answer: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem is more important. The difference? His answer includes the word ‘first.’ He’s saying that first you need a strong technical ecosystem, and he believes that open models are the key to attracting talent and developing a strong technical ecosystem. Then, once that exists, you would need to protect your advantage. And yes, that is exactly what happened with… OpenAI. I wanted to be sure that this translation was correct, so I turned to Wenfang’s own r1, and asked the interviewer for the original statement, which was: 梁文锋：我们不会闭源。我们认为先有一个强大的技术生态更重要。 r1’s translation: “We will not close our source code. We believe that establishing a strong technological ecosystem must come first.” To quote r1: Based solely on this statement, Liang is asserting that openness is non-negotiable because it is essential to the ecosystem’s strength. While no one can predict the future, the phrasing suggests a long-term commitment to open-source as a core value, not a temporary tactic. To fully guarantee permanence, you’d need additional evidence (e.g., licensing choices, governance models, past behavior). But as it stands, the statement leans toward “permanent” in spirit. I interpret this as a statement of a pragmatic motivation – if that motivation changes, or a more important one is created, actions would change. For now, yes, openness. The Washington Post had a profile of DeepSeek and Liang Wenfeng. One note is that the hedge fund that they’re a spinoff from has donated over $80 million to charity since 2020, which makes it more plausible DeepSeek has no business model, or at least no medium-term business model. But that government embrace is new for DeepSeek, said Matt Sheehan, an expert on China’s AI industry at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “They were not the ‘chosen one’ of Chinese AI start-ups,” said Sheehan, noting that many other Chinese start-ups received more government funding and contracts. “DeepSeek took the world by surprise, and I think to a large extent, they took the Chinese government by surprise.” Sheehan added that for DeepSeek, more government attention will be a “double-edged sword.” While the company will probably have more access to government resources, “there’s going to be a lot of political scrutiny on them, and that has a cost of its own,” he said. Yes. This reinforces the theory that DeepSeek’s ascent took China’s government by surprise, and they had no idea what v3 and r1 were as they were released. Going forward, China is going to be far more aware. In some ways, DeepSeek will have lots of support. But there will be strings attached. That starts with the ordinary censorship demands of the CCP. If you self-host r1, and you ask it about any of the topics the CCP dislikes, r1 will give you a good, well-balanced answer. If you ask on DeepSeek’s website, it will censor you via some sort of cloud-based monitoring, which works if you’re closed source, but DeepSeek is trying to be fully open source. Something has to give, somewhere. Also, even if you’re using the official website, it’s not like you can’t get around it. Justine Moore: DeepSeek’s censorship is no match for the jailbreakers of Reddit I mean, that was easy. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI Head of Mission Alignment): This has deeply fascinating consequences for China in 10 years – when the CCP has to choose between allowing their AI industry to move forward, or maintaining censorship and tight ideological control, which will they choose? And if they choose their AI industry, especially if they favor open source as a strategy for worldwide influence: what does it mean for their national culture and government structure in the long run, when everyone who is curious can find ways to have subversive conversations? Ten years to figure this out? If they’re lucky, they’ve got two. My guess is they don’t. I worry about the failure to feel the AGI or even the AI here from Joshua Achiam, given his position at OpenAI. Ten years is a long time. Sam Altman expects AGI well before that. This goes well beyond Altman’s absurd position of ‘AGI will be invented and your life won’t noticeably change for a long time.’ Choices are going to need to be made. Even if AI doesn’t advance much from here, choices will have to be made. As I’ve noted before, censorship at the model layer is expensive. It’s harder to do, and when you do it you risk introducing falsity into a mind in ways that will have widespread repercussions. Even then, a fine tune can easily remove any gaps in knowledge, or any reluctance to discuss particular topics, whether they are actually dangerous things like building bombs or things that piss off the CCP like a certain bear that loves honey. I got called out on Twitter for supposed cognitive dissonance on this – look at China’s actions, they clearly let this happen. Again, my claim is that China didn’t realize what this was until after it happened, they can’t undo it (that’s the whole point!) and they are of course going to embrace their national champion. That has little to do with what paths DeepSeek is allowed to follow going forward. (Also, since it was mentioned in that response, I should note – there is a habit of people conflating ‘pause’ with ‘ever do anything to regulate AI at all.’ I do not believe I said anything about a pause – I was talking about whether China would let DeepSeek continue to release open weights as capabilities improve.) Before I further cover potential policy responses, a question we must ask this week is: I very much do not wish to do this at this time, but suppose in the future we did want to restrict use of a particular already open weights model and its derivatives, or all models in some reference class. What would our options be? Obviously we couldn’t fully ban it in terms of preventing determined people from having access. And if you try to stop them and others don’t, there are obvious problems with that, including ‘people have internet connections.’ However, that does not mean that we would have actual zero options. Steve Sailer: Does open source, low cost DeepSeek mean that there is no way, short of full-blown Butlerian Jihad against computers, which we won’t do, to keep AI bottled up, so we’re going to find out if Yudkowsky’s warnings that AI will go SkyNet and turn us into paperclips are right? Gabriel: It’s a psy-op If hosting a 70B is illegal: – Almost all individuals stop – All companies stop – All research labs stop – All compute providers stop Already huge if limited to US+EU Can argue about whether good/bad, but not about the effect size. You can absolutely argue about effect size. What you can’t argue is that the effect size isn’t large. It would make a big difference for many practical purposes. In terms of my ‘Levels of Friction’ framework (post forthcoming) this is moving the models from Level 1 (easy to access) to at least Level 3 (annoying with potential consequences.) That has big practical consequences, and many important use cases will indeed go away or change dramatically. What Level 3 absolutely won’t do, here or elsewhere, is save you from determined people who want it badly enough, or from sufficiently capable models that do not especially care what you tell them not to do or where you tell them not to be. Or scenarios where the law is no longer especially relevant, and the government or humanity is very much having a ‘do you feel in charge?’ moment. And that alone would, in many scenarios, be enough to doom you to varying degrees. If that’s what dooms you and the model is already open, well, you’re pretty doomed. And also it won’t save you from various scenarios where what the law thinks is not especially relevant. If for whatever reason the government or humanity decides (or realizes) that this is insufficient, then there are two possibilities. Either the government or humanity is disempowered and you hope that this works out for humanity in some way. Or we use the necessary means to push the restrictions up to Level 4 (akin to rape and murder) or Level 5 (akin to what we do to stop terrorism or worse), in ways I assure you that you are very much not going to like – but the alternative might be worse, and the decision might very much not be up to either of us. Actions have consequences. Plan for them. Adam Ozimek was first I saw point out this time around with DeepSeek (I and many others echo this a lot in general) that the best way for the Federal Government to ensure American dominance of AI is to encourage more high skilled immigration and brain drain the world. If you don’t want China to have DeepSeek, export controls are great and all but how about let’s straight up steal their engineers. But y’all, and by y’all I mean Donald Trump, aren’t ready for that conversation. It is highly unfortunate that David Sacks, the person seemingly in charge of what AI executive orders Trump signs, is so deeply confused about what various provisions actually did or would do, and on our regulatory situation relative to that of China. David Sacks: DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO, which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same. (Obviously not.) I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent. Donald Trump: The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win. … We’re going to dominate. We’ll dominate everything. This is the biggest danger of all – that we go full Missile Gap jingoism and full-on race to ‘beat China,’ and act like we can’t afford to do anything to ensure the safety of the AGIs and ASIs we plan on building, even pressuring labs not to make such efforts in private, or threatening them with antitrust or other interventions for trying. The full Trump clip is hilarious, including him saying they may have come up with a cheaper method but ‘no one knows if it is true.’ His main thrust is, oh, you made doing AI cheaper and gave it all away to us for free, thanks, that’s great! I love paying less money for things! And he’s presumably spinning, but he’s also not wrong about that. I also take some small comfort in him framing revoking the Biden EO purely in terms of wokeness. If that’s all he thinks was bad about it, that’s a great sign. Harlan Stewart: “Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment” Sure. I guess it’s like if the Soviets had told the world how to make their own Sputniks and also offered everyone a lifetime supply of free Sputniks. And the US had already previously figured out how to make an even bigger Sputnik. Yishan: I think the Deepseek moment is not really the Sputnik moment, but more like the Google moment. If anyone was around in ~2004, you’ll know what I mean, but more on that later. I think everyone is over-rotated on this because Deepseek came out of China. Let me try to un-rotate you. Deepseek could have come out of some lab in the US Midwest. Like say some CS lab couldn’t afford the latest nVidia chips and had to use older hardware, but they had a great algo and systems department, and they found a bunch of optimizations and trained a model for a few million dollars and lo, the model is roughly on par with o1. Look everyone, we found a new training method and we optimized a bunch of algorithms! Everyone is like OH WOW and starts trying the same thing. Great week for AI advancement! No need for US markets to lose a trillion in market cap. The tech world (and apparently Wall Street) is massively over-rotated on this because it came out of CHINA. … Deepseek is MUCH more like the Google moment, because Google essentially described what it did and told everyone else how they could do it too. … There is no reason to think nVidia and OAI and Meta and Microsoft and Google et al are dead. Sure, Deepseek is a new and formidable upstart, but doesn’t that happen every week in the world of AI? I am sure that Sam and Zuck, backed by the power of Satya, can figure something out. Everyone is going to duplicate this feat in a few months and everything just got cheaper. The only real consequence is that AI utopia/doom is now closer than ever. I believe that alignment, and getting a good outcome for humans, was already going to be very hard. It’s going to be a lot harder if we actively try to get ourselves killed like this, and turn even what would have been relatively easy wins into losses. Whereas no, actually, if you want to win that has to include not dying, and also doing the alignment work helps you win, because it is the only way you can (sanely) get to deploy your AIs to do the most valuable tasks. Trump’s reaction of ‘we’ll dominate everything’ is far closer to correct. Our ‘lead’ is smaller than we thought, DeepSeek will be real competition, but we are very much still in the dominant position. We need to not lose sight of that. The Washington Post covers panic in Washington, and attempts to exploit this situation to do the opposite of wise policy. Tiku, Dou, Zakrzewski and De Vynck: Tech stocks dropped Monday. Spooked U.S. officials, engineers and investors reconsidered their views on the competitive threat posed by China in AI, and how the United States could stay ahead. While some Republicans and the Trump administration suggested the answer was to restrain China, prominent tech industry voices said DeepSeek’s ascent showed the benefits of openly sharing AI technology instead of keeping it closely held. This shows nothing of the kind, of course. DeepSeek fast followed, copied our insights and had insights of their own. Our insights were held insufficiently closely to prevent this, which at that stage was mostly unavoidable. They have now given away many of those new valuable insights, which we and others will copy, and also made the situation more dangerous. We should exploit that and learn from it, not make the same mistake. Robert Sterling: Might be a dumb question, but can’t OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies just incorporate the best parts of DeepSeek’s source code into their code, then use the massive GPU clusters at their disposal to train models even more powerful than DeepSeek? Am I missing something? Peter Wildeford: Not a dumb question, this is 100% correct And they already have more powerful models than Deepseek I fear we are caught between two different insane reactions. Restraining China is a good idea if implemented well, but insufficiently specified. Restrain them how? If this means export controls, I strongly agree – and then ask when we are then considering imposing those controls on ourselves via tariffs? What else is available? And I will keep saying ‘how about immigration to brain drain them’ because it seems wrong to ignore the utterly obvious. Chamath Palihapitiya says it’s inference time, we need to boot up our allies with it as quickly as possible (I agree) and that we should also boot up China by lifting export controls on inference chips, and also focus on supplying the Middle East. He notes he has a conflict of interest here. It seems not especially wise to hand over serious inference compute if we’re in a fight here. With the way these models are going, there’s a decent amount of fungibility between inference and training, and also there’s going to be tons of demand for inference. Why is it suddenly important to Chamath that the inference be done on chips we sold them? Capitalist insists rope markets must remain open during this trying time, and so on. (There’s also talk about ‘how asleep we’ve been for 15 years’ because we’re so inefficient and seriously everyone needs to calm down on this kind of thinking.) So alas, in the short run, we are left scrambling to prevent two equal and opposite deadly mistakes we seem to be dangerously close to collectively making. The CEO of DeepSeek himself said in November that the export controls and inability to access chips were the limiting factors on what they could do. Compute is vital. What did DeepSeek ask for with its newfound prestige? Support for compute infrastructure in China. Do not respond by being so suicidal as to remove or weaken those controls. Or, to shorten all that: Don’t do those things! Do take advantage of all the opportunities that have been opened up. And of course: Don’t panic!

Title: Microsoft thinks China's DeepSeek might have used OpenAI's tech before its big breakthrough

Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI are investigating whether a group connected to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek accessed OpenAI’s data without permission, according to a new report. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that Microsoft’s security team noticed unusual activity last fall in which individuals, believed to be linked to DeepSeek, accessed large amounts of data through OpenAI’s application programming interface (API). The ChatGPT maker’s API allows software developers to license and use the company’s proprietary AI models into their own applications. However, the breach may have violated OpenAI’s terms of service and appeared to be an attempt to bypass restrictions on how much data can be accessed from the service. Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, flagged the issue to the company, Bloomberg reports. Last week, the Hangzhou-based AI startup DeepSeek introduced its first-generation, open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, that demonstrated comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models. The release prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks, with the Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P 500 all falling Monday morning. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) saw its stock plummet 17%, losing close to $600 billion in value — the largest single-day market cap loss ever for a U.S. company. At the same time, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store, while its site experienced outages from an influx of new users. Investors were spooked by the Chinese startup, which released its DeepSeek-V3 model in December that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s more powerful chips. The U.S. National Security Council is already reviewing the potential national security risks associated with DeepSeek, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday. Leavitt noted that President Donald Trump views the startup’s newly released AI model as a “wake-up call” for American developers. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tech led stocks lower on Wednesday morning as the broader mood stayed muted ahead of the first Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more 0.7%, after a bounce-back rally on Tuesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat. The looming Fed policy verdict is providing reason for markets to tread carefully, even though the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates. Investors will listen for answers to two key questions at Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference: How much further will the Fed cut rates and has the central bank changed its stance in light of President Trump's early tariff moves? Meanwhile, a surprise rise in bookings for ASML (ASML), a key toolmaker in the AI chip chain, gave another boost to techs starting to recover from a bruising start to the week. Shares of ASML popped 5% in early trading, with peers like Applied Materials (AMAT) also making gains. Nvidia (NVDA), however, didn't catch a boost, with shares down nearly 5%, as its Tuesday comeback faltered. Markets are now taking a cooler look at Chinese startup DeepSeek's challenge to assumptions about AI spending and costs. Shares of Alibaba (BABA) moved up more than 4% after the Chinese tech giant released a new AI model that it said is better than DeepSeek's rival to ChatGPT. The saga deepened with claims by Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI that DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its competitor. The spotlight is now on the guidance in Meta (META) and Microsoft's quarterly results, due after the bell, for reassurance that Big Tech's heavy AI spending will pay off in growth. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out Wednesday's megacap earnings, with Wall Street watching for a new catalyst to jump-start the stock. Nvidia (NVDA) stock tanked on Monday, falling more than 17% and losing nearly $600 billion off its market cap, as investors digested a new cost-effective artificial intelligence model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. But retail investors bought the dip. Data from VandaTrack shows retail investors bought more than $562 million of the name on Monday, the largest single day inflow into the stock in VandaTrack's data. On Tuesday, as the stock rebounded and rose roughly 9%, there was once again a large swath of retail buying totaling nearly $360 million. Across the two days of chaotic market action, retail investors sent more than $920 million into shares of Nvidia. Wall street strategists largely agreed with retail's bullish outlook on the name. "We think this is probably going to end up a buy the dip Nvidia moment," Fundstrat head of Research Tom Lee said in a video to clients on Monday night. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith the DeepSeek driven sell-off was "overblown." Rasgon added that the new developments don't spell out "doomsday for AI infrastructure." Starbucks (SBUX) shares are up more than 5% after reporting quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports: Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is promising more caffeinated growth but isn't yet ready to put hard projections around when. And for now, that continues to be enough for Wall Street. On its earnings call, the company highlighted improved sequential sales trends in the US as it worked to speed up mobile orders and end upcharging for dairy substitutes, among other changes. "I think we're definitely in the middle of a turnaround," Niccol said on Yahoo Finance. Read more here. It's been a whipsaw week of trading action for AI leader Nvidia (NVDA). The stock lost a record $589 billion in market cap on Monday, with shares falling roughly 17% as a new artificial intelligence model from China's DeepSeek raised questions about AI investment and the rise of more cost-efficient AI agents. Then Tuesday brought a rebound, with the stock closing 9% higher. But Wednesday's early action saw the the stock fall nearly 4%. That shows the AI chipmaker isn't out of the woods yet, as investors await earnings results from key Nvidia customers after the bell in Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA). ASML (ASML) stock rose 6% early Wednesday after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips. ASML sells highly complex machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses those machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights. The Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of 6.85 euros ($7.12), ahead of the 6.68 euros expected. Its quarterly revenue of 9.2 billion euros topped the 9 billion euros forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. ASML also posted stronger-than-expected order bookings, reflecting strong demand from AI chipmakers for its advanced tools. Meanwhile, its CEO Christophe Fouquet told CNBC in an interview about the impact of DeepSeek's new AI models: “We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand." Read the full story here. Stocks wavered on Wednesday morning with the broader mood muted ahead of the first Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's rate decision. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more than 0.3%, after a bounce-back rally on Tuesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was just above the flat line. The looming Fed policy verdict is providing reason for markets to tread carefully, even though the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) shares rose nearly 15% in premarket trading after the company linked to President Donald Trump announced an expansion into financial services. The operator of Truth Social will launch a financial services and fintech brand dubbed "Truth.Fi." The board approved a $250 million investment of its cash reserves into customized separately managed accounts (SMAs), customized exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as bitcoin (BTC-USD) and similar cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities. "We began by creating a free-speech social media platform, added an ultra-fast TV streaming service, and now we're moving into investment products and decentralized finance," TMTG CEO and chairman Devin Nunes said in the release. "Developing American First investment vehicles is another step toward our goal of creating a robust ecosystem through which American patriots can protect themselves from the ever-present threat of cancellation, censorship, debanking, and privacy violations committed by Big Tech and woke corporations." Oppenheimer has joined its peers at Loop Capital and Jefferies in cutting its rating on shares of Apple (AAPL) in the run-up to the company's fiscal first quarter results, due out after the bell tomorrow. OpCo cut its rating on Apple to Perform from Outperform, according to a report from Bloomberg, with the firm citing slowing iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation, similar cases to those made by Loop and Jefferies last week. On Monday, Apple was a market leader amid a washout in AI-related plays, most notably Nvidia (NVDA), which lost nearly $600 billion in market value. This was a silver lining of sorts during a period in which the company has been a notable laggard relative to its peers in deploying AI across its product line. And with Apple set to report results for its holiday quarter on Thursday — its most important quarter of the year for iPhone sales — Wall Street is bracing its clients for a mild disappointment.

Tech led stocks lower on Wednesday morning as the broader mood stayed muted ahead of the first Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more 0.7%, after a bounce-back rally on Tuesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat. The looming Fed policy verdict is providing reason for markets to tread carefully, even though the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates. Investors will listen for answers to two key questions at Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference: How much further will the Fed cut rates and has the central bank changed its stance in light of President Trump's early tariff moves? Meanwhile, a surprise rise in bookings for ASML (ASML), a key toolmaker in the AI chip chain, gave another boost to techs starting to recover from a bruising start to the week. Shares of ASML popped 5% in early trading, with peers like Applied Materials (AMAT) also making gains. Nvidia (NVDA), however, didn't catch a boost, with shares down nearly 5%, as its Tuesday comeback faltered. Markets are now taking a cooler look at Chinese startup DeepSeek's challenge to assumptions about AI spending and costs. Shares of Alibaba (BABA) moved up more than 4% after the Chinese tech giant released a new AI model that it said is better than DeepSeek's rival to ChatGPT. The saga deepened with claims by Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI that DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its competitor. The spotlight is now on the guidance in Meta (META) and Microsoft's quarterly results, due after the bell, for reassurance that Big Tech's heavy AI spending will pay off in growth. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out Wednesday's megacap earnings, with Wall Street watching for a new catalyst to jump-start the stock. Starbucks (SBUX) shares are up more than 5% after reporting quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports: Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is promising more caffeinated growth but isn't yet ready to put hard projections around when. And for now, that continues to be enough for Wall Street. On its earnings call, the company highlighted improved sequential sales trends in the US as it worked to speed up mobile orders and end upcharging for dairy substitutes, among other changes. "I think we're definitely in the middle of a turnaround," Niccol said on Yahoo Finance. Read more here. It's been a whipsaw week of trading action for AI leader Nvidia (NVDA). The stock lost a record $589 billion in market cap on Monday, with shares falling roughly 17% as a new artificial intelligence model from China's DeepSeek raised questions about AI investment and the rise of more cost-efficient AI agents. Then Tuesday brought a rebound, with the stock closing 9% higher. But Wednesday's early action saw the the stock fall nearly 4%. That shows the AI chipmaker isn't out of the woods yet, as investors await earnings results from key Nvidia customers after the bell in Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA). ASML (ASML) stock rose 6% early Wednesday after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips. ASML sells highly complex machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses those machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights. The Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of 6.85 euros ($7.12), ahead of the 6.68 euros expected. Its quarterly revenue of 9.2 billion euros topped the 9 billion euros forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. ASML also posted stronger-than-expected order bookings, reflecting strong demand from AI chipmakers for its advanced tools. Meanwhile, its CEO Christophe Fouquet told CNBC in an interview about the impact of DeepSeek's new AI models: “We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand." Read the full story here. Stocks wavered on Wednesday morning with the broader mood muted ahead of the first Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's rate decision. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more than 0.3%, after a bounce-back rally on Tuesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was just above the flat line. The looming Fed policy verdict is providing reason for markets to tread carefully, even though the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) shares rose nearly 15% in premarket trading after the company linked to President Donald Trump announced an expansion into financial services. The operator of Truth Social will launch a financial services and fintech brand dubbed "Truth.Fi." The board approved a $250 million investment of its cash reserves into customized separately managed accounts (SMAs), customized exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as bitcoin (BTC-USD) and similar cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities. "We began by creating a free-speech social media platform, added an ultra-fast TV streaming service, and now we're moving into investment products and decentralized finance," TMTG CEO and chairman Devin Nunes said in the release. "Developing American First investment vehicles is another step toward our goal of creating a robust ecosystem through which American patriots can protect themselves from the ever-present threat of cancellation, censorship, debanking, and privacy violations committed by Big Tech and woke corporations." Oppenheimer has joined its peers at Loop Capital and Jefferies in cutting its rating on shares of Apple (AAPL) in the run-up to the company's fiscal first quarter results, due out after the bell tomorrow. OpCo cut its rating on Apple to Perform from Outperform, according to a report from Bloomberg, with the firm citing slowing iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation, similar cases to those made by Loop and Jefferies last week. On Monday, Apple was a market leader amid a washout in AI-related plays, most notably Nvidia (NVDA), which lost nearly $600 billion in market value. This was a silver lining of sorts during a period in which the company has been a notable laggard relative to its peers in deploying AI across its product line. And with Apple set to report results for its holiday quarter on Thursday — its most important quarter of the year for iPhone sales — Wall Street is bracing its clients for a mild disappointment.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a buzzword around Wall Street for most of 2024. AI has shown immense promise but comes with significant risks. Big AI players are dominating the broader market, but there will be opportunities for other companies to explore as the AI market continues to expand. For instance, the new administration is keen on technological advancement, and recently, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion AI initiative, a joint venture known as Stargate between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle. However, DeepSeek’s introduction shocked the U.S. companies after it released a new AI model, a much better alternative to GPT-4. DeepSeek claims to have designed the AI model in just two months and at around under $6 million using Nvidia’s less-advanced H800 chips, as reported by Reuters on January 27. Since the news broke out, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have plunged over 16%, wiping away $600 billion in market capitalization, the biggest one-day loss in U.S. history. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead, speaking to Market Domination, shared his views on DeepSeek. Moorhead was impressed by the efficiency of DeepSeek’s AI. He pointed out that the Chinese have used different techniques compared to American developers, where they were able to parse or train maybe 5% of the data, which is a 95% reduction. However, Moorhead also addressed the U.S. market drop as an “overreaction.” “I think the market overall should be going crazy because [this is the] uplift of what we were looking for [from AI],” said Moorhead. He added that the investors’ focus should be on the progress in inference. It might be a good time to invest in AI stocks, especially cheap AI stocks during the market’s overreaction. To determine the list of cheap AI stocks, we went through various news articles and stock analyses. We shortlisted the AI stocks with the minimum analyst upside of 30%, as of January 27. Cheap, in the context of this article, means stocks that Wall Street analysts believe are undervalued and will surge to higher share prices. We have ranked the cheap AI stocks to buy based on their popularity among hedge funds, as of Q3 2024, in ascending order. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Analyst Upside (as of January 27): 59% No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 107 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA’s counterpart, specializes in manufacturing semiconductors, providing processors, and graphics solutions for gaming, data centers, and embedded systems, with a core focus on high-performance computing using AI use cases. Where NVDA led the AI boom in 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares plunged over 35% in the last year. Earlier in December 2024, someone asked Jim Cramer if he was worried about AMD and the stock’s underperformance. Here is what Cramer said: “This is very difficult, and you’re absolutely right to bring it up, and I’m glad you did. Here’s the problem. It is absolutely true—it is absolutely true that they’re not doing as well as Nvidia. It is true that they do not have the big Amazon orders that I’ve been looking at. But can we just remember that Lisa Su has built an amazing company, taking a lot of shares from Intel? She got the number two when it comes to the data center, when it comes to AI, and come on, she just did the great deal where she got all these engineers to come in. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has transformed its business from a struggling company to a semiconductor leader, with its stock jumping from $3 to $115 over a decade, as of January 27. In 2024, AMD introduced the Instinct MI325X AI accelerators and next-generation networking solutions, focusing on strengthening its position in the AI data center market. The company’s majority of revenue comes from data center sales. In 2024, the company acquired ZT Systems for around $5 billion. The ZT Systems purchase will further help Advanced Micro Devices in improving its market share in AI data centers. During the third quarter of 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) posted a revenue of $6.82 billion, up by 18% year-over-year and beating estimates by $104.33 million. The data center revenue accounted for $3.5 billion, up 122% year-over-year, driven by significant growth in EPYC CPU and Instinct GPU sales. On January 21, Citi maintained a Buy rating on AMD shares and lowered the price target from $200 to $175. The firm expects a drop in semiconductor sales due to weaker demand in PC, automotive, and industrial markets. However, analysts project AMD’s data center business to expand, driven by AI sales. Overall, AMD ranks 4th on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: DeepSeek's AI breakthrough is calling Big Tech's big spending into question

Big Tech’s multi-billion dollar spending on artificial intelligence will be under investor scrutiny this week — even more so after China’s DeepSeek sent shockwaves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley with a cheap yet competitive AI model. Ahead of earnings results from Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, the AI-driven stock rally lost $1 trillion in value after the Hangzhou-based AI startup demonstrated AI reasoning models on par with OpenAI and Anthropic. Last week’s release of DeepSeek-R1 sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks, with Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures all falling Monday morning. Nvidia (NVDA) stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. Investors were spooked by DeepSeek, which in December released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. According to the technical paper, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for training — much less than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. Meta (META), for example, used 16,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H100s to train its Llama 3 405B model. The tech giant and other U.S. rivals such as OpenAI have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips and AI infrastructure. Earlier this month, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company is planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure this year, and end up with more than 1.3 million GPUs. Meanwhile, OpenAI announced a new joint venture with tech heavyweights SoftBank (SFTBY) and Oracle (ORCL) to invest $500 billion in building new AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. DeepSeek’s seemingly efficient and competitive models could challenge Big Tech’s billions in spending on AI infrastructure — but it could also expand the market for AI. Despite questions over DeepSeek’s spending and distilled models, “there are a few clear breakthroughs which show the industry a path to cheaper means of both training and inference,” John Belton, a portfolio manager and analyst at Gabelli Funds, said in a statement shared with Quartz. Belton said DeepSeek’s methods raise questions of “great[er] innovation and therefore compute demand from Western customers,” who have more powerful chips than DeepSeek. Cheaper inferencing could expand the total-addressable-market, Belton said, as well as fulfill Jevon’s Paradox — the idea in economics that the more efficient it is to use a resource, the more likely consumption will increase. Meanwhile, cloud providers could see more demand as the cost of inferencing, or the process of a trained AI model making predictions from new data, declines — also a “definite positive” for AI developers such as Meta, Google (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), Belton said. While Jefferies (JEF)’ analyst said in a note that they “still think there will be a significant capex ramp for AI,” the cost of inferencing needs to scale down to reach mass AI adoption. It’s plausible the efficiency will lead to more demand for hardware to train proprietary models, Mark Klein, chief executive of SuRo Capital (SSSS), said in a statement shared with Quartz, but developers are still unsure how DeepSeek’s approach can scale with larger chip clusters. In the near term, AI-focused chip companies will be “unlikely to see meaningful change” in demand due to DeepSeek, considering supply constraints with chips, data center capacity, and power, analysts at William Blair said in a note. “Longer term, however, the continued pressure to lower the cost of compute—and the ability to reduce the cost of training and inference using new, more efficient algorithmic techniques—could result in lower capex than previously envisioned,” the analysts said. This could lessen Nvidia’s dominance, William Blair analysts said, especially if companies realize they don’t need large-scale chip clusters for frontier models. However, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said the world’s largest companies are not “going to use a Chinese start-up DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases.” “At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia,” Ives said in a statement shared with Quartz. “Launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing.....launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Jefferies analysts agreed that Nvidia will be OK. “They were overvalued anyway considering that we are only in first generation of this technology,” a Jefferies analyst said in a note. “Even with less demand for giant GPU data centers, the demand for inference machines will be off the charts.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Trump is turning the fate of TikTok into a public bidding war

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. President Donald Trump apparently has no qualms about turning the fate of TikTok into a public bidding war. When prompted by specific questions from reporters, the new president tossed out some of the biggest names in the tech world as possible buyers of TikTok’s US operations — a deal that would allow the platform to get around a ban imposed by Congress in the name of national security. Among the names floated so far by Trump are Elon Musk, owner of X; Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle (ORCL); and Microsoft (MSFT). It's not yet clear if any are involved in actual discussions. "I like bidding wars because you make your best deals," Trump said Monday as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One. Trump said he wants a deal done in 30 days. An executive order he signed on his first day in office actually gives TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, until April 4 to figure something out. Here is a closer look at the big names mentioned by Trump — and others who have also gone public with their bids: Microsoft, along with Walmart (WMT), made a failed bid for TikTok during Trump’s first term when Trump actually tried to ban the app. When asked Monday if Microsoft was among the companies interested this time around in an ownership stake, Trump answered in the affirmative: "I would say yes." It is not yet known whether Microsoft is actually involved in any talks. Microsoft’s prior bid in 2020 didn’t go anywhere. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later said after those discussions fell apart that the federal government had a "particular set of requirements and then it just disappeared." He called it the "strangest thing I've ever worked on." The Chinese government will certainly have a say in whatever happens. And government officials in that country, according to reports by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the social media app’s US business to Musk. Trump sounded intrigued by the idea when asked about it publicly. "I would be if he wanted to buy it," Trump said of Musk, the owner of X when a reporter at the White House wanted to know if he was in favor of such a deal. But Musk has not spoken on the subject yet, except to say on X, “I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change." Antitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users. Another factor in his favor is that Musk has a close relationship with the incoming president, having spent more than $250 million supporting his reelection campaign and as he is helping lead a government cost-cutting effort as part of a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He also runs an electric vehicle company, Tesla (TSLA), that has a factory in China and sells a lot of its cars to that part of the world. Trump has sent mixed signals about whether Ellison could play a role in the TikTok situation. "I’d like Larry to buy it too," the president said last week, with Ellison standing next to him at a press conference held to announce a new $500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure commitment. "Larry, let’s negotiate in front of the media,” Trump said, as SoftBank CEO Masa Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also looked on. "What I’m thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half, and we’ll give you the permit. And they’ll have a great partner, the United States." "Sounds like a good deal to me, Mr. President," Ellison said. NPR later reported that the Trump administration was developing a plan that would move control of TikTok to Oracle, where Ellison is chair and chief technology officer, along with other outside investors. In that scenario, ByteDance would keep a minority stake in the company while Oracle would oversee the app’s algorithm and data collection. Oracle already acts as a service provider for TikTok, storing its videos and other content in data centers. But Trump denied talks with Oracle when asked about the subject Sunday. "No, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days." He also denied any actual discussions with Ellison, saying "I never spoke to Larry about TikTok." Another bidder in the mix not yet mentioned by Trump is Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence startup backed by some Big Tech names: Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Nvidia (NVDA), and other venture capitalists. The AP reported this past weekend that Perplexity AI submitted a proposal to ByteDance that would merge Perplexity with TikTok’s US business and then give half ownership in that new company to the US government following an initial public offering. The AP also reported that TikTok’s US business would be merged with Perplexity AI without the platform’s proprietary algorithm, and the existing investors in ByteDance would receive equity in the new entity. One ByteDance board member, General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, told Axios last week during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that there could be a solution for TikTok that does not require a full divesture from ByteDance. General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), Sequoia Capital, and Susquehanna International Group are among the existing US investors in TikTok’s parent company. Former US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who acknowledged last year he was assembling a team of investors to buy TikTok, said last weekend on Fox News’s "Sunday Morning Futures" that a new investor would "dilute down" Chinese ownership of TikTok. "I’d be very interested in participating," he said. Another billionaire interested in a potential TikTok deal is Frank McCourt, the founder of the internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers. "There's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business," McCourt has told Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast. "We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it." His group includes "Shark Tank" star Kevin O’Leary, who has told Yahoo Finance that he, McCourt, and a consortium of business professionals are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a "legacy opportunity." The famed investor told Yahoo Finance that the group’s proposal excludes the platform’s algorithm. McCourt told Reuters last week at Davos that he is open to teaming up with other investors. O’Leary is also still interested, he told CNBC, but the law banning TikTok, which went into effect on Jan. 19, makes things more difficult. "I would love to do a deal if the law provided for it, but I don’t have the luxury of breaching the order of Congress," he said to CNBC. One other group of investors has publicly announced its interest in buying TikTok, and it claims to have an internet celebrity in its corner. It includes Jesse Tinsley, founder and CEO of Employer.com. The web celebrity is Jimmy Donaldson, the popular YouTuber better known as "MrBeast." The group submitted an all-cash bid, according to a release from Paul Hastings LLP, which said it is representing the investors. The Paul Hastings team includes Brad Bondi, brother of Pam Bondi, Trump’s pick to be attorney general of the US. Tinsley said on X that "our goal is to ensure TikTok stays accessible, thriving, and aligned with the values that make America great," he wrote. His group, he added, is "ready to structure the deal in whatever way President Trump and our government wish."

Title: Taiwan may offer help for industry over Trump tariff threats

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's government will soon look at whether it needs to help its domestic industry over threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to put tariffs on semiconductors, Premier Cho Jung-tai said on Wednesday. Home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the island is a key link in the global technology supply chain for companies such as Apple and Nvidia. Trump said on Monday he plans to impose tariffs on imported chips, pharmaceuticals and steel to get the producers to make them in the United States. Responding to a question on Trump's remarks, Cho said the economy ministry and other departments have been paying close attention to the "developments of the past few days". "In a day or two we will urgently look at whether we need to make more cooperative plans and future assistance programmes for the industrial sector," he added. "I would like to reassure our compatriots that Taiwan's position in the world's industrial chain is not to be ignored, and that we will continue to maintain such an advantage." Taiwan has to continue to strive for more cooperation externally and to maintain its leadership in the industrial and technological sectors, Cho added. In 2020, under the first Trump administration, TSMC announced that it would build a $12 billion factory in Arizona in a win for efforts by the U.S. government to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China. It later boosted those plans with the total investment now standing at $65 billion. TSMC has declined to comment on Trump's latest tariff remarks. This month, Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said he only expected a small impact from any tariffs imposed by Trump on semiconductor exports given their technological superiority. In another potential challenge for Taiwan, Trump last week directed federal agencies to investigate persistent U.S. trade deficits and unfair trade practices and alleged currency manipulation by other countries. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States surged 83% last year compared with 2023, with exports to the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors.

The White House is looking into national security concerns over Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek after its developer prompted a global tech sell-off. The National Security Council is reviewing the AI app’s potential national security implications, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing, according to Axios. Leavitt added that President Donald Trump sees the AI startup’s newly released AI models as a “wake-up call” for AI developers in the U.S., but that “we’ll restore American dominance.” Last week, Hangzhou-based AI startup DeepSeek introduced its first-generation, open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, that demonstrated comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models. The release prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks, with Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures all falling Monday morning. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) saw its stock plummet 17%, losing close to $600 billion in value — the largest single-day market cap loss ever for a U.S. company. Meanwhile, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store, while its site experienced outages from an influx of new users. DeepSeek also announced “large-scale malicious attacks” on Monday, forcing it to temporarily limit registrations. Investors were spooked by the Chinese startup, which released its DeepSeek-V3 model in December that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s more powerful chips. Leavitt also said the Biden administration “sat on its hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program,” according to Axios. During his final days in office, the former president introduced additional measures focused on curbing advanced chip exports to China. The new regulations reinforce and build upon previous U.S. export controls aimed at restricting China from certain semiconductors that can be used for AI and military development.

Most U.S. semiconductor ETFs focus on the same 30 semiconductor stocks, varying primarily in their ... [+] weighting methodologies. Semiconductor stocks outpaced the S&P 500 in 2024. The momentum will likely continue as global AI infrastructure spending keeps those chipmakers busy. The recently announced Stargate project funded by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX is an example. Stargate is slated to pour $500 billion into AI data centers over the next four years. Despite China's recent announcement about its DeepSeek technology, semiconductor stocks still have bright futures. A diversified semiconductor ETF is a smart choice if you are new to this space. Below, you will meet six high-performing semiconductor funds—one of which could fit nicely in your ETF portfolio. The universe of semiconductor ETFs is small. There are about two dozen of them in total. The list shrinks to about 10 when you exclude leveraged and inverse funds. Leverage funds use debt to amplify returns, but this also increases risk. Inverse funds produce the opposite return of an underlying index. So, if a semiconductor index rises 10%, the inverse ETF would lose 10%. Because leveraged and inverse funds are too risky for most investors, they are excluded from this list. The 10 remaining funds were sorted on their one-year total returns. Total return includes appreciation and dividends. None are dividend ETFs per se, but they do pay small yields. The list of 10 was then trimmed to the top six semiconductor ETFs, ordered from highest to lowest return. The table below introduces six semiconductor ETFs with total one-year returns ranging from 11.89% to 39.69%. Read on for an overview of each semiconductor fund. Metrics are current as of January 27 after close of trading. For more investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. SMH tracks the results of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor Index. The index and the fund include the 25 largest U.S. exchange-traded stocks that generate 50% or more of their revenues from semiconductors. The stocks are market-cap-weighted with a maximum weighting of 20%. VanEck's semiconductor ETF is the only pick on this list tracking the MVIS domestic semiconductor index. It is also the only fund that returned more than 30% to its shareholders over the last year. The secret is the aggressive weighting of Nvidia (NVDA) at 19.19% and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) at 12.96%. This one-two punch of semiconductor stocks has delivered huge gains over the past year, but the combination is risky. Nvidia is TSM's second-largest customer, so the companies' futures are linked. This ETF bets heavily that Nvidia and, by association, TSM will continue monetizing the AI buildout. If Nvidia stumbles, you might regret the fund's high concentration of those two stocks. The Columbia ETF is an actively managed fund that invests in semiconductor companies with promising, long-term growth potential. Selection factors include the quality of the management team and intellectual property. Stocks in the portfolio are weighted by conviction—so the highest-potential securities, as determined by fund manager analysis, are held in the largest quantities. The stocks in the SEMI portfolio are picked by humans who continually research and analyze the semiconductor space. Other ETFs on this list use an index to define their holdings. The human component creates the potential to beat index performance. The trade-off is a higher expense ratio since actively managed funds are more expensive to operate. Nvidia and Broadcom are the two largest holdings. Combined, they account for more than 40% of this fund's portfolio. To date, SEMI's returns have been competitive but not segment-leading. Strive's semiconductor ETF tracks the Bloomberg U.S. Listed Semiconductors Select Total Return Index. The index and fund include the top 30 semiconductor stocks weighted with a modified market cap formula. The maximum weighting is 22.5% and the cumulative weight of stocks comprising more than 4.5% of the index is capped at 45%. Strive's fund was launched in October 2022, making it the youngest fund on this list. It has the highest average annual return since inception, partially due to good timing. The fund launched just as tech stocks started rebounding from a tough 2022. SHOC has benefited from high concentrations in Nvidia and Broadcom. The fund currently holds these stocks at 20.02% and 17.57%, respectively. ASML Holding NV (ASML) is also a top holding at 8.98%. The remaining positions are weighted at 4.5% or lower. The SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF tracks an index of semiconductor stocks in the S&P Total Market Index. As of January 2025, there are 41 companies in the index and the fund, and individual weightings are capped at 4.5%. The SPDR semiconductor fund includes large, mid and small cap stocks using a modified equal-weighting system. With a larger portfolio and an exposure limit of 4.5% on any one security, XSD is the most balanced of the funds on this list. Broadcom is the largest holding at 3.93%, while Nvidia is the 12th largest position at 3.01%. This fund is a nice choice for investors who want diversified exposure to smaller semiconductor stocks such as Diodes Incorporated (DIOD) and Ambarella (AMBA). Invesco's original semiconductor ETF, PSI, tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex℠ Index. Intellidex indexes identify companies with high capital gains potential by analyzing price and earnings momentum, quality, management and value. The index and fund use a modified equal-weighting system so individual stock exposures have a limited range of 1.74% to 6.47%. PSI's modified equal-weighting system reduces over-concentration risk in mega-tech stocks Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO). Broadcom is the fund's top holding, weighted at 6.73%, and Nvidia is number five, weighted at 4.76%. This weighting system removes Nvidia's dominance and allows smaller companies more influence over the group's performance. PSI has delivered solid growth in the past year, without relying on one or two tickers. This fund is a good choice for investors wanting more balanced exposure to the semiconductor space. PHLX is Invesco's newer semiconductor ETF, launched in 2021. The fund tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, which includes the largest, U.S.-listed 30 semiconductor stocks. The stocks are weighted by market capitalization with some limitations. For example, the top three positions cannot exceed 12%, 10% and 8%, respectively. SOXQ has the lowest expense ratio and the second-highest dividend yield among the ETFs here. The fund's weighting system moderates over-concentration risk while allowing the big players some room to carry the portfolio's performance. SOXQ also includes 4.45% exposure to Taiwan Semiconductor, which is left out of several other funds. Most U.S. semiconductor ETFs focus on the same 30 semiconductor stocks, varying primarily in their weighting methodologies. Market-weighted funds depend on the biggest companies, while equal-weighted funds capture more growth from smaller companies. Your risk tolerance and investing philosophy can reveal which strategy suits you best. Do you believe in letting growth stocks run? If yes, then choose a market-weighted fund. If you worry that ever-rising stock prices may ultimately retreat, opt for equal weighting. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: DeepSeek Is Causing Stock Market Panic. Here's Why It Matters.

Senior Reporter, Work/Life If you follow the stock market, then you know all about the bogeyman scaring Wall Street right now: DeepSeek. The Chinese ChatGPT competitor is currently the top-downloaded productivity app in the U.S. Apple app store. DeepSeek’s newest open-source model, R1, was released last week, and it is wowing the AI industry because it reportedly has advanced capabilities for a fraction of the price ― and without needing the same energy ― as U.S. companies like OpenAI and Google. On Monday, Nvidia ― which largely makes the highly specialized, expensive chips that are powering the U.S. AI boom ― saw its shares plunge 17% in response to the news about DeepSeek’s AI model, causing the company to lose almost $600 billion in market value. It was the biggest one-day loss ever for a public company. Other AI-related stocks, including Broadcom, also saw their stocks slump by over 10% yesterday. In other words, a huge sell-off of stock just happened. This drop reflects “a sharp pullback in price because of an abundance of sellers,” explained Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. “Stock prices are a reflection of future corporate earnings expectations. Anything that changes the assumptions in those earnings expectations can lead to a sharp correction in price,” he said. “In technology, the ever-present risk is that a competitor will come along with a better, cheaper or more efficient mousetrap and pose a threat to future earnings. When this happens, investors tend to sell first and ask questions later.” Many investors are clearly panicking and making bets on the future of AI, but should you? HuffPost asked financial experts about what, if anything, you should be doing with your money ― regardless of what you have invested. Some people are wondering if the sell-off of Nvidia (NVDA) stock makes it actually a good time to buy Nvidia stock, but financial experts advise against making any sudden changes. “You should never respond to one-off changes in the stock market, and you should not be investing in individual stocks or worried about the changes in individual stocks,” warned University of Houston economist Dietrich Vollrath. “You should, as always, be invested in broad index funds with the lowest possible expense ratios.“ It’s easy to get swept up in the success stories of individual stocks paying off loans or houses, but here are some sobering facts: Only about 1% of investors are successful at timing the stock market. Remember GameStop’s quick rise and fall? YouTuber David Dobrik said he lost $85,000 investing in GameStop during its short-lived hype. Ideally, you should diversify your investments so one stock’s financial losses do not crater or compound your own. “Investors should aim at having a diversified portfolio and are usually better off not trying to time the market,” Gil Luria, head of technology research for financial services firm D.A. Davidson, said Tuesday. “NVDA shares declined yesterday because there are new concerns regarding their ability to continue to grow at the same rate as the last couple of years.” And if you did invest solely in AI chip makers, use this stinging loss as your sign to spread your money around. “Yesterday’s market moves also underscore the risks of being too heavily concentrated in a narrow sector of the market,” McBride said. “If you have too much of your wealth tied up in a handful of closely related stocks, it serves as a wake-up call to spread the money out and cushion against a sudden downdraft.” Before you invest your housing payment in risky stocks, follow this basic financial advice: Make sure you have money set aside in your emergency savings, which ideally is three to six months of after-tax living expenses, so you always have money to fall back on. And do make clear financial goals, such as saving for retirement, so that your investment decisions are aligned with your risk appetite. Although AI chip makers had a bad day Monday on Wall Street, they are already beginning to bounce back a day later. Instead of being reactive to the stock market going up or down a lot in one day, look at the big picture. “Looking at trends over several years provides a more accurate picture, as markets can experience significant volatility within a single year. Over time, markets have a way of balancing out,” said Ramona Ortega, CEO and founder of WealthBuild, an AI-powered financial assistant. “There’s no exact timeline for when corrections will occur, but history shows they always do.” Vollrath said what happened to Nvidia is a “reminder that the economy is not the stock market. This means essentially nothing for the economy, in terms of economic growth, interest rates or employment.“ Is Monday’s chip-maker sell-off an overreaction, or is DeepSeek’s low-cost breakthrough a fundamental shift to where the AI market is heading? It’s too soon to tell whether this will have larger repercussions for AI jobs and consumer spending, experts say. The next four years will change America forever.
