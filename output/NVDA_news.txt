Title: Nvidia Reports Earnings Next Week. How Big of a Blowout Will It Be?
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/11/14/nvidia-reports-earnings-next-week-how-big-of-a-blowout-will-it-be/

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Monster Ztudio / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, powering data centers and enabling breakthroughs in generative AI. Over the past few years, the company has transformed from a graphics specialist into a tech powerhouse, with its stock surging amid the AI boom. Over the past five years, Nvidia has beaten Wall Street’s earnings estimates 90% of the time, sometimes by more than 30%, showcasing consistent outperformance. In the last four quarters, however, the chipmaker has averaged a beat of only 6.5%, likely due to analysts getting better at predicting its results. Investors are now laser-focused on Nvidia’s upcoming third-quarter results, set for release after market close on Nov. 19. Expectations run high, with Wall Street forecasting $54.83 billion in revenue and $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share — up 56% and 54% year-over-year, respectively. This pressure mounts as “whisper numbers,” the unofficial higher estimates circulating among traders, suggest Nvidia must deliver an even bigger surprise to avoid disappointing the market. Any miss could trigger a selloff, especially given its role as a bellwether for the broader AI sector. Nvidia’s success in the recent quarter likely stems from its commanding position in the AI ecosystem. As the primary supplier of GPUs for training large language models, the company has capitalized on demand from hyperscalers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In the prior quarter, data center revenue hit record levels, driven by Blackwell chip ramp-ups and partnerships with AI innovators. These factors could push Q3 revenue toward or beyond the guided $54 billion, with analysts projecting 54% growth. On the bottom line, improved margins from economies of scale and software integrations, such as CUDA, may boost adjusted earnings to around $1.25 per share. Beyond hardware, Nvidia’s Omniverse platform for simulations has gained traction in industries like automotive and robotics, adding diversified revenue streams. Recent wins include expanded deals with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for cloud AI infrastructure, potentially contributing millions in incremental sales. Overall, these tailwinds position Nvidia for another strong showing, reinforcing its market cap lead on the S&P 500. Despite the momentum, setbacks could temper results. Nvidia faces ongoing restrictions on its ability to sell advanced AI chips to China. This “hangover” persists, with no H20 chip revenue in Q3, as CEO Jensen Huang recently confirmed, and no expectation for that to change. While the company still sells less advanced tech, such as gaming and automotive chips, to Chinese customers, the loss of high-margin data center business — previously a key growth driver — may cap upside. Analysts estimate this could shave several billion off potential revenue. Additionally, hedge fund manager Michael Burry’s bearish put options on Nvidia, revealed last week, sparked a 7.2% stock drop, signaling concerns over AI hype and valuation risks (Burry just announced he was closing his Scion fund and returning investor funds because he no longer understood AI market valuations). Broader market dynamics, including competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and a coming cash crunch, add uncertainty. If demand softens or supply chain issues arise, these could pressure margins and lead to a guidance miss for Q4, where Wall Street expects $61.33 billion in revenue. Nvidia’s earnings next week could indeed be a blowout, given its 90.5% beat rate over the last 21 quarters and robust AI demand. However, smaller recent beats and China restrictions raise the chance of a negative surprise if results fall short of whisper numbers or its guidance disappoints. In the last three earnings announcements in February, May, and August, Nvidia’s stock has briefly declined twice afterward, underscoring potential post-report volatility. Long-term investors might buy before results if they are confident in Nvidia’s fundamentals — which otherwise seem solid — but risk-averse ones might wait for clarity on guidance. The chipmaker’s stock is down 12% from its all-time hit above $212 at the end of October, and its shares have fallen in the past few sessions. CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) just shocked the market with news of a data center partner’s buildout delay and we may see other AI stocks run into similar situations as the race for scarce resources heats up. The prudent choice just might be to take a wait-and-see approach before diving in.

The stock market cleared a major hurdle this week. It's the outset of what is historically a good time for equities. You wouldn't know it if you looked at your portfolio today. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed legislation to reopen the federal government, ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The reopening removes the economic drag from more than 1 million federal workers going without pay and clears a path for federal agencies to once again release vital economic data. Yet stocks were falling Thursday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which finished the day down more than 2%—perhaps a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event, since stocks rallied on Monday as an end to the shutdown looked imminent. AI optimism and expectations for rate cuts have been two of the primary drivers of stock returns this year. If either AI or the Federal Reserve fail to meet Wall Street's expectations, stocks may be vulnerable to correction. Historically, the end of a shutdown has supported stocks, according to Adam Turnquist, Chief Technical Strategist at LPL Financial. Since 1976, he wrote Wednesday, covering 20 shutdowns, the S&P 500 has risen more in the one- and three-month periods after a budget resolution than in all other comparable periods. This shutdown is also ending at a time of year that’s historically good for the stock market. Since 2000, November has, on average, been the best month of the year for the S&P 500. December, another positive month, is more often than not capped off with a Santa Claus rally. But the mood on Wall Street heading into the end of the year appears more dour than rosy, with investors debating the existence of an AI bubble and uncertain what incoming economic data will say about the health of the economy. The debate about an AI bubble has taken a toll on tech stocks in recent weeks. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) slid 7% last week, and were down more than 3.5% on Thursday. Palantir (PLTR) stock tumbled 8% the day after it posted earnings that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. On Thursday, the majority of the S&P 500’s worst-performing stocks were high-flying AI beneficiaries like software firm Applovin (APP) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO). AI bubble concerns are being fueled by soaring valuations in both public and private markets. OpenAI, which doesn't expect to turn a profit until 2029, is valued at $500 billion. Palantir, even with its recent pullback, trades at about 240 times forward earnings. The chasm between AI spending and AI revenue has also raised eyebrows. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) intend to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build data centers and fill them with AI-enabling equipment. They have had some success showing investors that AI is contributing to their top and bottom lines, but some investors are turning skeptical. Wall Street has also taken note of a shift in how AI investments are funded. Up to this point, tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon have mostly relied on cash flows to build data centers and buy chips. Proponents of the AI bubble narrative have frequently pointed to the size and stability of these cash flows to argue for the AI boom’s sustainability. Investors will also be watching economic data heading into the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting of the year next month. Inflation and labor market reports were delayed by the shutdown, denying Wall Street and the Fed vital economic temperature checks. And, despite the end of the shutdown, investors aren’t sure when they’ll get that data, if at all. The White House on Wednesday suggested inflation and labor market data for October may never be released, which would leave policymakers to lean on other public and private datasets as they deliberate whether to cut interest rates for a third time this year in mid-December. Officials are divided on how to proceed. Some have urged caution, citing concerns that inflation, which has reaccelerated this year, could stick above their 2% target. The data blackout has given inflation-wary officials even more reason to argue for slower cuts. Meanwhile, recent private sector data suggests that labor market conditions have deteriorated more than expected this year, giving dovish officials fodder to argue for more aggressive cuts. Wall Street increasingly believes the hawks, who favor higher rates, have the upper hand. Federal funds futures trading data on Thursday put the odds of a December rate cut at 47%, down from 96% a month ago and 63% yesterday.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images News via Getty Images Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement last week. She has been a leading voice in Congress for decades, and her term will end in January 2027. She’s currently holding on to many stocks, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) being the latest buys. Pelosi hasn’t been without controversy, with stock trading being one of the biggest concerns of her critics. It should be noted that Nancy Pelosi’s stock trades are not directly hers. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, is the person buying and selling stocks, though these trades are still attributed to her, as she is likely legally entitled to a significant portion of them, upon a possible divorce or her husband’s passing. At the same time, there are concerns that Nancy Pelosi will be passing information to her husband. These claims are not proven. But what is proven is that the Pelosis have had remarkable wins over the course of their investing history. Since mid-2014, her strategy has yielded her 858.58% in gains, whereas the S&P 500 only returned 263.2%. This is a 595% outperformance over the S&P 500. Let’s take a look at the three stocks she holds now. Nvidia is Pelosi’s biggest holding, with 20% of her portfolio being in this one stock. Her latest trade was on January 14, 2025, and was disclosed on January 17. She purchased 50 call options with a strike price of $80 and an expiration date of January 16, 2026. Since that trade, NVDA stock is up 47.09%. If the options were to be exercised today, she would have a total of $569,000 in NVDA stock. To find the true profits, you’d have to exclude the premium paid for all these options, the exact amount of which is not known. Alphabet is her second-biggest holding, with 15% of her portfolio in GOOGL stock. Her latest transaction was on January 14, 2025, and was filed three days later on January 17. She bought 50 call options on GOOGL stock, with each option representing 100 shares. This has been a very profitable buy, with GOOGL stock up more than 46% since that transaction took place. Since these are options, Pelosi will be able to exercise 5,000 shares of GOOGL at the strike price of $150. If these options were to be exercised today, she would have $683,550 in GOOGL stock. This is a well-timed trade, and Pelosi is very likely to exercise these options by the time they expire and then hold GOOGL stock directly. Broadcom also has the same weight as Alphabet at 15%. Her most recent AVGO trade happened on June 20, 2025, and it was disclosed on July 9. She exercised 20 call options that were purchased on June 24, 2024 (20,000 shares post-split). President Donald Trump announced a $70 billion investment in AI and energy, less than a month after Pelosi exercised those options. AVGO stock is up 42.09% since the call options were exercised, but her initial call options trade made even more money. Pelosi bought 20 call options on AVGO with an $800 strike price and an expiry of June 20, 2025. This was three weeks before AVGO went through a 10-for-1 stock split. AVGO stock gained over 50% from June 24, 2024, to June 20, 2025.

Title: Nvidia's Earnings Are Almost Here. Investors Are Already Worried About the AI Rally.

Nvidia is slated to report quarterly results next Wednesday. It could be a make-or-break moment for the bull market. Anxiety about AI is running high on Wall Street heading into Nvidia's (NVDA) print. AI stocks weighed on the broader market last week, when the Nasdaq notched its worst weekly performance since early April’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement roiled markets. The mood improved to start the week amid signs that the government was moving closer to reopening. But AI jitters returned after Japanese investment firm SoftBank on Tuesday said it had sold its entire stake in Nvidia: Shares of both companies slumped despite SoftBank executives clarifying that the sale was made to fund other AI investments, not a sign that the company had soured on the chipmaker. Nvidia's quarterly earnings report is one of the most closely followed events on Wall Street. Investors parse Nvidia's results and guidance for confirmation that the AI infrastructure buildout, which made the chipmaker the world's most valuable company and has help power partners' and competitors' shares higher, is continuing. Some investors are increasingly concerned that an AI bubble is forming, fueled by a series of circular business deals, massive AI investments, and optimism about the technology’s near-term commercial utility. Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, recently revealed his hedge fund had shorted $1.2 billion of Nvidia and Palantir (PLTR) stock as of the end of September. The major hyperscalers—tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year and next as they construct data centers and outfit them with the advanced chips and support equipment required the train and run artificial intelligence. That spending has been a boon to companies like Nvidia, whose sales and earnings have soared over the past three years. But some investors question whether the hyperscalers would recoup their investments. BCA Research analysts last week suggested shorting hyperscaler stocks, citing their belief that the speed and scale of AI investments will weigh the companies' returns on equity, and thus their stock valuations, regardless of profit growth in their core businesses. “Our biggest fear would be a repeat of the telecom and fiber buildout experiences, where the revenue curve failed to materialize at a pace that justified continued investment,” wrote JPMorgan analysts on Wednesday. JPMorgan estimated that it would require about $650 billion of annual revenue indefinitely for tech companies to reap a 10% return on their AI investments through 2030. For scale, they likened that figure to nearly six basis points of global gross domestic product or nearly $35 a month from every current iPhone user. The growing importance of OpenAI to the rally has also raised eyebrows. According to CEO Sam Altman, the start-up recently reached an annualized revenue run rate of $20 billion. But JPMorgan estimates the ChatGPT maker has agreed to pay just three companies—Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO)—between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion for data center capacity over the next 5 years. To be sure, many investors see ample reason to remain bullish on AI stocks—or, at least, that it's too hard to call the top to bet against them. They note that comparisons of today to the Dotcom Bubble ignore that tech valuations are below their Dotcom peaks, and that, unlike during the 1990s internet craze, the companies making the biggest investments in AI infrastructure are among the world's largest most profitable companies. Others point to the likelihood that the Federal Reserve is in the middle of a rate-cutting cycle, which should stimulate data center construction by making borrowing more affordable. Rate cuts are also expected to increase liquidity in financial markets, likely boosting stock prices. AI excitement can still send a stock soaring despite the skeptics. Chipmaker AMD on Tuesday said it expects the AI chip market to reach $1 trillion by 2030, and that it is aiming to grow its share of that market to double digits. Oppenheimer analysts in a note on Wednesday called the updates "more sizzle than steak," and lamented the absence of a major customer announcement. Still, the projections caught the attention of investors. AMD shares finished today up more than 8%.

November 12, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: NetworkNewsWire NetworkNewsWire This article has been disseminated on behalf of ESGold Corp., which may include a paid advertisement. AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NetworkNewsWire Editorial Coverage: Artificial intelligence may be driven by algorithms and code, but its hardware backbone depends on gold and silver — the same precious metals that connect every chip, circuit board and data hub worldwide. Global reserves of these materials are tightening even as industrial demand accelerates, creating a structural imbalance few foresaw. Silver remains unmatched as the essential conductor embedded in photovoltaic cells and high-speed electronic networks, while gold continues to serve as the corrosion-resistant benchmark for bonding wires, connectors and precision components. According to the World Gold Council, technology demand for gold reached approximately 326 tonnes last year, a 7% year-over-year increase, translating to more than 10.5 million ounces consumed across electronics and industrial applications. As AI infrastructure expands worldwide, that appetite for conductive metals is projected to rise sharply. Positioned to meet this growing need, ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (Profile) is advancing a fully funded, fully permitted gold-silver project engineered for near-term production and sustained growth. The company is working to align itself with the evolving ecosystem of producers and end users powering the next industrial transformation, including industry leaders such as Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM). Disclosure: This does not represent material news, partnerships, or investment advice. Click here to view the custom infographic of the ESGold Corp. editorial. AI Boom Turns Metals into New Bottleneck As the digital economy expands, the constraint is no longer software innovation but the physical supply of metals that makes modern intelligence possible. According to Goldman Sachs Research, electricity consumption from data centers is projected to surge by up to 165% by 2030 compared with 2023 levels, driven by the rapid construction of AI-optimized, high-density facilities. This explosive scale-up is cascading through supply chains. Every new server, accelerator and switch relies on gold-plated connectors and silver-rich solders, components whose durability and conductivity depend on these metals’ unique characteristics. The result is not a minor adjustment but a full-scale infrastructure transformation that pushes materials from background costs to headline risks. When supply tightens, manufacturing cannot wait. Production lines must continue, forcing technology companies to pay premiums to secure critical inputs. The signs of strain are already visible. Utilities across the United States are revising capacity plans around surging AI-driven electricity demand, while analysts warn that global data center consumption could more than double by 2030. In the spot market, stress has flared as well: in October 2025, Reuters reported a silver shortage in London significant enough to require airlifting bars, sending lease rates sharply higher before stabilizing. For manufacturers, these developments mean urgency, not choice; when gold-plated contacts and silver-bearing solders are essential, there is no substitute. Electronics and renewable energy sectors are compounding the draw. The World Gold Council reports that technology demand for gold rose to 326 tonnes in 2024, equivalent to roughly 10.5 million ounces, while the Silver Institute logged industrial silver demand at a record 680.5 million ounces, marking the fourth consecutive year of structural deficit. Even smartphones are a steady source of consumption: Each device contains around 7 to 34 milligrams of gold, and with roughly 1.4 billion units produced annually, they represent a consistent, noncyclical sink before factoring in PCs, servers and networking equipment. The outcome is a tightening materials stack that increasingly dictates the pace and cost of AI, EV and solar deployment. Clean, Construction-Ready Supply on Track In this tightening landscape, ESGold is positioning its flagship Montauban Gold-Silver Project to deliver near-term, clean metal supply without the long permitting timelines or financing gaps that delay many mining ventures. The Québec-based project is fully permitted and fully funded through construction, which is slated for completion in late 2025, with first production anticipated in 2026. For investors, that combination of capital security, regulatory clearance and visible progress eliminates many of the standard risks that hinder development-stage projects. ESGold’s strategy centers on reprocessing historical tailings instead of pursuing a traditional greenfield mine build. By leveraging existing, mined material and a proven, environmentally responsible processing circuit, the company aims to accelerate its path to cash flow while preserving upside for broader district exploration. Company updates have detailed ongoing installation and commissioning of a Merrill-Crowe recovery system, alongside an on-site lab and gold room, all tangible milestones that mark the transition from planning to production readiness. Funding stability remains a cornerstone of ESGold’s story. A September 2025 update confirmed full financing to complete Montauban’s buildout and advance a parallel validation initiative in Colombia. In a market where many junior miners struggle for capital, a clear route to commissioning is a strategic advantage, particularly as industrial and technology players grow more attuned to materials security and reliable supply. Turning Waste into Value and Growth ESGold’s business model reverses the traditional mining playbook. Instead of requiring years of exploration and heavy upfront spending, it generates early revenue by reprocessing tailings — monetizing material already extracted — while contributing to environmental restoration. The company’s updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) outlines compelling economics, including an after-tax internal rate of return of about 60%, a payback period of less than two years, and an after-tax net present value above C$24 million at a 5% discount rate based on stated recovery and pricing assumptions. While PEAs are inherently preliminary, these figures depict a fast-cycling project capable of reinvesting capital into expansion and exploration. That pace matters in today’s market, where hardware manufacturers and energy developers face extended supply lead times. Bringing additional gold and silver to market by 2026 positions ESGold ahead of slower-moving peers. Self-funded growth also offers flexibility: Revenues from tailings can support step-out drilling or modular capacity increases with less dilution, strengthening long-term project resilience. Tailings reprocessing aligns neatly with modern environmental and supply chain priorities. Recovering metals from previously mined material reduces permitting complexity, minimizes new waste, and produces clean, saleable metal, all attributes increasingly valued by downstream buyers. As technology and renewable energy companies tighten ESG procurement standards, the intersection of early cash flow and responsible production widens ESGold’s potential offtake opportunities. Scalable Growth in a Supply-Constrained Market By working with known, high-grade tailings rather than exploring from scratch, ESGold eliminates much of the uncertainty that typically accompanies early-stage projects while maintaining upside for discovery across the Montauban district. The company’s steady construction progress on a fully permitted, fully financed project stands out in a preproduction sector where many competitors remain years away from revenue. Scalability is central to ESGold’s long-term vision. Tailings reprocessing is modular by design; it can be replicated efficiently across other regions once technical processes are validated. ESGold has indicated its intention to expand this “tailings-to-cash-flow” model throughout the Americas, layering in throughput and revenue while keeping risk manageable. This approach appeals to both end users, who seek diversified, verifiable metal sources, and financiers, who value repeatable, low-capex unit economics. Market conditions reinforce the opportunity. Industrial silver demand hit 680.5 million ounces in 2024, its highest level on record, while the global market ran a fourth consecutive deficit. For gold, the World Gold Council attributes technology-related growth to AI and electronics. In such an environment, near-term producers with proven funding and infrastructure readiness can capture premium pricing and preferred offtake relationships while others remain in development limbo. Expanding Discovery Across Montauban Alongside construction, ESGold is advancing exploration across the Montauban district. The company reports that its 3D geological modeling program is nearly complete, integrating historic and geophysical data to pinpoint deeper, previously untapped structures. Technical studies indicate continuous geological formations extending to about 1,200 meters, suggesting the potential for large-scale mineralization beyond the tailings resource. Earlier updates cited passive seismic imaging as a key tool refining Montauban’s structural understanding. The intent is to evolve from a single-site reprocessing project into a multifeed “hub and spoke” operation sourcing material from both tailings and new discoveries. ESGold’s parallel progress on permitting ensures drilling can begin swiftly once exploration targets are finalized, maintaining operational momentum. This dual-track approach — producing revenue while pursuing exploration — sets ESGold apart from peers that must choose between near-term cash flow and long-term upside. The Montauban project seeks to deliver both: immediate production from tailings and the potential for district-scale expansion. Even if only a portion of these deeper zones convert to defined resources, ESGold’s growth runway could extend well beyond its initial operating phase. This balance, near-term production with concurrent exploration, differentiates ESGold from juniors locked into long-dated builds. Investors are often forced to choose between cash flow and blue-sky upside. Montauban aims to deliver both, sequencing revenue first and then targeting scale. If even part of the deeper target set converts into resources, the platform for a multiyear district story strengthens. If not, the base case remains a permitted, funded operation monetizing tailings in a tight metals market. Ready Supply in Tightening Market Scarcity creates opportunity. With AI infrastructure, EV production and solar deployment all intensifying demand for precious metals, supply constraints are moving from a background concern to a central business risk for manufacturers. The Silver Institute’s data confirming consecutive structural deficits, along with spot-market disruptions such as the recent London squeeze, illustrate how quickly inventory stress can surface when industrial and investor demand converge. For producers capable of adding new metal supply with low capital costs and rapid paybacks, these market dynamics favor revaluation as production nears. Few preproduction companies can credibly claim to be both fully permitted and fully funded while advancing construction on schedule. ESGold’s PEA projects a roughly 60% after-tax internal rate of return and a payback under two years, underscoring the project’s efficiency. As AI and renewable infrastructure expand globally, the material bottleneck is becoming a defining theme, and ESGold is positioned to address it directly. The broader narrative returns to the core thesis: AI, electrification and renewable energy are as much materials revolutions as they are technological ones. Gold and silver are not merely safe-haven assets; they are essential building blocks of digital and clean energy ecosystems. As industrial demand rises and new mine development remains slow, investors are increasingly drawn to companies that can provide dependable near-term supply while maintaining exploration upside. ESGold belongs to this select group. With its Montauban Gold-Silver Project fully financed, fully permitted, and advancing toward production in 2026, the company offers both stability and scalability. Ongoing exploration adds long-term potential, creating a balanced opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the metals that underpin the next generation of technology and energy infrastructure. AI Expansion Accelerates as Global Leaders Invest in Next-Gen Infrastructure AI continues to reshape the global economy, driving unprecedented investment in data infrastructure, computing power and next-generation manufacturing. Around the world, leading innovators are unveiling ambitious projects that fuse advanced hardware, cloud computing and automation to support the explosive growth of AI. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) announced that El Paso, Texas, will be home to the company’s next state-of-the-art data center, its 25th in the United States and 29th in the world. This almost 1.2 million-square-foot campus will be optimized for Meta’s AI workloads as part of the highly advanced infrastructure that helps connect billions of people around the world and will have the ability to scale to 1GW. Once completed, the El Paso Data Center will represent an investment of more than $1.5 billion and support approximately 100 jobs. The company anticipates that more than 1,800 construction workers will be onsite at the peak of construction. Tesla Inc.
