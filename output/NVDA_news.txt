We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Driven mostly by Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Japanese producer Ibiden is looking at methods to boost manufacturing capacity to satisfy rising demand for chip substrates vital for artificial intelligence computers. CEO Koji Kawashima made the statement while in an interview with Bloomberg. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Based in Ogaki, Japan, Ibiden provides specialized substratesincluding powerful graphics processing units from Nvidiathat are vital for producing artificial intelligence chips. Strong orders have driven the business to investigate capacity increases because, according to Kawashima, demand is projected to stay high until next year. Ibiden is building a new manufacturing site in Gifu Prefecture to handle these demands. By late 2025 the plant will start running at 25% capacity; by early 2026 it will rise to 50%. Talks on complete operating capability to satisfy consumer expectations are still under progress. Kawashima underlined the need of increasing output to maintain customer satisfaction and said that customers had already asked about next projects. Although Nvidia continues to be a major client, Ibiden has broadened its portfolio of business to include firms engaged in advanced computing technology. Once the biggest source of income for Ibiden, Intel now accounts for less of revenues. While stressing the need of lowering dependence on any one customer, Kawashima pointed out the historical significance of the link with Intel. Though rising sales of AI-specific devices, Ibiden recently changed its profit projection due to declining demand for server-related components in non-AI applications. Kawashima voiced hope for overcoming these obstacles by means of strategic alliances and creativity. Citing logistical and labor cost issues, the corporation has decided against building manufacturing plants located in the United States. As competition in the AI chip industry rises, Ibiden expects to be offering a wider spectrum of customers ahead. From established companies like Nvidia to startups with unique silicon designs, Kawashima pointed out the company's flexibility in fulfilling changing market demands.

Title: NVIDIA Partner Super Micro Ends $50 Million Loan, Shares Fall

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI, Financials) ended a $50 million loan deal with HSBC's Taiwan unit, therefore creating even another level of financial difficulties for its operations. The business said that formally the loan, completely repaid on Sept. 9, was ended on Dec. 20. Reflecting investor uncertainty, Super Micro's shares fell 5% on the announcement. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Previously called the General Loan, Export/Import Financing, Overdraft Facilities, and Securities deal, the terminated deal provided credit to Super Micro's Taiwan affiliate. The company's future liquidity management comes under scrutiny as it has not stated intentions for a successor financing strategy. Amid these developments, Super Micro Computer keeps working with NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA, Financials) to improve its position in the artificial intelligence sector while handling continuous financial review. Emphasizing its dedication to improving artificial intelligence technology, the business has revealed three NVIDIA-powered generative AI SuperClusters, aiming at corporate and big language model applications. Announced earlier this year, the SuperClusters seek to clear key AI process bottlenecks like GPU memory capacity and efficiency. The development emphasizes Super Micro's strategic dependence on NVIDIA technology to support its AI offers, a move experts see as essential to maintain its competitiveness in the fast changing tech scene. Super Micro struggles financially, however. The firm postponed publishing its annual report in August, under investigation by short-seller Hindenburg Research for claimed possible accounting mistakes. October saw an escalation in the matter as Ernst & Young left their post as auditor due to internal control issues. Super Micro hired BDO USA as its new auditor to handle these issues and submitted a compliance plan to Nasdaq, which gave the business an extension until February 2025 to record missing reports.

Title: Nvidia may be entering a 'limitless' era: Investor

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia's (NVDA) Teflon-like stock may be taking a few swipes as the year winds down, but a new chapter awaits the AI market darling — and with it more impressive quarters of growth, experts and investors believe. "Nvidia is printing money like Apple did in the early days of the iPhone," Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management president Ross Gerber said on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts (video above), later adding, "the opportunity for AI is somewhat limitless at this point." Gerber, who has been an investor in Nvidia for the past decade after it rose to popularity for its high-performance gaming chips, thinks the company is entering its "next leg" of growth. The growth is to be fueled by rapid global buildouts of artificial intelligence infrastructure, powered in large part by Nvidia's leading-edge chips. "Nvidia is not a highly expensive stock, but it's not a cheap stock," Gerber said. "But the actual profits that they're driving and their monopoly position in the chip business just puts the next five years looking really good for Nvidia." "I certainly wouldn't get off it now," he added. "So for investors, Nvidia needs to be a part of your portfolio just as much as Apple and Microsoft." The excitement around what lies ahead for Nvidia is captured in retail investor inflows. Nvidia has attracted $30 billion in retail investor inflows so far this year, according to data from Vanda Research. It makes Nvidia the most popular stock among retail investors in 2024, ahead of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), with $15.3 billion in inflows, and Tesla (TSLA), with $14.7 billion. Some traders have opted to get off the Nvidia rocket ship this month, however. Shares of the new Dow Jones Industrial Average component are up just 0.7% in the past month. The Dow is down 10% in the last month, while the S&P 500 has lost about 1.7%. Nvidia shares are still higher by 181% year to date. The stock is facing a soul-searching moment, according to Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya. This is related to several factors, including execution issues while trying to push through leading innovation and concerns around China exposure ahead of potential tariffs from returning president Trump. “Some of these [issues] are company-specific forces,” Arya said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (listen below), “and some of these are market forces.” The switch to Nvidia's Blackwell AI chip — which won Yahoo Finance's 2024 Product of the Year award — hasn't been seamless, Arya explained, and this has unnerved the bulls. “The last two quarters have not been clean because they are going through the growing pains from one generation of product to a new generation,” Arya said. Blackwell, which the company rolled out in March at its annual GPU conference, was hailed as Nvidia’s most powerful and innovative offering. However, bringing the completed idea in the form of a product to the masses has proven itself to be more difficult. “Since [March], what we have seen is execution issues keeping it out of the hands of customers,” he said. Now Wall Street's gaze will shift to success toward unleashing Blackwell into a market that is hungry for its offerings. Arya believes that Blackwell will rack up billions in sales in 2025. The stock could also see a near-term catalyst as Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage as a keynote speaker at CES 2025 in early January. Yahoo Finance data shows that sell-side analysts expect Nvidia to increase net sales by $65 billion year over year in 2025, with earnings per share more than doubling. "They're the only game in town," Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said on Opening Bid. The [AI] foundation starts with Nvidia. That is not changing." Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The Dow dropped over 400 points on Monday as lighter trading volumes were anticipated in the final days of 2024. The market experienced a wave of profit-taking, especially in the technology sector. By the end of the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 418 points, or 0.97%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NDAQ-0.18%) Composite fell 1% each, reflecting broad-based weakness across key indices. Please note that the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will suspend trading on Thursday, January 9, in observance of a National Day of Mourning following the passing of former President Jimmy Carter.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks fell on Monday, with the woes of the three major indexes continuing in the final week of the year as an otherwise strong 2024 comes to a close. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped about 1.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid roughly 1.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off more than 1.6%. Stocks' move lower came as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) retreated from a seven-month high to hover near 4.56%. Stocks closed out last week with a Friday slide from Big Tech names like Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA), with the Nasdaq Composite falling 1.5% and the S&P 500 down over 1%. The highly anticipated "Santa Claus" rally, which is statistically one of the most consistent seven-day positive stretches of the year for the S&P 500, has been a flop thus far. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has risen 1.3% during the seven trading days beginning Dec. 24, well above the typical seven-day average of 0.3%, according to LPL Financial chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist. In the current period, the S&P 500 is down less than 0.1%. With just two days of trading left in 2024, markets are hoping to recapture the momentum of this year's gains. The benchmark S&P is up over 25% in 2024, while the Nasdaq has increased over 30%. The blue-chip Dow has risen a more modest 14%. In a separate development, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq announced trading will be closed on Thursday Jan. 9 in a day of mourning for Former President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100 at his home in Plains, Georgia. Former President Jimmy Carter died Sunday at the age of 100 at his home in Plains, Georgia, the Carter Center said. On Monday, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq announced trading will be closed on Thursday Jan. 9 in observance of the National Day of Mourning. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Housing contract activity picked up again in November as buyers shrugged off elevated mortgage rates and took advantage of higher inventory levels. The Pending Home Sales Index, which tracks contract signings on existing homes, rose 2.2% from October to 79, its highest reading since February 2023, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). An index level of 100 is equal to contract activity in 2001. It’s the fourth straight month of gains. Pending home sales are up 6.9% compared to November 2023. “Consumers appeared to have recalibrated expectations regarding mortgage rates and are taking advantage of more available inventory,” Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, said in a statement. All 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were in the red at the open on Monday. The Information Technology sector (XLK), a key driver of the 2024 stock market rally, was off about 1.8% leading the losses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were all of more than 1% to start the trading session. Futures are pointing to a lower open on Wednesday as stocks continue to struggle during a historically strong period for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Since 1950, the S&P 500 has risen 1.3% during the seven trading days beginning Dec. 24, well above the typical seven-day average of 0.3%, according to LPL Financial chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist. History has shown that if Santa does come and the S&P 500 posts a positive return during the time period, then January is typically a positive month for the benchmark index and the rest of the year averages a 10.4% return. When the S&P 500 is negative during that time frame, January usually doesn't end in the green, and the return for the upcoming full year averages just 5%, per Turnquist. Three days into this year's Santa Claus period, which will close on Friday, Jan. 3, the S&P 500 is down less than 0.1% While history may be flashing a warning sign, it's notable that last year the Santa Claus rally didn't materialize. January started poorly too. Still, the S&P 500 is still set to end the year up more than 20%.

In a separate development, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq announced trading will be closed on Thursday, Jan. 9, for a day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100 at his home in Plains, Georgia. Four days into the highly anticipated "Santa Claus" rally, which is statistically one of the most consistent seven-day positive stretches of the year for the S&P 500, the benchmark index is lower. But Wall Street strategists argue this doesn't change their stance much on 2025. Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the "fundamentals" that have driven the market rally remain intact. "If the fundamental story holds, we would be buyers of first half pullbacks in the S&P 500," Chronert wrote. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee agrees. "In our view, nothing has fundamentally changed," Lee wrote. "The change in character of markets (towards caution) started with the December [Federal Reserve] rate decision and the Fed forecasting fewer cuts in 2025 from 4 to 2 ...And incrementally, there has not been any real change." Shares of Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) skyrocketed nearly 30% on Monday after billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who owns shares in both stocks, posted on social media that he expects President-elect Donald Trump to remove the companies from conservatorship. Ackman wrote on X that what makes these stocks interesting to him is "there is a credible path for their removal from conservatorship in the relative short term, that is, in the next two years." Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre reports: One thing President-elect Donald Trump can probably count on next year is falling oil prices, thanks to growing global supply. “Demand is not the primary concern as global oil demand growth is expected to slow from 1.3 million barrels per day this year to 1.1 mbd next year ... Instead, the real challenge lies in the excess supply,” Natasha Kaneva, head of the Global Commodities Strategy team at JPMorgan, wrote in a recent note. Kaneva and her team predict Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, which is on track to average roughly $80 for 2024, will tumble to an average of $73 in 2025. The analysts point to incoming supply from large-scale offshore developments in Brazil, Guyana, Senegal, and Norway. Read more here. The broad-based rally seen in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has all but disappeared in the final month of the year. On Monday alone, 408 stocks in the index were underperforming the S&P 500. The S&P 500 Equal Weigh Index (^SPXEW), which isn't impacted by the movements in large stock like its market-weighted counterpart, can be one sign of the market rally broadening. If the equal weight index is outperforming the benchmark index, it shows many stocks in the index are participating in a given rally. The opposite has happened in December. The S&P 500 Equal Weight is on pace to have its worst month against the S&P 500 since March 2020, per Bespoke Investment Group. Nvidia (NVDA) stock reversed direction following a report from The Information that its customer, ByteDance, plans to spend $7 billion on its AI chips in 2025 despite US export restrictions on goods to China. Nvidia shares were up 1.8% midday after falling as much as 2% earlier in the trading session. Chinese TikTok parent ByteDance has reportedly been using Nvidia's Hopper AI chips in data centers outside of its home country to avoid US trade restrictions, which have ramped up under the Biden administration and are expected to further tighten under President-elect Donald Trump. It is unclear whether the $7 billion commitment from ByteDance represents growth in its spending on Nvidia GPUs from the current calendar year. Nvidia's gain Monday brings the stock into the green for the month after a sharp decline in mid-December. "NVDA shares have underperformed mega cap peers since June, but had very strong performance in 2024," D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email Monday. "That means some investors may want to add NVDA as window dressing for their end of year reports, which should help the stock during the last two days of the year." All three of the major indexes were off their session lows around 12:30 p.m. ET on Monday. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC), the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) were all off by about 0.7%. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 had been down more than 1.6% at one point in the day. An upswing in Nvidia (NVDA) helped the revival, as the stock, which opened lower on Monday, was up about 1.5%. US natural gas futures for February delivery soared on Monday, rising as much as 20% as demand for fuel rose amid expectations of a colder January. This marked the largest one-day move since the contract started trading in 2012, according to Bloomberg. The pop in natural gas spread to the equity market. Energy (XLE) was the lone S&P 500 (^GSPC) sector in the green, up about 0.15% on the day. Read more on the natural gas spike here. While stocks are slumping Monday, 2024 was still a year of records on Wall Street with the S&P 500 clinching 57 records to fall into the top five years for most all-time highs recorded by the benchmark index. Two years into the bull market, strategists pin the rally on strong corporate earnings and outsized momentum from several members of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, which include chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), along with Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: 25.75% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading AI GPU designer whose shares have gained more than 700% since OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. The firm commands the lion's share of the AI GPU market as it enjoys a large competitive advantage through the performance of its chips. Yet, since AI is a relatively nascent industry and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) doesn't enjoy a similar presence in other markets, its shares are dependent on AI's fate. The stock has struggled since July as investors wait to see NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell products, supply chain strengths, and cost control. Here's what Cramer said in August: "Nvidia's Jensen Huang has been telling you can get 4x your money if you buy his chips. That's 4x return. I think Meta could end up getting that. The others, they actually have to spend to play catchup. It's not mythical, it's reality. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?" Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How Return Of Capital Can Lead Closed-End Fund Investors Astray
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/12/29/how-return-of-capital-can-lead-closed-end-fund-investors-astray/

Confused middle aged 60s woman in glasses getty The other day, we broke down how return of capital (ROC) can be both good and bad for investors in 8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs). But in the case of high-quality CEFs, ROC is, contrary to what most people think, a good thing. Today we’re going to look at some real-world examples to explain how, in fact, return of capital can make up a large share of a fund’s returns. To do so, we’re going to go into five Nuveen funds, the Nuveen S&P 500 Buy-Write Income Fund (BXMX), Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX), Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX) and Nuveen Core Equity Alpha Fund (JCE). Except for JCE, which I’ll get to in a moment, these are all covered-call funds that hold the index to which they correspond, then sell call options on part of that index, to essentially “translate” volatility into income for investors. These four funds have strong records of doing this, with all but DIAX up over 100% in the last decade (DIAX, in orange below, is the laggard here, up 86.4%, largely because its index rises more slowly than those tracked by SPXX, BXMX and QQQX). Fund Performance Ycharts These types of funds have a place in a diversified portfolio as a way to collect income, especially since they yield 7.2% on average. That’s obviously much more than the paltry 1.3% the average S&P 500 stock pays, as of this writing. The funny thing about that big yield is that it tends to attract naysayers who will tell you that these funds are just charging fees and giving you back your capital, hence the vast majority of their returns are labeled as return of capital (see right-hand column below). Return of Capital Percentage SEC In BXMX’s case, 91.3% of the distribution is classed as ROC, while SPXX is a tad higher and QQQX is a tad lower, with DIAX far behind, at 69.5%. JCE appears to be the best of the bunch here, with 25.5% of distributions being ROC. To be clear, these funds are not just giving you back your capital, as their healthy profits over the last decade prove. We discussed the technicalities of this in Thursday’s article. Now I want to focus on using ROC as an investment signal for these funds. Already we can tell that ROC is not a useful signal, since DIAX has been the worst performer for a decade, but its ROC ratio is lower than those of BXMX, SPXX and QQQX. However, this doesn’t mean we should go to the opposite extreme and say more ROC is the sign of a good fund: JCE’s much smaller portion of ROC coincides with it outperforming all of these covered-call funds in 2024, with a 24.6% return year to date, as of this writing. The reason why JCE has outrun the rest isn’t down to the ROC amounts—it’s because, unlike the others, this is an actively managed fund, meaning management can buy and sell stocks as they see fit. So they can, for instance, lower the fund’s exposure to NVIDIA (NVDA) when that stock shoots up in price. That’s unlike QQQX, which needs to buy more NVIDIA shares as the stock rises in price and thus becomes a bigger portion of the NASDAQ 100, which QQQX tracks. That’s also why JCE has done better than all of these covered-call funds combined over the last decade, returning 179% versus the covered-call funds’ average 103.6% return. So we can see that one of the real keys to maximizing profits and income in CEFs isn’t obsessing over ROC, but instead focusing on indicators like portfolio quality, management and historical performance. This is especially true when we compare funds of different types: JCE is not a covered-call fund, so the nature of its profits to investors is fundamentally different from those funds, since income from selling call options is recognized as capital gains. What’s more, selling call options also means you’ll sometimes have stocks that are down in price be sold, or “called away,” resulting in the fund realizing losses that offset the capital gains it received from selling the call options. This is also why covered-call funds tend to underperform over the long haul, especially if they are more passively managed, as our four covered-call funds are. The key takeaway here is that if you’re shopping for a CEF, do yourself a favor and ignore the chatter about ROC, so much of which is misinformed and confused. In reality, ROC is more often than not an advantage, because it amounts to tax-free income for American shareholders. And that means using funds that maximize ROC can be a great way to offset gains elsewhere or to boost income without boosting your tax burden. That’s a great reason why, despite their slight underperformance, funds like QQQX and SPXX might actually give you a higher net profit than a fund that has a higher return on paper, like JCE.

Title: Investing.com's stocks of the year
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/investingcoms-stocks-of-the-year-3789983

Investing.com -- 2024 has been a year of significant market shifts, with some companies soaring to new heights while others faced significant headwinds. Investing.com has compiled a list of some of the year's most notable performers: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares struggled for the first part of the year, but that changed in November after the U.S. election, with Elon Musk having aligned himself with President-elect Donald Trump. Musk’s support on the campaign trail and his appointment, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy in heading up Trump's Department of Government Efficiency has helped to boost Tesla's stock as investors look at it as a "Trump trade". In a recent note, analysts at Baird raised their target for Tesla to $480 from $280, based on strong growth prospects in the automaker, supported by cost reductions, new models, and favorable regulatory dynamics. “The stock has gained significant momentum and has several upcoming potential catalysts. We like the stock long term and would be buyers on pullbacks,” the firm said. A potential regulatory fast track for the Cybercab, the rollout of affordable vehicles, and Musk's ties to President-elect Trump has Baird bullish on Tesla’s outlook for 2025. With Bitcoin also surging following the presidential election as investors expect a favorable environment for the sector, cryptocurrency-focused stocks have also rallied. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) started its rally ahead of the election and is up nearly 400% (as of December 27) this year. The stock, seen as a bellwether for Bitcoin exposure, was driven by surging Bitcoin prices and the company’s continued commitment to its cryptocurrency holdings. Meanwhile, Coinbase (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:COIN) and Robinhood (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:HOOD) also benefitted from the crypto resurgence, up over 58% and 216% this year, respectively. The sector’s stellar performance in recent months reflects a growing belief in the crypto market as Trump prepares to take office in January. Since August, Palantir has skyrocketed and is also up close to 400% this year, solidifying its place as one of the top performers. The company’s software solutions and growing adoption across government and private sectors have made it a standout in the data analytics space. Wedbush analysts reiterated their Outperform rating and $75 target for the company’s shares in a note, stating: “With AI spending expected to ramp significantly within IT budgets in 2025, we believe the Messi of AI Palantir is in a prime spot to continue expanding its pipeline/deal flow.” They added: “We believe Palantir has a credible path to morph into the next Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) over the coming decade with AIP leading the way as many on the Street continue to be huge skeptics of the Messi of AI." While the stocks above primarily rallied towards the end of the year, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) made significant gains between January and June. After a pullback, it moved higher once again between August and November and is up over 175% this year. Nvidia has continued to capitalize on the demand stemming from AI. The company’s strategic positioning at the forefront of the AI revolution made it an essential stock for growth-focused investors. Truist analysts said they are “incrementally constructive” on Nvidia’s AI dominance, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock and raising the price target to $204 from $169 in a note. The firm noted that the stock has “been a home-run investment over the last two years owing to a new wave of AI demand,” and they expect 2025 to be “another constructive year.” They state that “all relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” while they believe “NVDA will announce a client-side CPU during 2025, opening up an additional ~$35B TAM.” In contrast to the names above, Intel has seen its stock plummet by 60% year-to-date. Challenges surrounding the company’s health and outlook have weighed heavily on its performance. Intel has struggled to maintain its leadership in the global chip market, ceding ground to rivals like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia. The abrupt removal of CEO Pat Gelsinger marked a dramatic turn, casting further doubt on the chipmaker’s ambitious turnaround plans. In a research note, Wolfe Research told investors that the biggest issue facing INTC is that “they simply don’t have the scale to be an IDM [Integrated Device Manufacturer] any longer, and the possibility of getting help from TSMC is going to be very difficult." Earlier this month, it was reported that two Intel executives said a manufacturing spinoff is possible if a new chipmaking technology slated for next year does not succeed.

Title: 5 A.I. Trends to Watch in 2025: Agentic A.I., 3D Models, Synthetic Data and More

In the first eight months of 2024, Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) collectively recorded a staggering $125 billion in A.I.-related capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating costs, according to a September JPMorgan report. The cumulative CapEx of these four tech giants alone is expected to soar past the $200 billion mark for the entirety of 2024. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. A.I. startups, meanwhile, received unprecedented amounts of funding from investors eager to cash in on the technology’s lucrative potential. OpenAI is set to finish out 2024 as the most well-funded A.I. company, most recently valued at $157 billion. Its rival Anthropic is gearing up for new fundraising that cold value it at $40 billion. Flush with cash, leading A.I. companies are now tasked with the challenge of proving to investors—and the public—that their pricy bets on the new technology will pay off. From an ongoing pivot into “agentic A.I.” to emerging new scaling laws and wide-ranging explorations of A.I.’s myriad capabilities, here’s a look at what 2025 will bring to the world of A.I.: The buzzword refers to autonomous A.I. assistants able to complete tasks without human oversight. The potential of A.I. agents to enhance workplaces and everyday life quickly caught notice in Silicon Valley, with companies like Salesforce embracing agents as their next major product. Microsoft, too, has rolled out a slew of A.I. agents in recent months. In November, it unveiled several A.I. assistants customized for its Microsoft 365 suite, including an agent able to provide translation in nine different languages. OpenAI is also on the “agentic A.I.” train, with an upcoming model expected to be able to perform tasks like booking travel and writing code. A.I. agents are “the thing that will feel like the next giant breakthrough,” said Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, during a recent AMA on Reddit. The global market for A.I. agents is currently valued at more than $5 billion, according to the research firm MarketsandMarkets. By the end of the decade, this figure is expected to soar to $47 billion, driven in part by demand for agents amongst enterprise clients. One of the key components of A.I.’s success in recent years has been the mass amounts of data fed into A.I. models. But there’s only a finite amount of text, images and videos on the internet. To avoid a plateau in the technology’s development, A.I. companies are turning to alternative ways to train their models. One of the most promising solutions is test-time compute, where A.I. models improve by reasoning and taking longer to think about potential answers before responding—a theory most recently demonstrated by OpenAI’s o1 model. On an earnings call in November, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang described OpenAI’s new model as “one of the most exciting developments” in scaling and noted that “the longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces.” Huang isn’t alone in his optimism. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also pointed towards test-time compute as a new scaling law in November, while OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever earlier this month highlighted it as a progression of A.I.’s pre-training era. Another solution to A.I.’s data crisis is replacing traditional data with information generated by the technology itself. The market for synthetic data is expected to skyrocket to $2.1 billion by 2028, representing an over 450 percent hike from 2022, according to BCC Research. Altman hinted at the potential of synthetic data a year ago when discussing A.I.’s dwindling data supply, remarking in an interview that “as long as you can get over the synthetic data event horizon, where the model is smart enough to make good synthetic data, I think it should be all right.” OpenAI, alongside competitors like Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft and Google, have all reportedly begun using synthetic data in some way to train and fine-tune models. In October, the A.I. startup Writer unveiled a new A.I. model trained entirely by A.I.-generated data. The approach allowed the company to cut significant costs in developing the model, which totaled at a mere $700,000 in comparison to the millions doled out by other companies. OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, for example, cost more than $100 million to train. Until now, much of A.I.’s visual outputs have remained two-dimensional, something tech pioneers are looking to shift in the coming years. “Large world models” are an emerging form of A.I. that aims to build interactive three-dimensional scenes advancing the worlds of movies, games and simulators. One of the largest players in this space is World Labs, a new startup established by Stanford A.I. pioneer Fei-Fei Li that raised $230 million earlier this year. The venture is looking to build large world models with “spatial intelligence,” a form of intelligence that understands and interacts with the real world. To demonstrate this concept, Li has previously used the example of a cat reaching out to topple over a glass of milk and humans’ ability to predict the consequence of this event and therefore take action to prevent the glass from falling. At the beginning of December, Google DeepMind launched its own large world model in the form of Genie 2, which simulates virtual environments that will be used to train and evaluate A.I. agents. The area will likely be a key focus for the lab going forward, as evidenced by its recent hiring of Tim Brooks, a former OpenAI researcher overseeing its video generator Sora. In an X post welcoming Brooks to his team, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis noted his excitement at “working together to make the long-standing dream of a world simulator a reality.” Google has long had a seemingly untouchable dominance on the search market. But with the advent of A.I., a proliferation of A.I.-powered search engines is looking to shake the tech giant’s foothold. Not that Google hasn’t embraced the technology itself. In 2024, it rolled out AI Overviews, a feature that provides users with A.I.-generated summaries rather than links. CEO Sundar Pichai predicts the feature will attract more than 1 billion users monthly users and is already “increasing overall search usage and user satisfaction,” he told Wall Street analysts in October. But Google will have to contend with an increasingly crowded industry for search tools, as companies like OpenAI and Microsoft expand into the arena with the help of A.I. Meta is also reportedly preparing to launch its own A.I.-powered search engine, while the startup Perplexity AI has emerged as an especially formidable player. Recently valued at $9 billion, its A.I. search tools already process around 20 million queries on a daily basis, up from 2.5 million at the beginning of 2024.

We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. Investors are looking for new growth horizons in the AI industry to gauge whether the current market rally can continue for the years to come. Chetan Puttagunta, Benchmark general partner, said he’s noticed a lot of innovation in the past few weeks focused on improving the efficiency of algorithms. “In the last six to eight weeks, we’ve seen a tremendous amount of innovation, especially at the model layer, and then for the last two years at the application layer, taking advantage of all the advances in the AI models. Specifically, what’s happening at the model layer is, as we move into an inference-time or test-time compute paradigm, you’re seeing a lot more advantage to entrepreneurs and technical founders that are able to push to the frontier with algorithmic innovation.” To explain how AI is now actually improving workflows, Puttagunta gave the example of Sierra, a conversational AI startup making customer service solutions. “So think of this Sierra AI agent, if you will, delivering the best customer service agent experience every time, replicated an infinite number of times. And that’s an experience that was previously not possible without AI.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that are making moves amid the latest news. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jessica Lessin, The Information founder, editor-in-chief and CEO, recently discussed the state of AI space and her outlook on 2025. She mentioned the rising competition in the industry. “I think 2025 is going to be the year where all bets are off—or rather, all gloves are off—in AI competition. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will dominate GPUs, but you’re also seeing Broadcom and others partnering with tech companies to diversify. Last week, at The Information, we reported that Broadcom is now working with Apple on an AI chip for inference. While it doesn’t directly compete with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), there is significant competition in the space. I believe investors should stay very vigilant and try to understand the dynamics within each tech company. The key question inside these firms is: how can we build, build, build to create more optionality in AI technology?” Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. Nvidia’s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on ARM Holdings plc (ARM): ‘I Prefer ARM Holdings Over Intel In The Current Tech Landscape’

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bearish Calls: 10 Tech Stocks Heading for a Crash. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other tech stocks. For Jim Cramer, tech stocks and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts are a major talking point. Investors continued to deal with an uncertain macroeconomic picture that was complicated by a 'bullish dove' of a Fed that cut interest rates by 25 basis points but also hinted that 2025 would see fewer rate cuts than expected. The day the Fed announced the interest rate cut, the benchmark flagship S&P index sank by 2.95%, with more speculative investments such as Bitcoin dropping by a sharper 8.6%. Yet, as has been the case with the macroeconomic picture, the sell-off appeared to be a bit too much. Two days later, on Friday, the Commerce Department released the ever-important Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) dataset. The PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation reading, and it revealed that the annualized inflation in November was 2.4%. This reading was shy of 0.1 percentage point of economist expectations. As a result, it signaled to investors that perhaps the Fed might take it easy with the interest rates heading into 2025. The slightly improved expectations saw the S&P gain 1.86% on the day of the PCE data release. Cramer was optimistic as well, sharing that the data was "somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday." However, he added that the bullish data release didn't mean that markets would reverse all their losses since Wednesday. Despite the fact that inflation ticked lower, the S&P index is still down 1.83% since the data release. Cramer shared some insight into the reasons behind the weakness. According to him, the market has been speculating a lot on areas such as quantum computing and Bitcoin. The CNBC host outlined that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" had driven the market performance ahead of the rate announcement. Consequently, since these areas lack fundamentals, investors might not have immediately returned to them. His Squawk on the Street appearance the day after the rate cut was also full of pessimism for quantum computing stocks. These stocks have gained as much as 162% over the past month - a development that would, on the surface, indicate a groundbreaking shift in their prospects. However, these movements have been driven primarily by Google's Willow quantum computing chip. The hype surrounding quantum computing is understandable as Willow claims to solve a problem that would take a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years to solve in less than five minutes. However, Cramer remains unconvinced about this technology niche. Commenting on the stock that ranked 16th on this list of stocks that he talked about, the host wondered what had driven its 162% in returns. Likening quantum computing stocks to non-fungible tokens, Cramer commented: "How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” As for the Fed, he believes that the central bank's data-dependent strategies backfired with the bullish rate outlook as "they chose not to be data-dependent." On the episode of Mad Money aired the day of the rate cut, he speculated that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to have been "caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn’t back it up." Cramer added that he believed "It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” On the next day, Cramer added the Fed might have been better off ahead of the call not having signaled that it was going to cut rates. However, as it did the opposite, it was locked into cutting rates while the data pointed towards a robust economy that might not have needed lower interest rates. "I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates," shared Cramer and added that the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped.” For 2025, Cramer wants investors to focus on stocks that might change the world. In a recent Mad Money episode, he outlined that some stocks tend to stand against the tide due to fiercely loyal followers. Sharing some advice, Cramer stated: “There’s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we’re in one of those moments. In 2025, let’s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.” Our Methodology To make our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech stock calls, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks he was bearish on, analyzed their performance, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). High angle view of a semiconductor chip against an array of electronics components. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 68 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-22-24 Performance Since Then: -2.20% ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is a British chip design house whose IP is present in the majority of smartphone processors and other chips. This enables the firm to enjoy a wide moat, which has strengthened in today's era of data centers and cloud computing. Big tech firms have used ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)'s designs to make in-house chips. The firm has also sought to further solidify its market presence by providing an off-the-shelf solution to firms looking to design chips. However, ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)'s shares are down by 16% over the past six months as they have been driven by the firm's inability to significantly benefit from the ongoing AI boom despite its near-ubiquity in the smartphone industry. In August, Cramer shared that he preferred ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) over Intel, and the latter's stock has lost 5.6% since his comments: "Intel is struggling with competition from AMD and Nvidia, and I prefer ARM Holdings over Intel in the current tech landscape. Intel has challenges but may benefit if it can leverage AI advances effectively." Overall ARM ranks 6th among the tech stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Escalating US-China Trade War to Hurt These Tech Stocks in 2025
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/escalating-us-china-trade-war-153500064.html
Time Published: 2024-12-27T15:35:00Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The ongoing US-China trade war has intensified, with technology being a primary battleground. What began as a tussle over trade imbalances has evolved into a strategic clash over technological supremacy. Over the past few years, the United States has tightened its export restrictions, limiting China's access to advanced semiconductor technologies critical for Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G and supercomputing. Key players like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Micron Technology, Inc. MU, Intel Corporation INTC and QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM have been caught in the crossfire, facing regulatory and market challenges that jeopardize their growth prospects. Recent measures, including the U.S. Commerce Department's export controls on advanced AI chips and chipmaking tools, aim to curb China’s technological advancements. While these restrictions align with the U.S. national security objectives, they have disrupted the semiconductor supply chain and stoked economic tensions. In retaliation, China has imposed restrictions on rare earth metals critical for semiconductor production. The escalating trade war has created a challenging environment for U.S. tech companies reliant on the Chinese market. As we step into 2025, uncertainties surrounding the conflict are poised to affect revenue streams, supply chains and investor sentiment. Here's a closer look at how leading semiconductor players like NVIDIA, Micron, Intel and QUALCOMM could bear the brunt of these challenges. NVIDIA has been a proponent of the U.S. government’s restrictions throughout the past three years. In 2022, the U.S. government restricted NVIDIA from selling its A100, A100X and H100 integrated circuits to China and Russia. In 2023, the United States imposed new restrictions on selling two AI chips — A800 and H800 — specifically created for the Chinese market. This year, the U.S. government restricted the export of NVIDIA's advanced A100 and H100 GPUs to China, a key market for AI development. The U.S. government is continuing its efforts toward restricting China from getting its hands on cutting-edge technologies that can strengthen its military. These kinds of restrictions are going to hurt NVIDIA’s business in China with a negative impact on its top line, margin and cash slows further jeopardizing its ability to support existing customers and complete the development of certain products timely. NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Micron Technology had found itself in the middle of this tug-of-war long ago. For the company, chip sales in China make up more than 10% of its total revenues. In October 2022, the United States imposed an export ban on certain advanced chips that are used in data centers for AI, data analytics and computing applications with the intention of stopping these chips from getting into Chinese hands. Later in 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China imposed a restriction on Micron on selling its products in key domestic industries on national security concerns. Tit-for-tat actions like these have the potential to jeopardize the company’s prospects, which are already afflicted by the weak demand for its memory chips. Moreover, the memory chip market’s cyclical nature, combined with these geopolitical tensions, could exacerbate its financial volatility in 2025. Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote Intel’s total revenues experienced a whopping 27% contribution from its Chinese customers in 2023. The company faces unique challenges due to its reliance on both China for manufacturing and the United States for research & development. China’s latest stance of replacing U.S.-made chips with domestic alternatives has become a concern for Intel. The country’s latest decision to phase out foreign chips from its major telecom networks by 2027, coupled with the U.S. government’s directive to revoke Intel’s chip export licenses to the Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei, has a big potential to affect the company’s top line. Although Intel has been heavily investing in its foundry business to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing, these efforts may take years to bear fruit. The company’s struggles to regain market leadership in the face of geopolitical headwinds could further pressure its bottom line and stock performance in 2025. Intel Corporation price-consensus-chart | Intel Corporation Quote QUALCOMM has a lot to lose from the US-China trade war as a major part of its business comes from China. The company has also set up multiple manufacturing facilities in China. In early 2024, Qualcomm faced the same restrictions as Intel where the U.S. government revoked its chip export license for certain technologies to Huawei. Retaliation from the Chinese trade associations and government can worsen QCOM’s situation. The Chinese government has already put policies, such as the Made in China 2025 initiative aiming for 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025. These policies can enable QUALCOMM’s existing customers to develop their own chipsets . QUALCOMM Incorporated price-consensus-chart | QUALCOMM Incorporated Quote The escalating US-China tech war presents a formidable challenge for U.S. semiconductor companies like NVIDIA, Micron, Intel and Qualcomm. These companies are not only grappling with the immediate effects of export restrictions and retaliatory measures but also facing long-term structural shifts in global supply chains and competitive dynamics. Investors should exercise caution and closely monitor developments in the trade conflict as these could significantly impact the semiconductor industry’s growth trajectory in 2025. While U.S. tech stocks have historically been robust performers, the geopolitical landscape could bring volatility that warrants careful portfolio positioning. At present, NVIDIA and QUALCOMM each carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Micron and Intel each have a Zaks Rank #3 (Hold).

Title: OpenAI may become a for-profit because it needs 'more capital than imagined'
URL: https://qz.com/openai-for-profit-sam-altman-investors-capital-musk-xai-1851729227

OpenAI has revealed a plan to restructure its operations and more cleanly separate the for-profit and non-profit arms of its business as it seeks to raise more cash. The artificial intelligence startup has been discussing plans to restructure for several months now, according to various reports, as it tries to attract new investors. OpenAI raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion evaluation in its latest round of funding, which was reportedly led by Joshua Kushner’s Thrive Capital and backed by Microsoft (MSFT-0.56%) and Nvidia (NVDA-1.81%). But that’s not enough. “The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission,” OpenAI’s board wrote in a new blog post. “We once again need to raise more capital than we’d imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.” Under OpenAI’s current structure, the company’s investors are issued equity by its for-profit arm, which is overseen by its non-profit board, whose “principal beneficiary is humanity, not OpenAI investors.” The company announced its “capped profit” structure in 2019, after founding the company in 2015 as a non-profit. “As we enter 2025, we will have to become more than a lab and a startup — we have to become an enduring company,” OpenAI wrote, adding that its plans “enable us to raise the necessary capital with conventional terms like others in this space.” The ChatGPT maker’s new plan includes establishing the for-profit arm of OpenAI as a public benefit company (PBC), mirroring a step taken by xAI — helmed by OpenAI founder Elon Musk — as well as Anthropic. Although such companies have a stated goal of positively impacting society, the pivot to establish AI firms as PBCs has led to accusations of “ethicswashing.” By setting up the for-profit arm as a PBC, OpenAI’s current board will be able to consider the interests of investors more easily, which could help it win over potential shareholders. xAI, despite being less than two years old, raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation earlier this month, while Anthropic has raised almost $14 billion in venture capital since it was founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI employees. Although details were not revealed by OpenAI on Friday, previous discussions had explored giving CEO Sam Altman about $150 billion of equity, according to Reuters. The non-profit side of the business will hire its own leadership team and staff to engage in charity involving the healthcare, education, and science sectors, according to OpenAI. It will also own “significant interest” in the for-profit side through stock determined at a “fair evaluation” determined by third-party advisors. OpenAI’s plans face a few hurdles, including a slew of recent executive departures and a revived lawsuit from Musk, who wants to stop the company from becoming a for-profit. In November, Musk expanded his lawsuit against the AI startup and several of its co-founders, accusing it of anticompetitive behavior and calling it a “market-paralyzing gorgon.” Later in the month, Musk’s attorneys filed a preliminary injunction against the AI startup, several of its co-founders, and Microsoft to stop its transition to a for-profit company. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The AI stock trade is starting to shift beyond the 'Magnificent 7'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Investor enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence has once again driven the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks to another banner year, with Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) stocks all recently hitting record highs while Nvidia (NVDA) shares boast a more than 175% gain this year. Next year, investors expect the hype to spread even further into areas like utilities and software stocks, which will continue to benefit from Big Tech's large AI bet. Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin projects the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will reach 6,500 by the end of 2025 and that the rest of the market's gains will come closer to those of large-cap tech stocks. "It's less about valuation but more about earnings growth that will dictate those returns," Kostin said during a Goldman Sachs 2025 media roundtable with reporters. "The narrowing of the differential between the growth rates is likely to lead to a narrowing of [difference in] the performance." The rapid earnings growth seen in large caps over the past 18 months is expected to slow, while earnings are expected to pick up for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500. BofA's equity strategy team, led by Savita Subramanian, issued a 6,666 year-end target for the S&P 500 in 2025 that includes a call for a broadening of earnings driven in part by AI. "AI is definitely playing a role in 2025 earnings," Subramanian told Yahoo Finance. "And in fact, one of the reasons that we're bullish on the broadening out of earnings is the idea that instead of everybody spending on tech capex, tech capex is actually picking up, and tech companies are sort of spending on a broader array of industries." To Subramanian's point, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta alone are expected to have increased capital expenditures by 42% in 2024 and another 17% in 2025, pushing their total spend next year to $244 billion. Not all of this spending is on AI chips. Tech companies are also ramping up spending to pay for the power required to run AI data centers. During a 2025 outlook roundtable with reporters, BlackRock's Investment Institute pointed out that the power required to operate one data center is about equal to the average amount of power used in a day by all of New York City. This has strategists, including BofA's Subramanian, bullish on the companies exposed to that part of the technology buildout, including the Utilities sector (XLU), which is already up more than 20% in 2024, partially driven by AI optimism. This part of the AI trade has already begun to shift. In his 2025 equity outlook, Kostin highlighted a basket of three potential AI trades, noting that the transition from "phase 1" stocks like Nvidia to "phase 2" stocks in Goldman's AI "infrastructure" bucket is already well underway. As seen in the dark blue line in the chart below, AI infrastructure stocks, which include other semiconductor companies like Arm Holdings (ARM) and utility power plays like Vistra Corp (VST), have already seen large rallies. In the year ahead, Goldman thinks the changing of the AI guard will further take hold as the trade moves to "phase 3" under a basket of stocks Goldman has dubbed "enabled revenues." These are a group of companies that will benefit from the rollout and monetization of AI solutions. In other words, those that can use AI to drive sales but aren't actually selling things like AI chips to other companies. A large portion of this basket of stocks that Goldman is tracking are software and services stocks, including names like Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM), and Adobe (ADBE). And as seen in the sharp move higher in the lighter blue line in the graph below, "phase 3" AI stocks are already catching a bid. For example, Salesforce shares recently added more than 10% after reporting earnings and citing the success of its new AI tool, Agentforce. Goldman added that this isn't necessarily a call for AI infrastructure stocks to underperform the market in 2025 but rather to point out which portions of the AI trade could have more upside. Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon agreed. As the AI trade enters its next phase, "there should be more focus, or an increasing amount of focus, on the adopters versus the creators," Gordon told Yahoo Finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks opened on a downbeat note as Wall Street slogged to the finish of a largely triumphant year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 2.2% Friday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gave up 1%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hovered near seven-month highs around 4.6%. After stacking impressive gains this year, some of the biggest names in tech are losing ground as investors take profits, rebalance their portfolios, or reassess their lofty valuations. Tesla (TSLA) on Friday lost more than 4%. Nvidia (NVDA) gave up 3%, while Amazon (AMZN) decreased by 2.5%. Wall Street has just three trading days remaining in a 2024 full of big gains, but markets have been unable to mount a "Santa Claus" rally into the end of the year. Markets have largely digested the year's remaining key economic data points, and investors are now turning their attention to two big themes for the coming year: the Federal Reserve's path for interest rates and the implications of Donald Trump's ascent back to the White House. On the former, stocks have largely taken in stride the Fed's plans to scale back rate cuts next year after an initial plunge last week. Bets have now shifted squarely to May as the next meeting at which the Fed will slash interest rates, as it continues to grapple with stubborn inflation while keeping a close eye on a cooling labor market. And on the latter, Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul writes that while Trump talked up his big plans during the campaign, especially on the economy, those plans could soon face a reality check from other key power players. The US government long had the nation’s biggest tech giants in its sights, and in 2024, it hit bull's-eye. The big victory came in August when the Justice Department convinced a federal district court judge that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) had abused its search engine dominance and violated antitrust law. What transpired in 2024 could have future implications for some of the other big names in the tech world, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are all defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims. For now, Wall Street doesn't appear rattled.
