Title: Why Nvidia and Other Chip Stocks' Slump Is an Opportunity for Investors, UBS Says

Semiconductor stocks are taking a chip out of U.S. indexes to start September—a month that's earned a reputation as the worst for American investors—but for some bulls on Wall Street, that could mean it's time to buy. "We recommend that investors who are underallocated to equities consider phasing in and using market dips to add exposure to preferred areas," UBS analysts said Tuesday, with tech and AI plays among their favorites, while chip stocks dragged on the sector to start the week. Nvidia (NVDA) was one of the worst-performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Tuesday afternoon, with shares down nearly 3%. Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down 2%. Tuesday's slide extended losses late last week, amid uncertainty after an appeals court Friday challenged the legality of the Trump administration's "reciprocal" tariffs, and concerns about America's relations with major trading partners. Treasury yields spiked as bonds sold off, which tends to weigh on the tech sector as higher yields may make growth stocks less attractive. Some investors could also be worried about September's reputation as a tough month for stocks—but that shouldn't discourage them, according to UBS analysts. That's because October and November tend to be strong months for U.S. stocks, they said, with average S&P 500 returns over the past decade of 1.2% and 4%, respectively. Buying in September could help investors position themselves for better performance in the months that follow. UBS also pointed to strong earnings in the second quarter, a robust outlook for AI demand, and expectations of a rate cut later this month as reasons supporting their optimism in the tech sector. "Alongside AI, power and resources, and longevity, we favor US technology, health care, utilities, and financials," the analysts said.

Title: What Nvidia's Earnings Could Mean for Broadcom and Other Chipmakers

Time Published: 2025-09-02T15:02:49Z

As one of the primary beneficiaries of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) stock has become a bellwether for industry, with its quarterly results last week offering some clues about what to expect from Broadcom (AVGO) later this week, and other chipmakers. Nvidia's earnings, which came in just ahead of Wall Street's estimates, largely received a bullish reception from analysts, who voiced confidence in demand for its AI hardware, though worries about China sales and geopolitical issues have weighed on the stock. Shares of Nvidia dropped nearly 3% in recent trading, and Broadcom shares slipped 1%, with other chip stocks extending last week's declines as uncertainty about tariffs and America's relations with major trading partners weighed on the major indexes. A diplomatic summit in Tianjin over the weekend with leaders from more than 20 non-Western countries, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, sought to showcase China's leadership amid trade tensions with the U.S. AI chipmaker Broadcom, which Oppenheimer analysts have called the "No. 2 AI franchise" after Nvidia, is set to report its fiscal third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, and could face some similar challenges related to its large exposure to China—as well as benefit from AI tailwinds. Like Nvidia, Broadcom derives a significant chunk of its sales from China, with the country accounting for roughly a fifth of Broadcom's revenue in its fiscal 2024, though that's declined from almost a third in 2023. Broadcom also claims some of the same Big Tech AI clients Nvidia does, including Meta Platforms (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), with their commitments to hefty AI spending expected to benefit the chipmaker. Citi analysts suggested last week Broadcom could also have plans with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Apple (AAPL) in its pipeline. The Citi analysts have a "buy" rating and $315 price target for the stock, which finished Friday's session around $297. Despite recent losses, it has added more than one-quarter of its value since the start of the year. Oppenheimer expects Broadcom could have even further to climb, with a $325 target, still well below a Street high of $350, according to Visible Alpha. Heading into the results, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom's stock, anticipating rising sales and profits. All of the 10 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha give it a "buy" or equivalent rating. CORRECTION—Sept. 2, 2025: This article has been corrected to reflect the U.S. was not represented at the summit in Tianjin and President Trump did not attend.

Title: NVIDIA & Magnificent 7: Too Hot To Handle?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/31/nvidia--magnificent-7-too-hot-to-handle/
Time Published: 2025-08-31T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

Title: From GPUs to tokens – How Nvidia’s optimism might influence the Crypto AI sector

Time Published: 2025-08-30T21:00:16Z
Full Content:
The Crypto AI sector has not kept pace with the wider altcoin market’s price gains. Nvidia’s fiscal report has projected sustained revenue growth for the next quarter, while tech companies like MongoDB and Pure Storage closed out a bullish week. Can this affect the Crypto AI sector’s sentiment? Nvidia [NVDA] is in the news today after it reported its Q2 fiscal results for the second quarter ended the 27th of July, 2025. Its revenue of $46.7 billion was up 6% from the previous quarter and 56% higher than a year ago. Its outlook for the third quarter remains bullish, with revenue expected to be as high as $54 billion. Referring to the Nvidia GPU architecture, Founder and CEO Jensen Huang said, “Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap — production of Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary.” He added that the “NVLink rack-scale computing is revolutionary” and that the AI race os on. The bullish commentary and the company’s aggressive share repurchase plans could be a sign of greater confidence. That’s not all though as demand hasn’t been slowing down. In fact, the strong growth in the company’s revenue seemed to be in contrast with signs of fatigue in AI-related stocks. Following the fiscal report release earlier in the week, NVDA’s stock saw a 5.95% correction. It fell from Thursday’s high at $184.13 to Friday’s low of $173.17. The generative AI boom in 2022, after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, meant that GPU manufacturers such as Nvidia and cloud vendors like Microsoft and Google were big winners. There have been some recent winners too, with Enterprise technology company MongoDB noting a 45.7% rally last week. CEO Dev Ittycheria, speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box, said, “You start to see deployments of agents to automate back office, maybe automate sales and marketing, but it’s still not yet kind of full force in the enterprise.” This statement captures the cautious optimism across the market. As far as Crypto AI tokens are concerned, it could take some time for decentralized AI solutions to gain traction. However, when traditional AI players such as NVDA see a hike in bullish sentiment, there will be some impact on the crypto AI sector. Source: TAO/USDT on TradingView At the time of writing, Bittensor [TAO], the biggest crypto AI token by market capitalization, was down 56% from its December high of $748. Bitcoin’s [BTC] performance since April has not been enough to lead TAO token to recovery either. Source: RENDER/USDT on TradingView Similarly, Render [RENDER] has depreciated by 70% from its December high of $11.9. Together, these two tokens highlighted how the AI token market sentiment may be risk-averse. Even though the altcoin market cap, including Ethereum [ETH], has expanded by nearly 60% since April’s lows, the AI sector has only managed 30%. AI tokens come with high risks, but also high rewards for buyers. Their performance would be dependent on the crypto market sentiment, as well as the wider market’s outlook on AI.
