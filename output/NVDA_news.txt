Title: XOVR ETF Adds Anduril, Joining SpaceX to Offer Pre-IPO Access

June 06, 2025 15:48 ET | Source: EntrepreneurShares EntrepreneurShares NEW YORK, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ERShares, the first Crossover ETF that offers retail investors access to Private companies, with SpaceX as its top weight, is ushering in the next generation of investing with a new private equity position in Anduril Industries. Through the XOVR ETF, which primarily invests (85% +) in the US Entrepreneurial Large Cap ER30TR Index, ERShares continues ...its pursuit to provide retail investors access to private equity—which we believe offers exposure to high-growth, entrepreneurial companies typically reserved for institutions and high net worth investors, and does so at the same pricing available to those accredited investors. XOVR complies with SEC guidelines by keeping private equity exposure under 15%, with over 85% of the portfolio tracking the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR)—built on ERShares’ proprietary Entrepreneur model, applied to public markets for more than two decades. Given its weighting, the ER30TR Index drives the majority of XOVR’s return, while the private holdings offer potential upside and added diversification. Private equity investments can experience significant price swings—both upward and downward—over extended periods, even if valuations are not marked frequently. Additionally, private equities are inherently less liquid and less transparent than their public counterparts, resulting in higher risk profiles despite comparable market capitalizations. As with all investments, public equities can be volatile, though they have historically offered meaningful return potential over time. Private companies may magnify both opportunity and risk, which is why ERShares encourages investors to consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions. To help manage risk, ERShares applies structured parameters around the size and scope of its private holdings. The due diligence process for these positions mirrors the same rigorous methodology used in constructing the ER30TR Index—adapted for private markets. Relaunched on August 29, 2024, XOVR became the first ETF to blend public equities with private equity holdings – potentially delivering diversified, liquid access to both high-growth public companies and elite pre-IPO firms. This ETF Crossover structure helps bridge two previously disconnected markets in one transparent vehicle. On May 30, 2025, ERShares initiated a $3M (approx. 1%) investment in Anduril, marking XOVR’s third private equity holding - after SpaceX ($33M, approx. 10%) and Klarna ($2M, less than 1%) - and establishing Anduril as its second-largest private position. The move reflects ERShares’ conviction in companies that sit at the intersection of innovation, national importance, and scalable disruption. The position was selected after extensive internal research and due diligence, consistent with ERShares’ proprietary Venture Capital-style framework for evaluating private and public companies. “Our proprietary research model identifies category-defining companies before they go public,” said Dr. Joel Shulman, Founder and CIO of ERShares. “Anduril embodies the deep tech leadership and mission-driven innovation we seek for XOVR.” ERShares also recently increased its SpaceX position at $185 per share - matching its previous entries - to reaffirm confidence in the company’s valuation amid market speculation. Bridging Public and Private Markets “We’re not just following innovation - we’re positioning investors at its source,” said Eva Ados, Chief Investment Strategist at ERShares. “Whether private or public, our focus is on trying to identify the next Magnificent Seven (The "Magnificent 7" currently refers to a group of seven large-cap, high-growth U.S. technology companies: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA))—those rare, transformational companies that have the potential to shape entire decades of innovation and growth.” Anduril Industries: The Next Generation of Defense Technology Founded by Palmer Luckey - creator of Oculus and a key early collaborator with Palantir - Anduril Industries represents the next generation of defense technology. Anduril is rapidly becoming foundational to U.S. military modernization initiatives. Transparent Valuation Backed by Research ERShares uses a structured valuation methodology to price private equity holdings - drawing from tender offers, internal transactions, IPO indicators, and comparables – to help ensure pricing is fair, consistent, and market-aware. This framework helps protect investors while maintaining daily liquidity and regulatory compliance. Investing in the Future - Before the IPO With positions in SpaceX, Klarna, and now Anduril, XOVR remains the only ETF offering diversified access to potentially high growth private companies alongside expanding public innovators. The fund allows investors to participate in the potential next wave of value creation - before it goes public. “We built XOVR to give retail investors access to leading private companies at the critical pre-IPO stage,” added Dr. Shulman. “It is time they participate in the value creation that was once reserved only for institutions and accredited investors.” Past performance is no guarantee of future results, please refer to the disclosures below for important risk information: https://entrepreneurshares.com/disclosures/ All investing involves risk, including potential loss of principal.

Title: Microsoft stock just hit a record high as it cashes in on the AI boom
URL: https://qz.com/microsoft-intraday-stock-high-ai-june-2025-1851783771
Time Published: 2025-06-05T20:07:00Z
Full Content:
Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) stock just clocked an intraday record on Thursday ($468.49), a milestone that caps off the company’s aggressive AI moves — and even more aggressive expectations. Wall Street isn’t just rewarding Microsoft for showing up to the AI race, it’s pricing in a future where the company leads the pack. The surge marks the company’s biggest high since July 2024 and follows a series of announcements that signal how deeply AI is baked into Microsoft’s business. Recently, the company has laid out a massive infrastructure plan, unveiled custom AI chips for Azure, and kept investors buzzing with sharp revenue growth across its cloud and productivity divisions. In many ways, Microsoft’s stock high isn’t just about AI — it’s about the company’s ability to industrialize it. The AI narrative isn’t new, but Microsoft is increasingly making it look real. While Google (GOOGL-1.57%) is experimenting and Amazon (AMZN-2.87%) is largely building behind the scenes, Microsoft is out there productizing — and monetizing — faster than most expected. GitHub Copilot is gaining traction. Microsoft 365 is increasingly AI-native. Azure has become the go-to cloud for businesses that want ready-to-go AI tools. Microsoft had a rocky start to the year (a 10% decline from its July 2024 peak) but it’s rebounded sharply, thanks largely to strong cloud growth — Azure revenue jumped 33% in the 2025 fiscal third quarter — and continued momentum in AI integration. Now, Microsoft’s stock is up about 12% year-to-date (and 30% since April of this year), easily outperforming fellow tech giants such as Apple (AAPL-0.39%), Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%). The recent rally has added over $800 billion to Microsoft’s market capitalization, and the company’s performance positions it as one of the more stable, high-conviction bets in a tech sector that is increasingly divided between hype and execution. Earlier this year, Microsoft committed to spending $80 billion in fiscal 2025 — most of it on AI-enabled data centers. That’s a figure that suggests CEO Satya Nadella sees AI as Microsoft’s cloud moment all over again. And the market seems to agree. Behind the rally, analysts are circling with revised playbooks. The average analyst price target shows almost double-digit potential over the coming year. And some analysts predict that Microsoft’s AI initiatives could bring in over $10 billion annually.

Title: Rise Of The Machines: A Dividend Revolution Yielding Up To 9.7%

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Army of robots. 3D illustration Big companies are about to make even more money. They have discovered they no longer need armies of new hires to grow—extremely bullish news for shareholders because human employees are expensive. Good ones can also be notoriously elusive. For example, I’m the longest-standing member of my kids’ school marketing committee, and we’re always scrambling for volunteers (what non-profit isn’t?). Until now, that is. Over the weekend, we welcomed the most talented marketer I’ve ever worked with to our team: ChatGPT 4.5. “GPT” graciously accepted our volunteer position, and we’re already actively boosting online referrals for the school. I’m learning cutting-edge “AI referral” techniques straight from the entity that invented them. It was the easiest recruitment effort I’ve ever experienced. GPT and I were already collaborating closely to market and sell several software products, so extending our teamwork to the non-profit world was seamless. The same dynamic is quietly playing out at for–profit companies, particularly the tech giants that dominate the cap-weighted S&P 500. A senior executive friend at Meta (META) recently confirmed to me that the company has essentially frozen hiring, pivoting entirely toward AI-driven growth. It already shows in the numbers. Over the past year Meta has increased revenues by 22% while only hiring 10% more people. Sales are growing faster than humans, a trend that I expect to accelerate in the months and years ahead. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if Meta has already reached peak headcount—which means profits are set to surge even more. And Meta isn’t alone in this “growing without hiring” trend. Alphabet (GOOG) grew revenues by 14% without any net new hires. And Nvidia (NVDA) did grow headcount by 13%, but for good reason—sales exploded by 126%! Microsoft (MSFT) is likewise sailing along without the need for new engineers, with 16% revenue growth on just a 3% headcount increase: Tech Growth The AI adoption at these companies is just beginning. These profit machines are already selling $1 to $2 million in product per employee, but their profits are going to pop as they sell even more without the expense drag of adding new employees! This four-pack packs 20% of the S&P 500 index. When we combine Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), Netflix (NFLX) and Apple (AAPL)—four more tech companies that are scaling without hiring—we have 32% of the index. Earlier in the year, I warned that the “tech heaviness” of the S&P 500 was dangerous—and it sure was during the tariff troubles of March and April. But with trade tensions fading and tech profits exploding thanks to lean payrolls, these big 8 companies are now set to power the index higher. Plus, we have a weakening US dollar. Stocks are, of course, priced in dollars. So, a softer dollar is another bullish catalyst for the S&P 500. As income investors, we can tap this rising tide for steady income. To do so, we’ll use covered calls—a strategy where we buy stocks and then sell (“write”) call options to other investors. We earn income now from the option premiums we collect, paid upfront to agree to sell our shares at a higher price later. Market volatility from a tumultuous spring means these options pay generous premiums right now (covered call options pay more when things are bouncing around!). So, this is a good market moment to cash in on leftover fear. I’m talking about dividends up to 9.7% that will benefit from the S&P 500 soaring towards 9000. (Yes, it sounds wild—but with record profits plus a declining dollar, this is a potential price target before the end of Trump 2.0.) Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversified Equity Income Fund (EXG) yields 9.2% and trades at a 6% discount. That’s a sweet deal because it holds big winners like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, then boosts income by selling covered calls on the S&P 500 and international indices. The income from these constantly expiring calls is the key to the EXG’s sky-high “synthetic yield.” The fund collects premiums from option buyers immediately after it writes these calls, generating steady income for shareholders. We can think of this as “renting” out positions to generate extra cash. EXG owns the underlying shares behind the S&P 500. Each month it leases its collection of stocks and collects the option premiums. Rinse and repeat. Nuveen S&P 500 Buy-Write Income Fund (BXMX) pays 8.1% and trades at a 9% discount to its net asset value (NAV)—another good deal because we’re talking Apple and Amazon for 91 cents on the dollar. Finally the Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD) dishes a 9.7% dividend. It is an ETF, so it trades at par (“fair value”), as most do. XYLD owns the S&P 500 stocks and has also written calls on the S&P 500 that expire later in June. When that happens, the fund will write new calls for July—delivering more tasty income to its investors. Covered Call Funds As sellers of covered calls, they exult in market volatility that delivers high option premiums. Plus, their NAVs have a tailwind—tech profits popping!

Title: Dan Ives' Wedbush ETF tracking AI stocks launches

Full Content:
Dan Ives, a tech analyst known for his bullish calls on Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), Tesla, and the generative AI boom, is offering investors a way to buy into his thesis — literally. On Tuesday, Wedbush Securities, where Ives is the managing director, launched the Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (ticker: IVES), a portfolio of 30 U.S. tech companies selected by Ives and his team for their exposure to AI. The fund trades on the NYSE Arca and carries a 0.75% expense ratio. The ETF includes familiar names such as Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%), Tesla (TSLA-3.33%), and Palantir (PLTR+1.01%) — companies Ives has championed as foundational to the next phase of digital transformation. The ETF tracks what Wedbush calls the “Ives AI 30,” a list of companies the company sees as best positioned to commercialize and scale AI across sectors — from semiconductors to cloud platforms to next-gen software. “It’s based on our research,” Ives told CNBC. “As new companies come in, then some companies could come out. This is a living organism, in terms of this AI 30. It’s not static. And that’s a key part of the theme here, because the theme will continue to evolve.” That puts the fund into what Wedbush executives say is a bit of a hybrid category. “We’re kind of walking this line between active and passive,” said Cullen Rogers, chief investment officer at Wedbush Fund Advisers, who is overseeing the ETFs day-to-day operations. “We’re just looking to leverage Dan’s ideas as well as we can in an institutional framework... that gives investors a consistent, predictable structure.” Ives has been among Wall Street’s most vocal AI bulls, describing the moment as a generational investment opportunity. In recent client notes, he’s called AI “the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years” and likened AI chips to “the new gold and oil.” “The AI revolution is the biggest tech theme we’ve ever seen,” Ives told Yahoo Finance. He said he started the ETF “because it’s about the second, third, fourth derivatives of AI playing out, and that’s the important thing for investors.” The launch lands at a time when AI-related stocks are surging. But whether or not the market stays this hot is a big question. “Dan’s track record speaks for itself,” Wedbush CEO Gary Wedbush said in a press release. “He’s been identifying the drivers of tech disruption for years, and the IVES ETF gives investors a chance to follow that insight in a disciplined, transparent way.” Wedbush is betting that the AI rally is far from over — and that the company’s strategy can stand out as the space matures.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is ‘motivated by fear and guilt,’ biographer says

Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang may run one of the most important companies in the world, but he can’t credit his success to the power of positive thinking. “I think the most surprising thing about Jensen is that he’s almost totally driven by negative emotions,” said Stephen Witt, who spent hours interviewing the Nvidia co-founder for his book, “The Thinking Machine.” “This is his fuel. This is his gasoline, [and it’s] what makes him go is this anxiety,” he told CNBC. According to Witt, Huang fears Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), which is valued at more than $3.3 trillion, could fall apart at any time. Witt said he was surprised by how much negative emotions seem to motivate Huang, who “becomes very uncomfortable and nervous when things are going well.” Huang does best when acting like Nvidia is “on the brink of failure at all times,” Witt said. “This is the narrative he generates around himself — that he could fail at any time and be disgraced. And this is what motivates him.” Witt continued: “Jensen, of course, is an obvious, huge go-getter, but it’s all coming from this place of almost beating himself up for not working hard enough all the time. I didn’t expect to see that.” While that mindset might sound exhausting, it has worked well for Huang, who according to Forbes, is the 16th richest person in the world in 2025. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 with two colleagues, and steered the company through an period where it almost had to close up shop just a few years later. Now, the chipmaker has never been more prolific. It reported $44.1 billion in revenue for the fiscal first quarter this year.

Title: Nvidia Stock Rises After Reclaiming Crown From Microsoft as World's Most Valuable Firm

Nvidia (NVDA) shares are rising in premarket trading Wednesday, a day after it overtook Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world’s most valuable company again. Nvidia shares are rising nearly 1% in premarket trading Wednesday, after it edged out Microsoft in market cap on Tuesday, closing up nearly 3% to $141.22 and putting the AI chipmaker’s value at $3.444 trillion. Microsoft’s market cap was $3.441 trillion at its close Tuesday. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple (AAPL) have been jostling to occupy the spot as the world’s most valuable company for nearly a year. They are the only companies to have ever achieved a market value of more than $3 trillion. Despite their gains, Nvidia’s market cap is still below its record of $3.66 trillion from earlier January when shares set their all-time high. Shares of Nvidia as well as others linked to the AI boom tumbled then when China's DeepSeek released a low-cost model that raised investor concerns about the future dominance of American AI firms. On Tuesday, Jefferies added Nvidia to its roster of “Franchise Picks,” touting the company as the “dominant supplier of AI accelerators” to data centers, facilities that house the advanced computers used to develop and train AI models.

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. The best growth stocks are well-run companies that innovate to create value for their customers. Many growth stocks lost value in the heat of the whiplash tariff announcements in early April.

These six best growth stocks have strong recent and projected sales and earnings per share (EPS) growth, plus conservative debt-to-equity (DTE) ratios.

The company also maintains a suite of software development tools. Customers include automotive OEMs, device manufacturers, cloud providers, internet companies and distributors. Nvidia has a dominant market share in AI-capable chips used in data centers. The company's products also have automotive, gaming, robotics and telecommunications applications. It’s commonplace to see Nvidia in a list of top growth stocks. The magnitude of the company's growth trajectory almost demands it. Since early 2023, Nvidia has increased annual sales from $26 billion to $130 billion, while its market cap has ballooned from $500 billion to $3.3 trillion. That happened after the company had raised annual sales by about 25% on average in the previous five years. AI adoption fueled this recent growth phase, but Nvidia has a long history of vision, innovation and execution—the trifecta of success factors in technology. While the biggest gains are already on the books, Nvidia isn’t likely to stop growing. The company has $53.7 billion of cash on its balance sheet, plus a savvy founder/CEO to keep competition at bay. For the first quarter 2026, Nvidia reported quarter-over-quarter sales growth of 69% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 27%. The results included a $4.5 billion charge resulting from changes in the U.S. government’s policy on chip sales to China. Analysts expect Nvidia to deliver 56% revenue growth and 50.7% EPS growth in fiscal 2026. Tradeweb builds and maintains investment trading marketplaces for stocks, bonds, credit, derivatives and other asset classes. The technology focus is on faster trades and data transparency. Clients are institutional investors and wealth managers. Tradeweb values its total addressable market at $8.9 trillion. With annual sales of $1.8 billion, the company owns only a sliver of the market. The largest opportunities are in ETFs and credit, where Tradeweb has 6% and 17% market share, respectively. The growth plan involves acquisitions and customer-driven technology innovation, particularly in rules-based trading. Tradeweb has expertise in automation. It launched its flagship Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) tool for U.S. Treasuries in 2012. As rules-based trading has become more popular, so has AiEX. The company is also incorporating AI to provide customers with advanced analytics before and after trades. For the first quarter 2025, Tradeweb reported quarter-over-quarter sales growth of 24.7% and diluted EPS growth of 16.9%. For the full year 2025, analysts expect sales and EPS increases of 23.3% and 51.6%, respectively. Monday.com builds and maintains software that business teams use to manage projects, collaborate, track sales leads and organize software development workflows. Customers include businesses, educational institutions and governments. Monday.com solutions fit in between overbuilt, expensive enterprise applications and off-the-shelf software that can’t fully address a team's unique workflows. The company's Work Operating System is a modular, customizable system clients can use to build the tools they need, without the expense and extended implementation timeline—two hallmarks of enterprise software. The functional, but robust product offering has propelled the company’s sales from $161 million in 2020 to $972 million last year. In that time, Monday.com has made strong progress moving up-market to a higher-dollar customer base, which is a key element of the growth strategy. While earnings just turned positive in 2024, Monday.com’s free cash flow in both 2023 and 2024 exceeded $200 million. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet, an ample source of growth funding. In its first quarter 2025 earnings release, Monday.com reported 30% quarter-over-quarter sales growth, 38% more customers worth $50,000-plus in annual sales and a non-GAAP operating margin of 14%. Analysts expect Monday.com to produce 28% sales growth and 523% EPS growth in 2025. Nova provides equipment, technology and solutions to help semiconductor manufacturers produce chips faster and more efficiently. The company specializes in dimensional metrology solutions, which provide precision size and shape measurements. Nova solutions address multiple stages of the semiconductor manufacturing lifecycle. Customers include leading integrated circuit manufacturers in Asia, Europe and North America. Semiconductor manufacturing is a thriving industry. According to a recent Deloitte report, 2024 semiconductor sales grew 19% to $627 billion. Expected 2025 sales are $697 billion, placing the industry on an easy pace to reach $1 trillion in sales by 2030 and $2 trillion by 2040. Nova’s role in helping manufacturers improve efficiency and output is critical to that growth. The company has an interesting mix of advantages: innovative technologies, a high-margin business model and ample growth opportunity. With that foundation, the leadership team is targeting $1 billion in sales by 2027. The 2027 outlook also includes a gross margin of 57% to 60%, R&D spend of 15% to 17% of sales and EPS close to $10—a 75% increase from the 2024 EPS of $5.75. For the first quarter, Nova reported 50% sales growth and 77% GAAP diluted EPS growth vs. the prior-year period. Analysts expect Nova to deliver sales growth of 30% and EPS growth of 49% in 2025. Krystal Biotech develops and sells genetic therapies treating rare diseases. In 2023, the company received FDA approval for Vyjuvek, the first treatment for the skin disorder dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB). Vyjuvek is now available in the U.S. and expanding globally. Krystal Biotech additionally has five active clinical programs addressing cystic fibrosis, solid tumors and another skin disorder, lamellar ichthyosis. Krystal Biotech focuses on identifying therapies for conditions with high unmet needs. As an example, before the U.S. launch of Vyjuvek, there was no treatment for DEB despite the severity of the disease. DEB is associated with recurring and chronic wounds that are costly to treat, as well as increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma. The company is also developing a treatment for Apha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), a disorder that precedes progressive lung disease. More than 250,000 patients worldwide have AATD. There is no cure and treatment options are limited. KRYS additionally has scalable, in-house manufacturing capacity to support Vyjuvek’s global expansion and other growth opportunities. Krystal Biotech began generating revenue in 2023. 2024 sales eclipsed $290 million, and EPS totaled $3 per share. Analysts expect 48.7% revenue growth and 104.3% EPS growth this year. Liquidity Services sells its clients' surplus assets on the world's largest B2B ecommerce network, via self-serve and fully managed auction offerings. Operating in more than 100 countries, the company has 5.7 million registered buyers and facilitates 1 million transactions annually. Liquidity Services adds value on three levels. Clients have an easy solution for liquidating unneeded assets, buyers have access to assets at liquidation pricing and landfills have less waste to process. The company also has an enviable client list spanning multiple industries and regions. Chevron, Shell, Sony, Volvo, P&G, Walmart and Amazon are among the names that LQDT services. The company values its addressable market at over $130 billion, which it breaks down into five sectors: Liquidity Services has regularly increased its gross merchandise volume and revenue since fiscal 2021. In its most recent quarter, LQDT reported sales growth of 27% and GAAP diluted EPS growth of 22%. Analysts expect a 35% revenue increase and a 99% increase in EPS in fiscal 2025. Bottom Line Growth stocks can move fast, up and down. Opt for well-run companies that innovate to create value for their customers. Those qualities help growth players thrive in good times and survive in bad ones.

Title: Nvidia Added to Jefferies 'Franchise Picks'

Jefferies has added Nvidia (NVDA) to its roster of “Franchise Picks,” a group its analysts describe as “our highest-conviction, Buy-rated stocks.” In Nvidia’s case, the reason for conviction is the chipmaker’s position as the “dominant supplier of AI accelerators” to data centers, facilities that house the advanced computers used to develop and train artificial intelligence models. Jefferies came away from Nvidia’s quarterly results impressed with the chipmaker’s revenue projections—which largely mirrored what analysts expected despite a larger-than-expected impact from U.S. export curbs. Nvidia said it expects to take an $8 billion hit this quarter due to lost revenue from sales of H20 chips, which the Trump administration barred from being sold in China. The analysts pointed to the “massive step up” in AI commitments from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as a reason for revenue optimism. Last month, Nvidia agreed to supply chips to Saudi AI startup Humain, while the U.S. and UAE reached a deal allowing the Middle Eastern nation to import American-made AI chips. Nvidia, grappling with Microsoft (MSFT) for the title of the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization at more than $3.4 trillion, traded 2% higher shortly after the opening bell Tuesday. The stock has gained roughly 5% so far in 2025.
