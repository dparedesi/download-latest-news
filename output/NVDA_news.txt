Title: Could Intel's Next Big Investment Come From Apple?

Intel has reportedly set its sights on a deal with Apple, a move that could further boost the struggling chipmaker. Shares of Intel (INTC) surged over 6% Wednesday following a Bloomberg report that it's solicited support from the iPhone maker. Neither company responded to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication. Shares of Apple fell less than 1%. Wall Street analysts broadly believe Intel likely needs more funds and foundry commitments from customers to succeed with its turnaround plan. Investments from Nvidia and the U.S. government have helped that process along, and one from Apple would mark another step. The stock has clambered higher this year, but it's well off past highs, a reminder that there's plenty of work yet to do. With Wednesday's gains, Intel's stock has added a quarter of its value in the week since Intel announced a $5 billion investment from and chip-development partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). The raft of events have excited investors, with the Nvidia news seen as a vote of confidence from the world's most valuable company. Still, the stock remains well off its highs, with most Wall Street analysts tracked by Visible Alpha sticking by "hold" ratings while waiting for evidence of more business for Intel's foundry, which makes chips for other firms and which is central to maintaining support from the U.S. government—itself now a major shareholder. A deal with Apple could help Intel's case, particularly if it came with foundry commitments. Nvidia's did not, raising speculation about whether a foundry deal could come later or whether the lack of one underscored Intel's challenges in convincing customers. "If Intel can prove they can deliver they will have customers lined up around the block," Bernstein analysts wrote last week. "If they can’t, no customer in their right mind will put any meaningful volume there." New partners might also see a deal with Intel as a way to gain political goodwill, Bernstein said. That may hold some appeal to former Intel customer Apple, which has shown some signs of inroads with the Trump administration, last month winning pledges of tariff exemptions based on its recent investments in U.S. manufacturing.

Reduced forecasts for copper and gold sales weighed on a big mining stock, while shares of a semiconductor giant made another push higher after an industry peer offered a bright outlook. Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground for a second consecutive session Wednesday, reflecting pressure on the tech sector and despite outperformance from energy names. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost around 0.3%, while the Dow ended 0.4% lower. Read here for Investopedia's comprehensive market coverage. Intel (INTC) stock jumped 6.4%, lifted by an afternoon report from Bloomberg that the company had discussed Apple (AAPL) buying a stake. The latest move higher for shares of the chipmaking giant also came after Micron Technology (MU) raised it outlook for PCs and traditional servers, two of Intel's key markets. Intel stock has gained more than 25% over the past month amid a string of high-profile investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank (SFTBY), and Nvidia (NVDA). Micron's stock fell nearly 3%, while Apple's was off less than 1%. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) shares tumbled 17%, more than any other stock in the S&P 500 on, after the mining giant lowered its forecasts for quarterly copper and gold sales. Issues at Freeport's Indonesia unit weighed on its outlook; .the company declared force majeure at its Grasberg mine after a mud flow partially blocked access to the underground facility, resulting in fatal injuries to two workers. Shares of Axon Enterprise (AXON) fell 10% after the provider of less-lethal weapons and other law enforcement technology announced the acquisition of Prepared, an emergency communications platform powered by artificial intelligence. Needham analysts reiterated their "buy" rating on Axon stock but noted the complexities involved in a potential return to the computer-aided dispatch market. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Axon stock with a bullish "overweight" rating. Xcel Energy (XEL) said it agreed to settle litigation related to the devastating 2021 Marshall Fire in Colorado. Although the electric utility reaffirmed its belief that its equipment did not cause the fire, it will pay roughly $640 million to settle lawsuits involving more than 4,000 plaintiffs who sued for damages. Xcel Energy shares rose 6.7%, logging the benchmark index's top performance in the midweek trading session. Shares of health insurer Centene (CNC) gained 5.8%. Centene's managed health subsidiary Meridian Health of Illinois said it paid providers $15 million in value-based care incentives for improving health outcomes for its Medicaid members. Reductions in emergency room visits and inpatient readmissions under this initiative bode well for Centene's goal of reining in medical costs. Makers of agricultural chemicals received a boost following reports that a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is pushing for a resolution that could stabilize fertilizer markets. More than 60 members of Congress reportedly signed a letter requesting that Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum add phosphate to the U.S. Critical Minerals List, a move that could help bolster domestic production of key crop nutrients. Shares of Mosaic (MOS) and CF Industries Holdings (CF) were up 5.8% and 5.2%, respectively.

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Nvidia's $100B investment in OpenAI, linked to $350B in chip sales, raises circular financing concerns, drawing parallels to Cisco's risky dot-com era vendor lending.OpenAI's $1 trillion data center ambition heavily relies on Nvidia's investment, securing vital chip supplies for AI growth, though potentially at lower margins for Nvidia.The AI hardware sector, led by Nvidia, is experiencing a significant boom, with its segment of the Generative AI Stock Index surging 403%, driving overall market growth. Nvidia shares are up 29% this year and 1,124% since the beginning of 2023. The company’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI raised questions about whether that rally would continue, according to the New York Times. The most fundamental question is this: Is Nvidia using its own money – investments in Open AI, CoreWeave and others – to fuel growing demand for the company’s graphics processing units? This brings back memories of the dot-com boom when Cisco Systems provided financing to startups to fuel growth in demand for the company’s networking equipment. Through its Cisco Capital arm, the company lent billions to money-losing telecom firms to buy Cisco’s products. In the late 1990s, Cisco regularly reported 40% to 60% revenue growth and by 2000, 10% of the company’s $20 billion in revenue was attributable to such financing and leasing deals. When the dot-bubble burst in 2001, Cisco set aside $900 million in reserves for bad loans to those customers, reported the Los Angeles Times, and tightened its lending standards. To be sure, if Nvidia's investments do not pay off, the GPU designer will not need to write off bad loans as Cisco did – but it could mark down the value of those investments on its balance sheet. In the meantime, all of these investments make Nvidia and Open AI the lead companies in a V-shaped forward migration of AI technology providers. Other segments of the industry – including chip makers and their suppliers, data center technology and energy providers, database companies, and many others, noted my book Brain Rush – are benefiting from this ongoing boom as evidenced by the 157% rise in my Generative AI Stock Index (compared to a 116% rise in the Nasdaq). OpenAI is planning to build $1 trillion worth of data centers – $300 billion worth will be supplied with help from Oracle and another $100 billion from the Nvidia deal, reported the Wall Street Journal. "Everything starts with compute," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. "Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale." If OpenAI – which last fall said it expected to lose $44 billion through 2029, noted the Journal – can find the cash to finance these data centers, the industry will keep expanding. That may keep shares of Nvidia, Oracle, and many other participants in the AI ecosystem rising. If not, look out below. An Nvidia spokesperson declined my request to comment. Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI in $10 billion chunks. For every gigawatt of Nvidia-supported data centers OpenAI builds, Nvidia will invest $10 billion. For every $10 billion Nvidia invests, OpenAI will spend $35 billion on Nvidia chips, according to New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu whose work was featured in The Economist. OpenAI will pay for the chips through a blend of 71% in cash and 29% stock, noted NewStreet Research. One worrisome aspect of this deal is its lower margins for Nvidia. “That arrangement reduces Nvidia’s typical margins for cutting-edge chips,” wrote the Journal, while the chip designer will benefit from ensuring steady GPU demand. This deal also lowers OpenAI’s cost of capital due to Nvidia’s relatively sterling credit rating. Prior to this deal, OpenAI bought thousands of Nvidia’s chips through cloud service providers and neo-clouds – which buy chips and develop data center clusters – “renting them out at a premium,” the Journal reported. These data center builders borrow money to finance their operations. Data center deals associated with money-losing companies such as OpenAI were financed at interest rates as high as 15%; whereas the interest rates for deals backed by Microsoft ranged from 6% to 9%, the Journal wrote. Nvidia – which generated $72 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters – seems to have ample interest free funds for financing its Open AI deal. It remains to be seen whether the chip designer will fund all $100 billion of its OpenAI commitment. Mark Twain reportedly said history does not repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes. Will Nvidia’s huge bets on money-losing companies such as OpenAI rhyme with Cisco’s aggressive lending to unprofitable telecom service providers? It is too early to tell. However, Cisco’s lending during the dot-com boom “highlights the lengths to which one of the darlings of Wall Street would go to keep reporting revenue increases,” noted the Los Angeles Times. For Cisco, a key question was whether the company booked revenue for these financing deals too soon. In some of the company’s deals, such as those of American Metrocomm and Digital Broadband Communications, Cisco recorded sales only when the customers began repaying the loans, the Los Angeles Times wrote. In other cases, such as Rhythms NetConnections – an Englewood, Colo. based Internet access provider owned by a then-major Cisco shareholder Bill Stensrud – “Cisco booked sales at the outset -- even before a penny had been collected and even when the customers were teetering toward a bankruptcy filing,” reported the Los Angeles Times. Rhythms was unprofitable – reporting a loss of $36 million on $1 million in 1998 sales. But Cisco shipped $20 million of its equipment to Rhythms prior to the company’s April 1999 IPO. By August 2001, Rhythms had filed for bankruptcy leaving $30 million in unpaid debt to Cisco, according to the Los Angeles Times. By 2003, Cisco was chastened. “Cisco recognized that there were risks involved” in its earlier strategy, the company said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times, “but the decision to proceed was made for sound business reasons and based on analysis of the facts that existed at the time.” An economist who studied the telecom industry and reviewed documents about Cisco’s lending practices reached a sobering conclusion. By making loans to so many distressed companies, “these guys were operating under a fallacy,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jerry Hausman told the Los Angeles Times. For a company to increase sales this way, he added, it’s like “you’re pumping yourself up on steroids,” Hausman added. The takeaway? Investors should keep a close watch on how much of Nvidia’s revenue is coming from customers in which the chip designer has invested. Moreover, it’s worth investigating the accounting policies for recognizing revenue from such deals and quantifying their value on Nvidia’s balance sheet. When Nvidia announced its investment in OpenAI, shares in other technology providers rose as well. Other stocks – notably Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, memory supplier SK Hynix, STMicro, Infineon and BE Semiconductor – gained ground, reported CNBC. My Generative AI Stock Index, about which I wrote in a June 2014 Forbes post, aims to capture the stock market performance of companies in the following industry segments: Overall, the GAISI has risen 157% between the beginning of January 2023 – the month ChatGPT reached 100 million subscribers – and September 24, 2025. Here is the average return for the four segments of the industry value network during that period: The top performing industry segment was generative AI hardware – of which Nvidia (+1,124%) and liquid cooling provider Vertiv (1,012%) – were the leading stocks. The worst performing sector was AI consulting – of which Gartner dropped most – down 23%. Analysts gave mixed opinions about Nvidia’s investment. The good news is the investment assures things get built; the bad news is 'circularity’ – which I interpret to mean Nvidia is buying its own products through a third-party. “On the one hand this helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Reuters. “On the other hand the 'circular’ concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further,” Rasgon added. Several analysts see the deal adding between $400 billion and $500 billion to Nvidia’s revenue. For example, “We estimate this deal ultimately translates into ~$400B of NVDA revenue over a multi-year period,” UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note Monday, reported Barron’s. Another analyst shares Rasgon’s concerns about circularity and sees both Nvidia and OpenAI being better off. “So Nvidia has the demand for the chips, but are also investing, hoping that OpenAI itself becomes a good investment,” Creative Strategies CEO Ben Bajarin told the Times. Circularity has led to problems in prior tech booms. If OpenAI can keep convincing investors to provide more capital, Nvidia has a chance of reporting better-than-expected results. Otherwise, AI could become a bubble that bursts.

Title: Bitcoin Miner IREN Has 80% Potential Upside Thanks to Big Bet on AI Cloud: Bernstein

IREN (IREN), one of the largest self-operated BTC$108,987.13 miners in the U.S., is breaking away from the pack, and Wall Street is taking notice. Bernstein analysts raised their price target on IREN to $75 from $20, implying about 80% upside, as the miner doubles down on building its own AI cloud business rather than relying on co-location deals with partners like CoreWeave (CRWV). IREN has already had a major move, ahead more than eight-fold from its 52-week low of $5.13 hit in April. The shares are higher by 365% year-over-year. The broker now sees IREN’s AI pivot as credible, despite early skepticism about the miner’s ability to execute on a capital-intensive data center build-out and compete with AI cloud players tied to hyperscalers and Nvidia (NVDA). IREN is guiding for rapid growth, the report noted, with $500 million in annual recurring revenue by Q1 2026 on 23,300 GPUs, up from roughly $14 million in Q1 2025. Beyond AI, IREN retains flexibility with its 3 gigawatt (GW) power portfolio, balancing bitcoin mining and AI workloads to maximize revenue per megawatt, Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Its 50 EH/s mining operation generates an estimated $600 million in annualized EBITDA at current bitcoin prices, funding its AI expansion, according to the analysts. Bernstein has shifted its valuation approach to a sum-of-parts model, assigning 87% of enterprise value to AI cloud and co-location potential at IREN’s 2GW West Texas site, with the remaining 13% coming from bitcoin mining. At the revised target, IREN would trade at $7.5 million per megawatt (MW), above other AI-focused miners but still far below established data center peers like CoreWeave, suggesting further room for multiple expansion, the report added.

Title: Watch These Micron Stock Price Levels After Memory Chip Maker Reports Strong Earnings

Time Published: 2025-09-24T12:45:36Z
Full Content:
Micron (MU) shares were little changed in premarket trading Wednesday after the memory chip maker posted better-than-expected quarterly results and issued a rosy forecast amid surging AI-related demand. The company said late Tuesday it expects to generate fiscal first-quarter revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion. The midpoint of that range comes in well ahead of the $11.94 billion expected by analysts, with the guidance driven by booming demand for the company’s high-bandwidth memory chips and favorable pricing dynamics. Heading into the earnings report, the Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) partner's shares had nearly doubled since the start of the year and surged 40% in September. The gains have been fueled by customers investing billions in AI chips to build data centers tasked with powering increasingly memory-intensive applications. The stock was down 0.2% at around $166 in recent premarket trading. Below, we use technical analysis to identify important post-earnings price levels worth watching out for. After finding support near the 50-day moving average, Micron shares trended sharply higher before consolidating in a pennant pattern over the past week. While this month’s strong uptrend has coincided with the relative strength index crossing into overbought territory, the indicator remains below its June peak, signaling that the stock has further room to climb. During Wednesday’s trading session, it’s worth watching out for a breakout above the pennant, a move that would indicate a continuation of the recent bullish move. Let’s turn to Micron’s chart to forecast an upside price target and also identify important support levels amid the possibility for earnings-related volatility. If a post-earnings breakout move occurs, investors can use bars pattern analysis to project an upside target. When applying the technique to Micron’s chart, we take the price bars comprising the strong move higher this month and reposition them from the pennant pattern’s top trendline. This forecasts a target of around $240, 44% above Tuesday’s closing price. We selected this earlier trend to predict how a continuation move higher may play out on the chart if the stock has a similar bullish upward leg. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially keep a close eye on the $155 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the base of the pennant pattern and a brief pause in the stock’s strong uptrend earlier this month. Finally, selling below this level could spark a fall toward $129. Investors may seek to accumulate Micron shares in this location near the June and August peaks, which currently sit just above the upward sloping 50-day MA.

Title: Alibaba Shares Jump on Plan to Boost AI Spending Beyond $53B

China’s top tech firm is spending even more than it originally planned on AI, turning up the heat on U.S. chip giants like Nvidia (NVDA) in the race to dominate the technology. Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) CEO Eddie Wu reportedly said Wednesday that the Chinese company has raised its AI budget to more than the $53 billion three-year outlay it announced in February. The spending plan marks the latest push by a tech firm to invest big in AI, the technology that has fueled U.S. stock markets to hit record highs. Nvidia said earlier this week it plans to invest up to $100 billion in ChatGPT owner OpenAI. “We are vigorously advancing a three-year, 380 billion [yuan] AI infrastructure initiative with plans to sustain and further increase our investment according to our strategic vision in anticipation of the [artificial superintelligence] era,” Wu said at Alibaba Cloud’s annual flagship technology conference, according to CNBC. The boom in AI spending by tech firms has helped propel the U.S. stock market to record highs this year. American tech firms are a big reason for this, but increasing spending on AI in China—by Alibaba and rivals like Baidu—is also behind this spending, and comments today from Alibaba's CEO indicate that it could continue. Wu has said he sees companies globally spending around $4 trillion globally on AI over the next five years, and “Alibaba needs to keep up,” Bloomberg said. Alibaba shares have more than doubled so far this year, as co-founder Jack Ma returned to Beijing's fold and the ecommerce giant doubled down on its "AI first strategy." On Wednesday, they rose 9% in intraday trading. Adding to the investor optimism, Cathie Wood's funds bought Alibaba shares, according to a daily trading report from her Ark Investment Management. Bloomberg noted it was the star fund manager's first purchase in the Chinese company in four years. Alibaba didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Stock futures are edging higher after major indexes snapped a three-day streak of record highs; Micron Technology (MU) shares are in focus after the chipmaker posted record revenue on strong AI demand; Stable coin issuer Tether is reportedly seeking funding that would value the company at $500 billion; shares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) are surging on its AI spending plans; and Lithium Americas (LAC) stock is soaring on a report that the U.S. government seeks to own a stake in the mining firm. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are higher this morning after the market lost ground yesterday following comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who said the central bank faces challenges in determining interest rates as the labor market weakens while inflation remains elevated. Futures associated with the benchmark S&P 500, the tech-focused Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are pointing to a slightly higher opens for each of the major indexes. Gold futures, which have hit a series of record highs recently, ticked lower to around $3,800 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects a wide range of consumer loans, was little changed at 4.13%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was at $113,100 recently, up from an overnight low of around $111,000. Memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) posted record quarterly sales and delivered an optimistic outlook on surging demand for AI hardware. Micron reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.03 on revenue that jumped 46% year-over-year to $11.32 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, both above estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The partner to Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.41 to $3.71 on revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion in the fiscal first quarter, also ahead of expectations. Shares of Micron, which have nearly doubled year-to-date, were down 1% in recent premarket trading. Stable coin issuer Tether is reportedly seeking to raise as much as $20 billion in private investment in a deal that could put the cryptocurrency firm’s value on par with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Bloomberg reported that the El Salvador-based company is looking to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion in exchange for a 3% stake. The deal could see the company valued at $500 billion. In a social media post, CEO Paolo Ardoino said the funding would help scale by “several orders of magnitude” the firm’s business lines, which also included AI, commodity trading, energy, communications and media. Shares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) surged after a report that the firm plans to boost its AI spending. Bloomberg reported that CEO Eddie Wu said the company would ramp up AI spending beyond the original plan announced in February of around $53 billion, as overall spending on the technology worldwide is expected to reach $4 trillion over the next five years. The company will invest in the development of AI models and infrastructure, including plans to build data centers in Brazil, France and the Netherlands, the report said. U.S.-traded shares of Alibaba were up more than 8% ahead of the opening bell. Shares of Lithium Americas (LAC) soared in premarket trading on a report that the Trump administration may seek a stake in the mining company as part of a government loan deal. Reuters reported that the government may ask for a 10% stake in Lithium Americas as a condition in renegotiation talks over a $2.26 billion Energy Department loan for its Thacker Pass lithium project with General Motors (GM). Lithium is used to make electric vehicle batteries and other key electronic equipment. The move would come after the Trump administration took a similar stake in chipmaker Intel (INTC). Shares of Lithium Americas were up 70% in recent premarket trading, while GM gained more than 2%.

Micron Technology (MU) shares climbed in extended trading Tuesday after the memory chip maker posted record quarterly sales, boosted by surging demand for AI hardware. The Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) partner's shares were up over 2% in after-hours trading. They've nearly doubled in value in 2025 through Tuesday's close. The memory chip maker reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.03 on revenue that jumped 46% year-over-year to a record $11.32 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter. Both figures topped analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha as Micron's data center business grew. As a memory supplier for leading artificial intelligence chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Micron stands to benefit from the same trends and its results can be taken as a positive sign for the AI trade. “In fiscal 2025, we achieved all-time highs across our data center business and are entering fiscal 2026 with strong momentum and our most competitive portfolio to date. As the only U.S.-based memory manufacturer, Micron is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the AI opportunity ahead," said CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Looking ahead, Micron said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.41 to $3.71 on revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion in the fiscal first quarter, ahead of consensus projections.

US stock market retreated today after hitting record highs recently, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.53% to around 6,658 and the Nasdaq falling nearly 1% amid a selloff in Nvidia shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also dipped 0.19%, closing near 46,293. Nvidia's shares dropped about 2.8% a day after announcing a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which had initially boosted its stock and lifted the market. Micron Technology bucked the trend by jumping on strong fiscal fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by robust AI-related demand. Wall Street stepped back from record territory on Tuesday, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that stocks are “fairly highly valued” and signaled caution on further rate cuts.

Title: MRVL Stock vs. NVIDIA

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Marvell Technology stock recently jumped 12% in a single week, driven by growing optimism about its custom AI accelerators and optical sensitivity chips. This performance raises a key question for investors: how does Marvell now compare to its peer, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)? NVIDIA presents superior revenue growth in key periods, enhanced profitability, and a comparatively lower valuation compared to Marvell Technology, indicating that investing in NVDA may be more advantageous. See how Marvell’s financials compare with its peers, including NVIDIA. MRVL designs and markets analog, mixed-signal, digital, and embedded integrated circuits, providing Ethernet solutions and storage controllers for HDDs and SSDs that support multiple system interfaces. NVDA supplies graphics, computing, and networking solutions for gaming, visualization, data centers, and automotive sectors, alongside a strategic partnership with Kroger Co. See further revenue details: See further margin details: However, do these figures provide the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock to determine if NVIDIA’s advantage is sustainable or if Marvell Technology still has strategies to deploy (see Buy or Sell MRVL Stock). This is one perspective on evaluating stocks. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Regardless of how appealing the numbers are, stock investing is never without its bumps. There’s risk involved that must be considered. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses and MRVL Dip Buyer Analyses to see how these stocks experienced declines and recoveries in past occurrences. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nvidia Stock Price Levels to Watch After Chip Giant's $100 Billion Deal With OpenAI

Nvidia (NVDA) shares lost ground in early trading Tuesday after logging their largest one-day percentage gain since July on news the AI Favorite plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. Under the deal, Nvidia will supply OpenAI with its next-generation Vera Rubin platform to help the ChatGPT maker build data centers and other AI infrastructure with a capacity of at least 10 gigawatts of power. The companies said they anticipate finalizing the details of the partnership in the coming weeks. Nvidia shares were down 2% at around $180 in recent trading after surging nearly 4% on Monday. Through yesterday's close, the stock had gained 37% so far in 2025, handily outpacing broader market returns over the period. Investors have piled into the stock as big tech hyperscalers and sovereign customers invest heavily in the company’s products as they ramp up their AI capacity. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for. After setting their record high last month, Nvidia shares consolidated within a symmetrical triangle before breaking out from the pattern in Monday’s trading session. The breakout indicates a continuation of the stock’s extended move higher, with increasing volume in recent days signaling conviction from larger market participants. It’s also worth noting that the relative strength index has moved back into bullish territory, confirming strengthening price momentum. Let’s identify two potential bullish price targets to watch on Nvidia’s chart amid the potential for follow-through buying and also point out key support levels worth monitoring during future retracements. Investors can use the measured move technique, also known as the measuring principle, to forecast an initial price target if the stock climbs to a new all-time high. This works by calculating the percentage change between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near their widest section and adding it to the pattern’s top trendline value. For example, in this case, we apply a 16% increase to $179, which projects a target of $207.64, about 13% above Monday’s closing price. To forecast a longer-term price target, investors can use bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior trends to forecast future directional movements. When applying the technique to Nvidia’s chart, we take the stock’s trending move higher from May to August and overlay it from Monday’s breakout point. This forecasts a potential price target of around $255, implying nearly 40% upside from yesterday’s close. This prior rally accelerated after breaking out above the 200-day moving average (MA), potentially providing clues as to how a new trend higher may evolve after Monday’s decisive breakout above the 50-day MA. Investors should initially monitor the $165 level during future pullbacks. This location could provide support near a trendline that links a series of price action on the chart stretching back to early July. Finally, a larger drawdown in the stock opens the door for a retest of lower support around $150. Investors could look for buy-and-hold opportunities in this region near multiple peaks that formed on Nvidia’s chart between November last year and January this year.
