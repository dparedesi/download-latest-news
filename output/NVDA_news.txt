(Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), a prominent supplier of equipment for chip fabrication, is poised to gain from the increasing capital expenditures driven by the burgeoning generative artificial intelligence industry. While AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) grabs attention with its stock price soaring more than 3 times over the last two years and its valuation approaching $4 trillion, less known companies like Lam play an essential role in the manufacturing of the AI chips that Nvidia markets. These stocks may provide a more stable value with significant potential for upside. The data is persuasive. According to SEMI, capital expenditure on advanced chip-making equipment is expected to nearly double from 2023 to 2028, and global capex spending is anticipated to exceed $100 billion in 2025 alone. Lam, which focuses on deposition and etching equipment—two of the foremost processes in chip production—may be well-positioned to seize a substantial portion of this investment. The company’s primary clients include industry titans like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel, establishing it as a key player in both the logic and memory sectors of the chip market. Although traditionally dominant in memory chips, Lam is broadening its footprint in advanced logic chips and packaging technologies—fields that are witnessing increasing demand as chip design complexity escalates. AI tasks require not just advanced processing power but also high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and intricate stacking architectures. For instance, the fabrication of HBM chips is three times more wafer-intensive than standard DRAM because of lower bit density and the requirement for 3D stacking. This results in a direct increase in demand for tools manufactured by companies like Lam. Whereas chip designers such as Nvidia have experienced skyrocketing valuations, Lam's stock has lagged. Shares have decreased by approximately 9% over the past 12 months and presently trade at around 24 times forward earnings, while Nvidia trades at about 35 times. Indeed, the valuation disparity is partly attributable to Lam’s reliance on China, which represented 31% of revenues in the March quarter. Ongoing U.S. export restrictions have impacted this segment, likely restricting Lam's capacity to capitalize on the substantial Chinese market. According to consensus estimates, Lam's revenues are projected to grow by around 22% in FY25, although growth is expected to cool to roughly 2% in FY’26, in part due to these China-related challenges, with earnings also expected to remain flat. Nonetheless, if heightened demand related to AI, combined with a possible relaxation of chip equipment export restrictions to China, leads to sustained revenue growth at FY’25 rates of about 22% annually over the next three years, Lam's revenue could increase by around 1.8 times. Even if profit margins stay near current levels of 27% (as recorded over the first nine months of FY25), and if the valuation multiple rises to about 30 times (up from 24 times currently, a 1.25 times growth), the stock could potentially double from the current price of approximately $97 to over $200 per share. Several scenarios could lead to this outcome. Last week, the U.S. and China established a trade framework that encompasses rare earth exports and a potential relaxation of technology restrictions. If this easing of tensions applies to chip equipment exports, companies like Lam might gain renewed access to a vital growth market, further enhancing revenues. Furthermore, the process of chip manufacturing is becoming increasingly capital-intensive, meaning that a larger portion of the chip's expense is now equipment-related—a distinct advantage for companies like Lam. Additionally, advanced packaging methods, such as stacking and connecting multiple chips, which are already being used for AI tasks, should boost the demand for Lam’s high-end machinery. Certainly, Lam faces significant risks. Beyond the China issue, the memory chip arena, where Lam has historically excelled, is encountering pricing pressures. Flash memory prices have been declining due to decreased demand from consumer markets and capex in this sector has been subdued as key players reduce production. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, and U.S. tariffs could further obscure Lam’s short-term growth prospects. Although Lam is a highly specialized company with robust intellectual property, it may not enjoy the same protective barrier as a firm like ASML, which essentially has a monopoly over its trade of extreme ultraviolet lithography. On the other hand, Lam faces numerous competitors, such as Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron, which also provide similar services. That said, the long-term upcycle appears to be secure. The global semiconductor market is forecasted to surpass $1 trillion in annual revenue by 2030, rising from approximately $624 billion in 2024 according to the Wall Street Journal. As chip manufacturers adopt next-generation technologies to enable AI, the demand for sophisticated manufacturing tools is likely to remain high, directly benefiting Lam. While investing in a single stock like LRCX entails risk, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), delivering robust returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered an adaptive means to maximize the advantages of favorable market conditions while curbing losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

The feature from tokenization firm Backed, rolled out on centralized exchanges Kraken and Bybit this week in certain regions and also launched natively on the Solana blockchain, allows traders to gain exposure to popular American equities like Meta, Netflix, Coinbase, McDonald’s, and more on-chain. In other words, eligible users can swap crypto or fiat for stocks on the aforementioned exchanges, or swap any Solana token for the xStock of their choosing via decentralized protocols like Jupiter or Raydium. still can't believe you can now swap between fartcoin and USA stocks, permissionlessly, across the globe with just an internet connection and a solana wallet internet capital markets pic.twitter.com/8Mmyy47dnz — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) June 30, 2025 While tokenized stocks, or the process of putting shares of companies on-chain, is not a new idea, xStocks differs from previous implementations that simply reflected the price of an off-chain asset with a “mirrored” asset on-chain. Instead, each xStock token is backed 1:1 by the underlying asset which is held by a regulated third-party. In other words, a user that purchases a share of Apple on-chain via xStocks is assured that their single share of Apple is held in custody and redeemable at any time. “For the first time, people all over the world can own and use a share of a tokenized stock like they would use money. You can move it, hold it, spend it, or borrow against it. All from your wallet, with no intermediaries, no borders and no delays,” said Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi in a statement about the platform’s xStock launch. According to Backed, trading tokenized stocks like xStocks offers a handful of benefits that users trading via a traditional brokerage would not get. For example, xStocks allows users to trade 24/7, while a brokerage is subject to the stock market’s hours. Additionally, their use on global blockchains allows participants in other geographies to gain exposure to the American stock market, and for trades to take place without broker commissions. It also makes equities available for use in decentralized finance (DeFi). While Kraken and Bybit have tapped Backed and its xStocks product for its tokenized equities, other platforms are looking to build their own tokenized product suites. Coinbase has been seeking regulatory approval to offer tokenized stocks on its platform, with its Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal calling that approval a “huge priority” in June. Furthermore, Robinhood announced Monday that it is rolling out tokenized stock trading to its European users, allowing them to trade U.S.-listed stocks via Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum. The firm also plans to launch its own dedicated layer-2 blockchain powered by Arbitrum, and migrate the service to that chain.

Bitcoin slid on Tuesday as weakness in U.S. tech stocks appeared to spill over into crypto markets. The crypto asset fell about 1% over the past 24 hours, trading at $106,175 at press time as traders took profits after ending June above the $107,000 for its highest-ever monthly close. Sentiment equally soured in equities with shares of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) both taking heavy losses, dragging the Nasdaq lower by about 0.6% — a pattern that often weighs on digital assets. Tesla was lower by 5.4% in afternoon trade after the Donald Trump/Elon Musk spat re-erupted alongside the momentum for passage of the GOP's spending bill. Major altcoins including Solana SOL$150.54, Cardano ADA$0.5814 and Avalanche AVAX$18.08 posted steep declines, adding to a broader downturn across the crypto space. SOL led the way with a 6% decline following yesterday's spike higher on news of imminent launch of an ETF. Speaking in Europe at an ECB event, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell repeated recent comments about the U.S. economy being in a good spot, thus allowing for patience as the central bank mulls the idea of rate cuts. Powell's comments Tuesday were of particular import given what's now a clear split between him and at least two other Fed members, both of whom would like to see a July rate cut on the table. Powell did allow that a rate cut this month isn't off the table, but gave little indication he's considering easing policy in July. Thanks to the July 4 holiday, the government's employment report for June will be released on Thursday this week. Economists are expecting jobs to have grown by 110,000 in June versus 139,000 the previous month. A sizable delta below that 110,000 level could quickly change sentiment about the Fed's July decision.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. In a period marked by investor caution in the U.S. tech sector, Broadcom Inc. AVGO stands out with a 63% stock rally in just three months. Let’s unpack the compelling narrative behind Broadcom’s exceptional outperformance, delving into its strong second-quarter 2025 results, positive analyst sentiment, and future outlook. Broadcom, a dominant force in the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) market, focuses on high-performance computing, networking, and storage applications. The company designs and manufactures custom silicon chips for specific tasks, offering high-speed computing, networking, and data center infrastructure advantages. Broadcom’s stock increased by 63% in the last three months, while the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX), which includes Broadcom, gained 30% during the same period. Also Read: Nvidia, Broadcom Lead Fund Manager Buys Even As Semiconductor Sector Cools: Analysts This performance comes even as the U.S. tech sector navigates investor apprehension regarding the sustainability of substantial AI investments by tech giants and the implications of the Trump administration’s tariff policies. Currently, AVGO trades near its 52-week high of approximately $276. Analysts generally hold a positive outlook on Broadcom, with a consensus price forecast of $387.68 based on ratings from 29 analysts. The highest target is $1950, issued by Bernstein on June 13, 2024. The three most recent analyst ratings were released by Citigroup, Barclays, and Susquehanna in June 2025. Broadcom’s second-quarter 2025 revenue reached $15 billion, a 20% increase year-over-year, driven by its AI semiconductor solutions and VMware. This revenue figure slightly exceeded analyst estimates of $14.99 billion. The company’s quarterly AI revenue grew 46% to over $4.4 billion, attributed to demand for AI networking. Broadcom generated approximately $6.56 billion in cash from operations and $6.41 billion in free cash flow during the quarter. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $1.58 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.56. For the third quarter, Broadcom expects revenue of approximately $15.8 billion, aligning with estimates of $15.79 billion. It anticipates AI semiconductor revenue to reach $5.1 billion in the third quarter. These results prompted analysts to adjust price targets for the stock, citing growth in AI-related revenue and demand for networking solutions. JP Morgan’s Harlan Sur noted Broadcom’s potential for long-term AI revenue growth, supported by increased capital expenditures from major cloud firms and the adoption of its custom ASIC silicon. Rosenblatt’s Kevin Cassidy highlighted Broadcom’s visibility into AI growth through key XPU customers and the company’s Ethernet scale-up adoption for LLM training and inference. Cantor Fitzgerald’s Matthew Prisco projects AI semiconductor revenue to exceed $20 billion in 2025 and $30 billion in 2026. Broadcom’s stock has dramatically outpaced its peers, with a 68% surge over the last 12 months compared to the PHLX Semiconductor’s modest 1.3%. In the first half of 2025, Broadcom gained 19% outpacing the S&P 500 gain of 6% and Nasdaq’s 15.5%. The year 2024 was particularly significant, as Broadcom joined the exclusive “trillion-dollar valuation club,” alongside Nvidia Corp. NVDA, fueled by the intensifying AI frenzy. In fiscal year 2024, Broadcom’s revenue reached an impressive $51.6 billion, marking a 44% increase. Semiconductor revenue contributed $30.1 billion, with AI revenue alone soaring 220% to $12.2 billion, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. The integration of VMware significantly boosted infrastructure software revenue to $21.5 billion. The company also notably doubled its AI XPU shipments to hyperscale customers. Despite a significant reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. TSM for nearly 95% of its wafers in fiscal 2024, Broadcom maintained a substantial 64% gross margin, showcasing its strong pricing power and market position. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan expressed strong confidence in December last year, stating that the company could generate tens of billions in annual AI chip revenue by 2027, driven by increasing demand from prominent AI developers like OpenAI and xAI. Analysts echo this optimism. JP Morgan’s Harlan Sur noted that Broadcom has secured multi-year AI ASIC deals with OpenAI and a fifth major client, estimating a $150 billion AI semiconductor opportunity through 2029. BofA Securities’ Vivek Arya believes ASICs could capture 10-15% of the AI accelerator market, supporting Broadcom’s growth even as Nvidia retains a significant market share.

Title: These Stocks Soared in the First Half of 2025. Can They Keep It Up?

The stock market shook off one of its worst sell-offs in recent memory to finish the first half of 2025 on a high note. That's lifted stocks associated with AI, crypto—and gold. How did we get here? It's been a ride. Stocks plummeted in early April after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs that threatened to scramble global supply chains, spike prices, and slow growth. Trump's subsequent pause of those tariffs, however, ignited a rally that was further fueled by benign economic data and easing trade tensions. By the end of June, stocks had rebounded to record highs. Wall Street's latest rally has looked a bit like last year's bull market. Artificial intelligence continued to connect many of the market's winners. But a few new themes have emerged amid the Trump administration's shake-up of the status quo. Here, we'll examine the stock market's leaders from the first six months of 2025—and examine how the forces underlying their gains could evolve in the next six. Crypto investors have been handsomely rewarded for the industry’s spending on November’s election. The industry last year spent more than $100 million in support of pro-crypto candidates. In January, the “most pro-crypto Congress” in history was sworn in and Washington wasted little time giving the industry what it wanted. Federal regulators have dropped pending litigation against cryptocurrency companies. Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve. In May, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would establish a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, was introduced in the House of Representatives. And the Senate in June passed the GENIUS Act, legislation that establishes rules governing stablecoins. That's helped grow the cryptocurrency market's value to more than $3.2 trillion. Washington’s embrace, however, has also boosted related stocks this year. Robinhood (HOOD) stock more than doubled in price in the first half, while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose 41%. Circle Internet Group’s (CRCL) shares more than doubled during the stablecoin issuer’s first day of trading in early June; the stock rose nearly 750% in the two weeks after its debut. The cryptocurrency legislation working its way through Congress is expected to have little trouble making its way to Trump’s desk for signature in the second half of this year. Trump and his family may continue feeding the industry’s animal spirits with new crypto ventures. Analysts came into the year expecting the group of stocks considered emblematic of the AI trade to change. That has panned out to an extent. Leadership was expected to shift from AI infrastructure stocks—companies like Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips fill the data centers that cloud computing giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) use to train and run AI models—to software and services providers developing and monetizing AI applications. Palantir (PLTR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year; its impressive sales and earnings growth have been driven primarily by its AI software. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is the Magnificent Seven’s best performer year-to-date thanks in part to its success introducing AI features that have improved performance metrics. Software stocks are expected to continue to outperform as they improve AI models and develop new applications. They could also benefit from their relative insulation from trade uncertainty, which dented the overall stock market’s returns in the first half. AI infrastructure, a theme that outperformed for most of 2024, continued to be a winner on Wall Street in the first half of this year. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta looked through economic uncertainty and stood by plans to cumulatively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property, buildings, and equipment this year. Much of that spending is earmarked for the technology required to develop and run advanced AI, like Nvidia chips, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) servers, and Amphenol (APH) fiber optic cables. Those hardware suppliers saw their shares rise 18%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, in the first half. The buildout of power-hungry data centers boosted the stocks of nuclear power providers, whose electricity is in demand from tech companies who say they are looking to shrink their carbon footprints. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) advanced 44% and 41%, respectively. But bringing new nuclear power online is a long process, and data centers are in the meantime relying on natural gas, boosting the stocks of gas-fired plant operators like NRG Energy (NRG), up 78% year-to-date, and gas turbine makers like GE Vernova (GEV), up 61%. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to be resilient. Tech giants “are planning for long-term data center capacity requirements and won’t alter their investment plans based on tariff regimes that change from week to week,” said Shaon Baqui, tech equities analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. The mood globally in the first half of 2025 was tense, to put it mildly. That was good for gold. In five months, the second Trump administration launched a global trade war targeting friends and foes alike; opened questions about America's commitment to longtime alliances like NATO; increased America’s involvement in Israel’s conflict with its neighbors; and ratcheted up tensions with China. Investors who sought stability turned to gold, a time-honored safe-haven asset. Gold prices climbed to record high after record high, peaking at more than $3,450 on June 13, the day Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Shares of gold miner Newmont (NEM) followed prices higher, rising 56% over the first half of the year. Fellow miners Barrick (B) and Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) advanced 34% and 52%, respectively. Central banks, wary of inflation and their reliance on U.S.-controlled reserve assets, have been major buyers of gold in recent years. Demand for gold is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as governments around the world seek to hedge against elevated geopolitical tensions and an uncertain global economic outlook. The World Gold Council’s most recent Central Bank Gold Reserves survey found that nearly all central banks expect global gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. A record 43% of respondents said they plan to add to their gold holdings over the same period.

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time ... More to look at what the second half of the year might hold. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The boost from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies was also notably in the rebound. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time to look at what the second half of the year might hold. Rather than the traditional outlook, this will be an examination of the risks versus rewards, considering what is currently priced in financial markets. The massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%, with stocks dragged lower in expectation of lower earnings. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The recent 12-day military conflict between Israel and Iran caused concerns about an economically unfriendly oil shock. Still, the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities has led to a ceasefire, which has cooled fears. Stocks & Recession Odds The betting odds of recession also tell much of the story about the US 10-year Treasury note yield. Yields fell as fears of an economic downturn rose and have since recovered from the lows, as economic risk appears to have waned. There is more to the story here, as signs suggest that bond markets worldwide are less willing to fund the unfavorable fiscal situations of most countries. Yields & Recession Odds Stocks soared last week on the ceasefire in the Israel-Iran war and the agreement around a framework for US-China trade. The S&P 500 surpassed its mid-February high by 0.5% after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 4% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. Apart from the good news on trade and Iran, the strength in US bank stocks was notable. Last week, the annual Federal Reserve (Fed) stress tests for large banks were better than expected. Additionally, the Fed made some changes to the methodology, which are expected to result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital buffers means better profitability. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since stocks bottomed, marking the peak of recession fears. The current situation is back to pricing in a benign, if not downright optimistic, economic backdrop. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Based on the current 24.3 times current earnings and 23.4 times multiple of 2025 estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies generate profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Although the ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average, which argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. Consensus estimates project a return on equity of 18.6% in 2025 and 19.4% in 2026, up from 17.6% in 2024. To provide perspective, the S&P 500’s ROE was 15.1% in 2019 before the pandemic. S&P 500: Price-To-Earnings & ROE The composition of the large-cap US stock market is crucial to this improved outlook for ROE since much of the boost has come from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Even a simple analysis of the S&P 500 shows that at least 43% of the market capitalization is related to these two areas. Weights In S&P 500 As noted earlier, the exceptional return on equity supports the rich stock valuations, and profit margins are elevated relative to historical levels. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that are converted into bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are almost twice the market. In addition, according to FactSet, technology sector earnings are expected to grow at 18% in 2025, while the S&P 500’s earnings are forecast to rise by about 9.1% year-over-year. S&P 500: Profitability According to Warren Buffett, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business. Thus, free cash flow provides a good measure of the money accruing to shareholders as owners. The free cash flow yield is calculated by dividing the free cash flow by the stock price. Consistent with the price-to-earnings ratio, the cash flow yield suggests that the stock market is not currently cheap, although it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes that free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as indicating that investors have more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and the superior fundamentals of the group as a whole. The profit margins and earnings growth rate for the technology sector have been exceptional, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. One additional wrinkle is the massive capital spending (capex) that Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure. This spending is also depressing the current free cash flow yield for the technology-related stocks on the margin. Massive capital expenditure (capex) spending is often viewed as a red flag for investors, who are typically concerned that the substantial investment will not yield a sufficient return for the companies. However, these four companies are currently being given the benefit of the doubt. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield The main event of the holiday-shortened trading week will be the monthly jobs report on Thursday. Economists expect June’s gain in nonfarm payrolls to slow to 113,000 from 139,000 in May. Notably, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.3% from 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Given the upward trend in weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits, the expected uptick in unemployment is a reasonable assumption. The upward trend indicates that the job market has been softening as it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to get a new one. With expectations for the US economy rebounding and the risk of recession decreasing, the resilience of the labor market should be closely monitored. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Markets currently expect at least two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is a slight chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is fully priced for September. Fed Rate Cuts Expected In the wake of the rebound from the tariff-induced bear market decline in stocks, investors should revisit their risk tolerance, as the robust stock rally over the last couple of years has likely increased their allocation to risk assets. Rebalancing stock and bond allocations toward the target risk level is wise for many investors, especially given the ongoing presence of tariff, geopolitical, and fiscal risks. The key to successful long-term stock investing is staying invested during the inevitable tough times, as rebounds from those bear markets are typically massive and unpredictable in timing, as illustrated by the first half of this year. Stocks are priced for a benign economic outcome and some support from the Federal Reserve in lowering interest rates. Improving corporate profitability, with 9% earnings growth in 2025 and 14% in 2026, is forecasted to normalize currently elevated valuations. This outcome is certainly possible, if not the most probable, but investors should be mindful that the hurdles at these valuation levels are higher. The artificial intelligence wave is a real phenomenon as adoption continues, so the optimistic scenario is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. This optimism should be tempered by the fact that the economy and earnings can always disappoint, especially if the trade war heats up again; therefore, investors should be prepared for possible turbulence.
