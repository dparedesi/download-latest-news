Title: Super Micro: Assessing the Potential Risk and Reward

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) got off to an incredible start this year as shares more than quadrupled from January to mid-March. This surge made Super Micro eligible for S&P 500 inclusion, with the technology hardware stock (with links to AI) being added to the index on March 18, 2024. In hindsight, that would have been a great time to take profits or Short the stock, as shares are down by more than 50% since then. One of the major developments has been the report by Hindenburg Research, which contained worrying allegations about the company’s financial reporting. In assessing those allegations along with Super Micro’s fundamentals I hold a neutral rating on the stock. The Hindenburg report is actually the main reason I am neutral instead of bullish on SMCI stock, and I believe it has caused hesitancy among many AI stock analysts and investors. The accusations are pretty straightforward. According to Hindenburg, Super Micro engaged in accounting manipulation which included “sibling self-dealing and evading sanctions”. Anyone who thinks this sounds far fetched may wish to remember that the SEC charged Super Micro with widespread accounting violations in August 2020. Hindenburg’s report also argued that most of the people involved with that accounting malpractice are back on Super Micro’s team. Hindenburg’s team interviewed several Super Micro salespeople and employees when compiling their report. It doesn’t help that Super Micro delayed its 10-K filing to assess internal controls shortly after Hindenburg went public with its concerns. While this might simply be a coincidence, the timing is worrisome. Looking back several years, Super Micro had failed to file financial statements in 2018 and was briefly delisted from the Nasdaq as a result. Near the beginning of this month, Super Micro publicly issued a denial of the accusations, with CEO Charles Liang hitting back, stating that Hindenburg’s report contained, “misleading presentations of information”. Super Micro hasn’t provided any additional statements since then. Super Micro’s status as part of the fast moving world of AI is one of the few reasons that I am neutral instead of bearish SMCI stock. The exciting prospects for the company’s business and the serious nature of the Hindenburg allegations basically offset each other. It’s hard to know what’s real and what’s false here, but most people concede that the AI industry as a whole offers compelling growth prospects. Nvidia (NVDA) has been posting triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters. Other tech giants have incorporated artificial intelligence into their core businesses and delivered impressive results for their shareholders. For instance, Alphabet (GOOGL) saw its cloud revenue rise by 28.8% year-over-year as many businesses rushed to create their own AI tools. The artificial intelligence industry is also projected to maintain a 19.3% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2034, according to Precedence Research. The AI industry should continue to grow, and that should lift Super Micro. The company should benefit from Nvidia’s growth, which is why the company posted exceptional revenue and net income growth during Nvidia’s ascent. That’s what we saw for several quarters. We just don’t know how accurate all the numbers were, if the allegations targeting the firm have merit. While it’s impossible to overlook Hindenburg’s allegations against Super Micro, it’s still worthwhile assessing the company’s previous quarterly results. Shares were dropping even before Hindenburg released its report. While in March 2024 I argued that SMCI stock faced risks, I felt that shares presented a tremendous buying opportunity in late-summer, until Hindenburg muddied that optimism. For its last reported quarter, Super Micro posted net sales of $5.31 billion, representing a 143% year-over-year jump. Meanwhile, net income rose by 82% year-over-year, reaching $353 million. At the time of the release, my primary concern was Super Micro’s declining net profit margin. Super Micro currently trades at a 20x trailing P/E ratio, seemingly enough to compensate for any further erosion in profit margins. SMCI stock has a ridiculously low 13.6x forward P/E ratio, but with the recent speedbumps (the Hindenburg report and DOJ investigation) investors seems reluctant to bid the valuation multiple any higher right now. We don’t yet have tangible proof that Super Micro has engaged in any wrongdoing, as alleged by Hindenburg. Their report, however, has certainly cast a black eye on the stock. I expect that Super Micro would have significantly outperformed its fiscal 2023 results even excluding any misdealings. The Super Micro controversy added a new chapter on September 26, as news crossed the wires that the U.S. Department of Justice is now probing the company. SMCI stock tumbled an additional 12% on this news, and shares were recently trading at less than one-third of their all time high in March. There’s a high risk/reward on the shares at this point, but the elevated risks have relegated me to the sidelines with a neutral rating. Super Micro shares bounced back by more than 4% on Friday, September 27, suggesting that many investors believe that the long-term potential for the business is worth the heightened uncertainty. Although the ratings for this stock could change quickly, Super Micro currently has 2 Buy ratings, 10 Hold ratings, and 1 Sell rating from the 13 analysts that cover the stock. The average price target for SMCI is $613.92, which implies potential upside of nearly 50%. Again though, it’s quite possible that several research brokerages have placed their SMCI ratings under review. SMCI stock does have a few low price targets including $454, $375 and $325 from CFRA, Wells Fargo (WFC), and Susquehanna respectively. All of these price targets were established before the DOJ probe was announced, so even they could drop lower. There’s an old adage that suggests, “You either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain”. That quote seems apropos for this company. Super Micro earned many investors hefty profits during its rise above a stock price of $1,000 per share. Those who entered the story late, including after SMCI stock was added to the S&P 500, have not fared well. Many investors are sitting on significant losses right now. Depending on what those investors do, it’s hard to tell how much more downside Super Micro shares may have until more clarity on the ordeals is available. If the company’s recent financials are accurate, SMCI shares look quite attractive here. Shares can surge quickly if the Hindenburg report loses relevance, although that outcome difficult to predict. I’m a big fan of Super Micro’s industry and business potential related to AI, which prevents me from being downright bearish. I have a neutral stance here. Meanwhile, I don’t expect shares of SMCI to rebound above $460 (the approximate price prior to news of the DOJ probe) without any resolution to the two main threats to shareholder value.

Title: 20 Geopolitical Events with Highest Impact on S&P 500

In this article, we will look at the 20 geopolitical events with highest impact on S&P 500. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 Geopolitical Events with Highest Impact on S&P 500. The geopolitical events impact the financial markets across the world depending on the nature of the event. The assassination attempt on former US President Donald J. Trump is the latest geopolitical event investors have had to grapple with in recent years, alongside two major wars including Russia-Ukraine and ongoing Israel’s aggression on Gaza. Wars have far-reaching effects such as an impact on financial markets, in addition to enormous human toll. Geopolitics events that affect the economy drastically caution investors to look for safe haven investments or be out of the market until the situation comes to normal. According to JP Morgan Private Bank’s recent client survey, 34% of the investors were potentially worried about geopolitical risks, while 29% of investors were bothered by potential recession fears in 2024. Whereas, almost 90% of the geopolitical events have not changed the direction of the world economy, as per Citigroup Inc.’s Global Wealth Report 2024. Geopolitical events mostly have short-term impacts on global asset prices. However, World War II and the 1973 OPEC Oil Embargo had the gravest impact on the financial markets. The 1973 oil shock did have a lasting impact on equity returns. During the first 90 days, the S&P 500 plunged by nearly 13.04%, the highest among geopolitical events since 1940. The oil supply was limited for an extended period, leading to a macro state of ‘stagflation.’ In simple terms, high oil prices essentially stopped the economy from operating efficiently in the 1970s. On the other side, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shocked global energy markets in 2022. However, additional oil supply limited the economic and market impact compared to its 1970s counterpart. Today, the US has a more secure oil supply compared to its heavy reliance on the Middle East. In recent times, the rising conflicts in the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war have had major consequences. The US has been aiding Ukraine and Israel with military assistance. According to the US State Department, the US government has provided more than $55.7 billion in military assistance to Ukraine to fight against Russian invasion since the war began in February 2022. Whereas, the US government has supported Israel through legislation providing at least $12.5 billion in military aid, as of April 2024. It has been a see-saw year for the global economies. The intensified conflict in the Middle East may impact oil prices with a potential disruption in regional supply. As of September 23, oil prices have been high as the conflicts soar, and due to last week's outsized US interest rate cut expectations. As reported by Reuters, Yeap Jun Rong, the market strategist at IG International, said: “Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have edged up a notch between Israel and Hezbollah, which could leave oil prices well-supported on the risks of a wider regional conflict." Brent crude futures for November were up $0.60, or 0.8% at $75.09 per barrel, while the US crude futures for November were up $0.64, or 0.9%, at $71.64, as of September 23. In addition, both oil benchmarks soared over 4% last week due to the US rate cut, weaker demand sentiment in top oil importer China is capping the upswing, reported Reuters.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the leading American multinationals in the oil and gas sector. The company engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas both domestically and internationally. Exxon Mobil Corporation recently signed a MOU with an EV maker SK On. The oil and gas company has agreed to provide 100,000 metric tons of MobilTMLithium from its first planned project in Arkansas. This deal will help ExxonMobil’s goal of supplying lithium for almost 1 million EV batteries annually by 2030 and support the build-out of a US EV supply chain. For the second quarter of 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) surpassed earnings estimates, reporting an EPS of $2.14, up by 6.51% compared to anticipated earnings of $2.02 per share. Exxon Mobil posted $9.2 billion in earnings, making its second-best Q2 performance in the past decade. The company achieved this feat following record production in Guyana and the Permian Basin, where the output reached 1.2 million barrels per day. The company’s revenue came in at $93.06 billion, exceeding estimated revenue of $89.68 billion. Alongside strong operational results, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) gave back $9.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.3 billion in dividends. XOM has more than 40 years of consistent dividend growth and averaged a 2.20% yield over the past five years. In addition, Exxon Mobil plans to invest between $20 billion and $25 billion annually in capital expenditures through 2027. With strong hedge fund sentiment, XOM is one of the 10 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Right Now. Hedge fund interest in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) soared from 81 in Q1 2024 to 92 in Q2 2024. Madison Dividend Income Fund pointed out regarding XOM in the Q1 2024 investor letter: “Our thesis on XOM is that it will grow production volumes of oil and gas moderately over the next few years, while limiting excessive capital investment that plagued the industry from 2014-2020. Production growth will come from its 2023 acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which is the largest producer in the Permian basin. XOM plans to double its Permian output by 2027, to 2 million barrels per day. Capital spending will be limited to $20-25 billion per yearthrough 2027, which should allow for significant amounts of cash to be returned to shareholders including a $35 billion share repurchase program and continued dividend increases. Higher oil prices would provide a tailwind to our thesis but are not necessary. We think XOM can grow earnings and cash flow if oil prices remain above $60 per barrel…” (Click here to read the full text) While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Most Active Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other active stocks. The economic landscape is currently marked by mixed signals. The Fed has indicated the potential for additional rate cuts due to weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, despite signs of recovery. While the overall economy remains strong, currency dynamics have shifted, with the US dollar weakening and the euro strengthening. Interest rate yields have fluctuated, suggesting potential changes in investor sentiment. Amidst this complex environment, the Dow continues to hover near record highs, reflecting cautious optimism among market participants. As stakeholders navigate these developments, they will need to carefully consider how they may influence investment strategies and market behavior in the coming months. CNBC's Rick Santelli recently covered this situation, which we talked about in our article on the 10 Best Performing Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it: “Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has indicated that many more rate cuts may be necessary over the next year due to signs of weakness in the manufacturing sector. CNBC’s Rick Santelli, who was reporting on September 23, noted that while manufacturing has faced challenges, there are indications it might be recovering slightly, as evidenced by a recent production increase of 0.8%. He referenced comments.... that the economy is experiencing strong growth and robust consumer spending, which he believed contradicted the concerns raised by Goolsbee. Santelli pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently at all-time highs, suggesting that market sentiment remains positive despite underlying economic weaknesses. Further discussing the economic landscape, he remarked on the currency markets, noting that the US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since March 2022. In contrast, the euro has reached its strongest level since April 2022. This shift in currency dynamics reflects broader economic trends...” However, a lot of analysts do not have an opinion as nuanced as that of Santelli. For instance, Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist joined CNBC's 'Power Lunch' on September 23 to discuss why smaller businesses and consumers need the benefits from more rate cuts. In a conversation regarding the challenges facing US car manufacturers, it was noted that the biggest threat they encounter is the influx of Chinese automobiles into the US market. This concern contrasted with the insights from the President of the Bank of Chicago, who stated that ongoing rate cuts will continue to benefit smaller businesses and consumers who are currently adjusting to higher interest rates. Kantrowitz emphasized the significant impact that lower interest rates can have on the consumer economy, particularly given the substantial amount of debt tied to credit lines and credit cards. As adjustable-rate mortgages decrease, this easing of financial conditions is expected to be beneficial. Kantrowitz pointed out that before last week, financial conditions had been easing primarily for larger corporations, as evidenced by the S&P 500, which did not require a rate cut. However, small businesses and consumers, who are more closely tied to the prime rate set by banks, had not experienced similar relief until recently. The last report indicated that small businesses were paying an interest rate of 9.5% for 3-month borrowing. This recent easing represents a crucial first step for Main Street, although the strategist believes further cuts are necessary. He noted a broadening market trend following the July 11 CPI report, highlighting that commercial real estate has emerged as one of the best-performing sectors this quarter, alongside utilities and regional banks. However, it was emphasized that while rate cuts can benefit certain areas indirectly, such as those affected by lower tenure rates, they do not necessarily provide direct support. Looking ahead at interest rates, there was speculation about how low they might go in the next year. Kantrowitz suggested that policy rates could indeed fall into the 3% range but cautioned that markets might be overly aggressive in their expectations. The anticipated rise in unemployment will play a critical role in shaping equity and fixed-income markets; however, if unemployment increases at a slow and steady pace, as it has been, it may not pose significant challenges to market stability. Kantrowitz's opinion reflects a cautious optimism regarding economic conditions as stakeholders face uncertain conditions while keeping an eye on interest rates and their broader implications for various sectors within the economy. Methodology We sifted through Yahoo Finance's list of the most active stocks that are experiencing high trading volumes. We looked at the top 15 stocks to find the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We then narrowed down our list to the 10 stocks with high trading volumes and that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their trading volumes, as of September 23. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Volume: 120.458 million Average Volume (3-Month): 327.422 million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and other computing technologies. Its GPUs are widely used in gaming, professional visualization, and AI applications, and the company has been a pioneer in the field of GPU computing, with a significant role in the development of AI and deep learning. In FQ2 2025, the company's revenue was 122.40% from a year-ago period. Data center revenue was up 54% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers contributed ~45% of data center revenue. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and increasing demand for AI-powered solutions in diagnostics have contributed to this strong financial performance. At its GPU Technology Conference earlier this year, the CEO estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion, with a potential total of $1-2 trillion over the next decade. The company won't dominate the entire market, but analysts estimate its market share between 2025 and 2029 will be over $950 billion. Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has brought Colossal, an AI training system, online. Powered by 100,000 H100 GPUs from NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colossal is the most powerful AI training system in the world. Musk plans to double the size of Colossal by shifting to H200 GPUs in the coming months. Blackwell chips, which are even faster and more efficient, could further enhance Colossal's capabilities. The company faces pressure to launch new products to maintain investor confidence. Delays in Blackwell chip production and concerns about high GPU prices impact demand. The company's future success depends on effective AI monetization. By the end of fiscal year 2025, it aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the most active stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: These 5 Stocks Grew More than Bitcoin Over the Last Year

Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:44:00Z

While Bitcoin's 130% surge grabbed headlines this past year, a select group of stocks outpaced the cryptocurrency behemoth. AppLovin (APP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Powell Industries (POWL), and TG Therapeutics (TGTX) all rode waves of market demand to deliver eye-popping returns. These five companies found remarkable success in their sectors, from AI breakthroughs to fronting an industrial boom. Moreover, their stellar performance wasn't just a flash in the pan. Standing behind their stock price increases are robust fundamentals and impressive metrics like revenue growth and return on equity (ROE), which suggest these stocks could keep outshining Bitcoin, one of the most volatile assets. Below, we dig into how they did it. Over the past year, BTC has had one of its best years, more than doubling in price. This was driven by the start of trading for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), market sentiment, and other major financial catalysts. In late October 2023, BTC pierced the $30,000 level in a rally spurred by anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the spot BTC ETFs. The approval of ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity significantly increased the institutional demand for BTC, increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. By January 2024, BTC's price surged to $49,000. There was also anticipation for the upcoming BTC halving event. However, the cryptocurrency didn't climb upwards all year. In late January 2024, BTC corrected, dipping 20% to a low of $38,500. This was only a pullback, and by mid-February 2024, the cryptocurrency had rallied past $50,000. The BTC spring halving was another major catalyst for the cryptocurrency, as halving events reduce BTC's supply by cutting mining rewards in half, usually leading to a spike in its price. By mid-March 2024, BTC reached an all-time high of $73,835, fueled by solid demand, particularly from ETFs. Despite this peak, BTC began consolidating, trading between $49,000 and $73,895 for the following months. In the preceding 12 months, the price of Bitcoin rose 150%. The gauges for the stocks selected below are as follows: Below, we discuss the criteria further, but let's get to our analysis first: Among the top performers, APP led the pack with an impressive one-year return of 227.6%, supported by robust revenue growth of 37.3%. NVDA was close on its heels, delivering a 180.7% price return, kickstarted by extraordinary revenue growth of 194.7%. This was primarily thanks to surging demand in AI and data center sectors. TGTX stood out with its remarkable revenue growth of 1,341.6%, though its one-year price return of 160.1% was comparatively modest. POWL Industries and MMYT had consistent performance, with one-year returns of 179.7% and 182.1%, respectively. POWL's growth was particularly noteworthy at 44.8%. Regarding profitability and valuation metrics, NVDA emerged as a leader with an impressive return on equity (ROE) of 123.77% and a strong price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, indicative of its market dominance. TGTX was also quite strong, with a high ROE of 87.8%, though its P/B ratio at 21.0 was more modest. AppLovin's ROE of 70.7% was solid, but its particularly high P/B of 52.2 suggests investors are placing a significant premium on its expected growth. POWL appears lower in risk as a stock, given its P/B of 5.9 and steady ROE of 34.2%. MakeMyTrip rounded out the group with an ROE of 22.2% and a relatively high P/S of 14.4, reflecting a balanced growth trajectory and investors' optimism about its future in the expanding Indian travel market. AppLovin Corporation specializes in mobile app development and marketing products. The company provides a platform where developers can review metrics on their growth, work to increase user engagement, and review their mobile app revenues. AppLovin has demonstrated strong growth, with its stock price increasing by 228% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: AppLovin's high P/B ratio suggests that investors are placing a premium on the company's assets, likely because of its strong growth prospects and market position in the mobile app industry. That said, the company is in the highly competitive mobile technology sector. Its suite of tools and strong AI capabilities have positioned it as a leader in helping developers monetize their apps, particularly game developers. Holders of APP shares should be aware of potential risks: Despite these potential drawbacks, AppLovin's recent performance and strategic position have made it a standout in app development, allowing it to outpace even the impressive gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. MakeMyTrip is a major online travel company primarily serving the Indian market. Founded in 2000 and based in Gurgaon, India, the company offers the typically comprehensive range of travel-related services travelers expect from today's major platforms. MakeMyTrip has shown significant growth, with its stock price increasing by 182% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: MakeMyTrip is a dominant player in India's online travel space, benefiting from the country's large and growing middle class, increasing internet availability, and rising disposable incomes. The company's strong brand recognition and wide service offerings have helped it maintain a leading position in a competitive market. The company's high P/S and P/B ratios suggest that investors are optimistic about its future growth in the rapidly expanding Indian travel market. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, MakeMyTrip's strong market position and the robust growth of India's travel sector have contributed to its impressive stock performance, NVDA is one of the dominant companies producing advanced computer graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. Founded in 1993 and based in Santa Clara, California, the company plays a significant role in AI, autonomous technology, and high-performance computing, helping to shift the evolution of visual computing and AI. NVIDIA has achieved record-breaking quarters recently, which has been driven by several key factors: NVIDIA is dominant in the GPU market, particularly in AI and high-performance computing. The company's technology is driving advances in many industries, including autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and scientific research. However, investors should be aware of potential risks: Despite these risks, NVIDIA's strong market position and growing demand for AI and high-performance computing products have contributed to its exceptional stock performance, outpacing even the significant gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. Powell Industries, Inc., based in Houston, Texas, develops, designs, and manufactures custom-engineered systems and products for the energy and industrial sectors. The company is known for providing engineered products for electrical power infrastructure. Powell Industries has seen significant growth driven by several factors: The company's focus on custom products for critical infrastructure has helped it maintain a competitive edge. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, Powell Industries' strong performance in recent quarters and its strategic position in essential infrastructure markets have contributed to its impressive stock performance. TG Therapeutics, Inc., founded in 1993 and based in North Carolina, is a biopharmaceutical company that acquires, develops, and brings to market therapies for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. TG Therapeutics has had excellent growth, driven by several key factors: The company's focus on novel therapies for B-cell-mediated diseases positions it well in areas where critical medical needs are unmet. However, investors should be aware of the following risks: Despite these risks, TG Therapeutics' recent commercial success and strong pipeline have contributed to its impressive stock performance. In identifying the stocks that outperformed bitcoin in the past year, we used measures that would highlight companies with strong growth potential, financial health, and market performance. By focusing on the key indicators below, we pinpointed stocks that showed both impressive past performance and had the strength in fundamentals to continue their upward trajectory: Market Capitalization Greater Than $300 million (Small Cap and Higher) Companies with the market capitalization described above are established but still have significant potential for growth. Small-cap and mid-cap stocks often outperform larger companies because of their potential for rapid revenue growth while still being large enough to withstand some economic changes. This ensures that the stock is less prone to extreme volatility when compared with microcaps, which can be highly speculative. In addition, larger companies provide more liquidity, making buying and selling shares easier. TTM Revenue Growth More Than 25% Consistent high revenue growth is a crucial indicator of a company's ability to expand its market share, innovate, and meet consumer demand. Revenue growth of more than 25% yoy indicates that the company is rapidly increasing its earnings. Strong revenue growth often leads to growth in earnings and stock price increases. TTM ROE Greater Than 15% ROE measures a company's profitability relative to its equity. An ROE of over 15% is an excellent figure, showing that management effectively turns shareholder equity into profits. High ROE companies are typically well-managed, competitive, and able to reinvest earnings effectively. P/B of 5 and Above A high P/B typically signals that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets because they believe it will continue to generate superior returns. While a lower P/B is considered more value-driven, a higher P/B reflects increased expectations for growth and market confidence in the company's future performance. In high-growth stocks, a P/B of 5 or more suggests the company is well regarded for its potential. 1-Year Performance of More Than 150% A one-year price appreciation of over 150% demonstrates strong momentum, indicating that the stock has significantly outperformed the broader market. High performance over a year is often driven by strong earnings, revenue growth, and positive investor sentiment, all of which are necessary when selecting stocks that could outpace BTC's gains. Investors should focus on strong and consistent revenue growth and profitability metrics such as return on assets and ROE to identify stocks that may outperform cryptocurrencies like BTC. You should also review valuation ratios that show market confidence in future growth, such as high P/E or P/B ratios. Targeting industries with disruptive potential, such as AI or green energy, and selecting stocks with strong momentum and positive analyst reports are also worthwhile when selecting high-growth investments. Indeed, investing in stocks that could outperform BTC carries several risks, such as above-average market volatility. Valuation risks can also arise when stocks with high P/Es or P/Bs become overvalued. Industry-specific risks, such as regulatory challenges in sectors like technology and biotech, may hinder growth. In addition, stocks are sensitive to economic shifts like changes in interest rates and inflation. Company-specific or idiosyncratic issues, such as poor management or legal challenges, increase risk, requiring investors to look carefully before investing and diversifying their portfolios once they do. To diversify an investment portfolio with stocks and cryptocurrencies, investors should pick their holdings based on risk tolerance. Most investors will want to hold much of their portfolios in stable blue-chip stocks and other safer assets, with only a small portion for volatile cryptocurrencies. Over the past year, APP, MMYT, NVDA, POWL, and TGTX have had exceptional growth, outpacing even the stellar 150% rally in bitcoin's prices. Key drivers for these companies include strong revenue growth, high ROE, and market momentum. NVDA, in particular, capitalized on AI demand, while TGTX succeeded with its Briumvi therapy. APP and MMYT leveraged strategic new products, and POWL benefited from industrial sector growth, positioning these stocks as strong performers with robust fundamentals across very different sectors of the economy.

Title: Why Nvidia stock could soar over 500% by the end of the decade, former consulting exec says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-stock-prediction-nvda-price-forecast-blackwell-ai-chips-web3-2024-9
Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:21:47Z

Nvidia is headed for a meteoric run-up by the end of the decade, according to one former consulting exec. Phil Panaro — a former senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group who also served as CEO of a BCG subsidiary — says shares of the AI chipmaker will reach $800 by 2030. That implies another 545% upside for the stock, which traded around $122 a share mid-day Friday. The Jensen Huang-led firm will benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, as well as migration from Web2 to Web3, Panaro predicted, referring to the idea that the internet's next era will be denominated by blockchain technology. Those developments could result in big spending from Nvidia's customers, he said, pointing to estimates from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley that Web3 could fuel trillions of added value in the market. "Nvidia powers all of the accelerated computing, to make that happen, so they're going to have a major share of that," Panaro said in an interview with Schwab Network on Thursday. He later estimated that the firm's revenue could scale by a factor of 10, from $60 billion in the last fiscal year to $600 billion by 2030. Investors may not have to wait long to see some of those gains. Panaro foresees a "huge explosion" in the stock after Nvidia releases Blackwell, its next-gen AI chip, though he didn't specify his short-term price target. "Not to sound overconfident — it's actually inevitable provided that they can continue to make these chips," he later added of the firm's upside potential. "The AI penetration in the economy right now is literally less than 1%. So you still have all the corporates, the cities, the municipalities, the governments, the military, that are going to be spending money to make sure they leverage AI effectively. So tons of money still to be spent." Some strategists have been skeptical over Nvidia's rally, with the stock up a monster 2,733% over the last five years. Analysts have attributed some of that growth to "hyperscalers," a small group of Big Tech firms buying Nvidia's chips in large quantities. But despite concerns those customers could eventually pull away, the small group of buyers is actually a good sign Nvidia's business will scale, Panaro said. "That's actually the best case for why it's actually going to go up. Because if you look at all the other customers they're not getting to, there's 490 other Fortune 500 firms that haven't really adopted AI to the fullest because they don't understand it. You have all these cities and governments that are going to be redoing all their infrastructure from Web2 to Web3, and you then have the AI arms race, with countries and their militaries, which Nvidia hasn't penetrated for the most part," Panaro said. He continued: "The stock can go to the moon, essentially, provided that they deliver." Panaro's prediction leans on the extreme end of forecasters, but Wall Street is generally feeling bullish about the chipmaker's stock, which has climbed 152% since the start of the year. Analysts have issued an average price target of $152 a share for the stock, according to Nasdaq data, implying around 25% upside from current levels. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

Title: Wall Street SWOT: NVIDIA stock rides AI wave amid tech sector challenges
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/wall-street-swot-nvidia-stock-rides-ai-wave-amid-tech-sector-challenges-93CH-3636297
Time Published: 2024-09-27T14:02:27Z
Full Content:
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, leveraging its strong position in graphics processing units (GPUs) to capitalize on the growing demand for AI infrastructure. As the company prepares to report its July quarter earnings, analysts remain bullish on NVIDIA's prospects, despite concerns about product delays and increasing competition in the AI chip space. NVIDIA's data center segment has been the primary driver of the company's recent growth, with revenues expanding significantly year-over-year. The strong demand for NVIDIA's Hopper GPU computing platform, coupled with growth in InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue, has propelled the company's financial performance. Analysts expect this trend to continue, with some projecting NVIDIA's earnings per share (EPS) to exceed $10 by 2030. The company's full-stack ecosystem positions it to capture 70-80% of the value in the parallel processing era, according to some analysts. This dominance is supported by NVIDIA's CUDA software platform and deepening system software capabilities, which are seen as key differentiators in sustaining its growth trajectory. NVIDIA's product roadmap includes the ramp-up of its next-generation GPU architecture, Blackwell, which is expected to contribute significantly to revenue in the coming quarters. Despite reports of a slight delay in Blackwell's production, analysts remain confident in NVIDIA's ability to meet demand through increased shipments of its current Hopper architecture. The company is also focusing on expanding its presence in enterprise and edge computing markets. NVIDIA's AI Foundry and NIMs (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) offerings aim to simplify AI rollouts for enterprises, potentially opening up new revenue streams as businesses increasingly adopt AI technologies. While NVIDIA maintains a dominant position in the AI chip market, competition is intensifying. Traditional semiconductor companies like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are ramping up their efforts in the AI space, while major tech giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are developing custom silicon solutions for their AI needs. Despite these competitive pressures, analysts believe NVIDIA's technological lead and ecosystem advantages will allow it to maintain its market leadership in the near term. The company's ability to introduce new SKUs and adapt to changing market demands, such as developing the H20 product to meet export control requirements for the Chinese market, demonstrates its agility in responding to challenges. NVIDIA's financial projections paint a picture of robust growth. Analysts estimate the company's revenue to grow from $60.92 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $203.42 billion by fiscal year 2027. Similarly, EPS is expected to increase from $1.15 to $4.85 over the same period. The company's strong balance sheet, with improving financial ratios such as net debt/EBITDA moving into negative territory, provides NVIDIA with flexibility to invest in research and development and pursue strategic initiatives. Recent reports of delays in NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture have raised concerns about potential impacts on the company's competitive edge. While analysts generally view these delays as short-term issues, they could provide an opening for competitors to gain ground in the rapidly evolving AI chip market. If NVIDIA fails to execute its product roadmap effectively, it may face challenges in maintaining its dominant market share and meeting the growing demand for AI computing power. NVIDIA's global operations, particularly its reliance on manufacturing partners in Asia, expose it to geopolitical risks and potential export controls. The company has already faced challenges in selling certain high-performance chips to China due to U.S. government restrictions. While NVIDIA has developed products like the H20 to comply with these regulations, further tightening of export controls could significantly impact its ability to serve key markets. This geopolitical uncertainty adds a layer of risk to NVIDIA's growth prospects and could affect investor confidence in the long term. NVIDIA's CUDA software platform and extensive ecosystem of developers and applications create a significant moat around its business. This ecosystem advantage makes it challenging for competitors to replicate NVIDIA's full-stack offerings, potentially locking in customers and developers for the long term. As AI applications become more prevalent across industries, NVIDIA's established ecosystem could drive sustained growth and market leadership, even in the face of increasing competition. While NVIDIA is best known for its GPUs in gaming and data centers, the company is actively expanding into new markets such as automotive, healthcare, and robotics. These diversification efforts could provide additional growth vectors and reduce NVIDIA's reliance on any single market segment. If successful, this strategy could help NVIDIA maintain its growth trajectory even if its core markets face temporary headwinds or increased competition. The company's efforts in areas like autonomous driving and AI-powered medical imaging could open up substantial new revenue streams in the coming years. NVIDIA Corporation continues to navigate the complex landscape of the AI and semiconductor industries, balancing strong growth prospects with emerging challenges. As the company moves forward, its ability to maintain technological leadership, expand into new markets, and manage geopolitical risks will be crucial in determining its long-term success. Investors and analysts will be closely watching NVIDIA's upcoming earnings report and guidance for further insights into its trajectory in the rapidly evolving AI market.

Title: Vistra is the Top S&P 500 Gainer This Year—Key Stock Price Levels to Monitor

Shares in electric utility Vistra (VST), the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 this year, hit another record high in early trading Thursday before losing ground to close lower. Wall Street analysts say that the utility’s nuclear assets place it in a position to capitalize on the significant energy requirements needed to power artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, such as data centers. In reports this week, Jefferies bumped its 12-month target on the stock to $137 from $99, while Morgan Stanley upwardly revised its target on the shares to $132 from $110, The AI utilities poster-child's stock price has surged three-fold since the start of the year, recently toppling AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA) for the coveted position of the S&P 500’s top performing stock. Vistra hit a new high of $122.01 early Thursday, before retreating to finish 4.1% lower at $114.16. The stock had risen nearly 6% on Wednesday. Below, we take a closer look at Vistra's chart and use technical analysis to point out important price levels to watch out for. After completing a 12-month trending move higher in May, Vistra shares traded within a symmetrical triangle for several months before staging a breakout above the pattern earlier this month. In recent weeks, the stock has continued to make an impulsive move higher on above-average volume, indicating strong buying conviction. The relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 80 threshold, but also warns of extremely overbought conditions that could give rise to near-term profit taking. Looking ahead, investors should monitor several key levels on Vistra’s chart likely to attract attention. During retracements, the shares could initially retest the $107 level, where they may find support around the prominent late-May peak, which also marks the start of the symmetrical triangle. Further selling could see the shares fall to the $95 region, a location on the chart where investors may seek entry points near a trendline connecting comparable trading levels from May to July with the Sept. 19 pre-gap high. A deeper retracement in the shares could bring the $76 level into play. This area, sitting just below the symmetrical triangle’s lower trendline, would likely encounter buying interest near the April swing high and this month’s swing low. To project a price target for the stock’s current trending move, investors can use the measuring principle. To do this, we calculate the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near the start of the pattern and add that amount to the breakout point. For example, we add $50 to $85, which forecasts an upside target of $135. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Micron Stock Pops as Sales and Guidance Impress

Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher as the latest estimates from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth slightly outpaced expectations in the second quarter of 2024. The S&P 500 added 0.4% on Thursday, printing a new all-time closing high. The Dow gained 0.6%, ending just below the level of Tuesday's record close. The Nasdaq was also up 0.6%, boosted by strength in the tech sector and solid gains from semiconductor stocks. Micron Technology (MU) shares secured Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, skyrocketing 14.7% after the memory chip maker beat revenue estimates and provided higher-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter. The Nvidia (NVDA) partner nearly doubled its revenue from the year-ago period, with strong artificial intelligence (AI) demand helping underpin the strong sales growth. The firm's CEO said Micron's competitive positioning has reached its highest point in company history. Circuit board manufacturer Jabil (JBL) also reported strong quarterly results, topping sales and profit estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter. Like Micron, Jabil benefitted from strong AI demand during the quarter. The electronics manufacturer and Apple (AAPL) supplier also approved a $1 billion share repurchase plan and announced several cost-cutting initiatives. Jabil shares jumped 11.7% on Thursday. Shares of beauty products company Estée Lauder (EL) popped 10.0% higher following the announcement of an economic stimulus in China. The makeup maker generates around a third of its revenue from the Asia/Pacific region. However, in its most recent earnings report, Estée Lauder pointed to softness in the prestige beauty market in China as a key factor behind its 2% year-over-year decline in organic net sales. Any improvement in consumer sentiment that results from the stimulus could flow through to increased consumer spending and help drive a sales recovery for Estée Lauder in the key market. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged 12.2%, falling further than any other S&P 500 stock on Thursday. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched an investigation into the server and data storage provider's accounting practices. News of the DOJ probe follows a report published last month by activist short-selling firm Hindenburg Research alleging that Supermicro had engaged in accounting manipulation. Crude oil futures prices fell more than 3% amid reports that Saudi Arabia and other major producers are prepared to increase oil output in December, pressuring oil and gas stocks. Diamondback Energy (FANG) stock slid 6.5%, with news that insiders sold more than $2.3 billion worth of in the exploration and production company. Softness in natural gas prices also dragged on companies in that part of the energy sector. Shares of natural gas players Targa Resources (TRGP) and Oneok (OKE) were down around 5.9%.

Title: Volatile Month for Nvidia Stock Continues

The volatile month for shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued Thursday, as the stock surged in early trading only to slip into negative territory in the afternoon. The chip-maker’s shares, the year’s second-best performers in the S&P 500, rose more than 3% in the opening minutes of Thursday's session to trade near $127. That put them substantially above the roughly $119 at which they finished August, marking a recovery from September intraday lows near $101. In recent trading, however, the stock was down about 0.2% near $123, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also came off their earlier highs. The early move Thursday came as earnings from Micron (MU), a Nvidia partner, came in better than expected, sending chip stocks higher across the board. Micron pointed to "robust AI demand" as it issued a rosy revenue outlook. Bank of America analysts in a Thursday note said Micron’s results pointed to “a positive read-across” for Nvidia and other semi stocks. Wall Street analysts are still broadly bullish on Nvidia’s shares. Nearly all of the analysts currently tracking the stock have “buy” ratings on it, according to Visible Alpha data, while their mean price target of $152.52 represents a more than 20% premium to Wednesday’s closing price. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this week reported the conclusion of a planned sale of some $700 million in company stock.

Wall Street is looking at a higher open Thursday, led by surging tech stocks after memory chipmaker Micron delivered a better-than-expected quarter and upside guide. Micron shares jumped 18%. China stocks rallied again — this time on signs the Chinese government is prepared to add fiscal stimulus to this week's central bank monetary stimulus. The commentary out of China supported global markets. 2. Micron said high bandwidth memory sold out for calendar year 2024 and 2025. Personal computers set to have a better second half of 2025 as artificial intelligence PCs gain momentum. Micron's smartphone unit growth expected to continue in 2025. Jim Cramer said on X: "If you bought Micron off of our suggestion from our [Mad Money] Gameplan last Friday I would not sell it. That was some forecast for every business in 2025. It also affirms AMD and NVDA outlooks." Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are Club stocks. 3. Starbucks was upgraded to an outperform buy rating at Bernstein. Even after the stock's 27% move since Brian Niccol was named CEO, the analysts think the valuation of the Club stock "does not fully appreciate the earnings power that Starbucks could unlock." Starbucks also was getting a bump on the fiscal stimulus commitment from the Chinese government. 4. GE Healthcare was downgraded to sell at UBS on concerns about rising competition from Chinese competitors. The analysts' pessimism seems overblown. The company has a strong relationship in China and has been manufacturing there for 30 years. Health-care stimulus packages in China have been slow to roll out, and that's weighed on the Club-owned maker of MRI machines. Here's our screen on China exposure for all of our 32 portfolio stocks. 5. Bank of America raised its Meta Platforms to $630 per share from $563, representing 10% upside to Wednesday's close. JPMorgan took its PT on Meta to $640. The fresh bullish commentary followed the wearable showcase at the company's Connect 2024 product and developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brought out prototype AR glasses that received rave reviews, including a stamp of approval from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. 6. Southwest Airlines upped its third quarter forecast and announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program and other changes at its investor day on Thursday. The carrier is making the moves as it battles activist investor group Elliott Management. 7. Truist started First Solar and power play GE Vernova with buy ratings. For the Club, our solar and renewable play is Nextracker, whose technology makes sure solar panels are always facing the sun. We also own Eaton as a way to benefit from the growing complexity of energy infrastructure in the age of AI. 8. Jefferies Financial dropped on a quarterly profit and revenue miss. The results provided an early look into investment banking and capital markets activity before the big banks, including Club names Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, report in a couple of weeks. Jefferies said IB was strong and capital markets were only down a bit compared to tough comps. 9. JPMorgan raised its DraftKings price target to $54 per share from $48 and kept its overweight buy rating. The analysts said positive comments at online betting and iGaming platform Flutter Entertainment's Capital Markets Day is good news for DraftKings. Flutter is FanDuel's parent company. 10. Hershey was downgraded to an underperform sell by Jefferies research analysts on chocolate snacking concerns. The analysts said that "everyday chocolate is being bought less frequently, especially by low-income consumers," because prices are so high. — Sign up for Jim Cramer's Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Title: Nvidia is back in the $3 trillion club — and Jensen Huang is $2 billion richer

Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang is $2.3 billion richer thanks to a recent bump in Nvidia stock. Shares of the chip giant were up more than 2% in pre-market trading, after closing up about 2% at $123.51 apiece Wednesday. The uptick in the company’s stock brought its market capitalization back above $3 trillion, recovering ground from recent losses and bringing Nvidia back into the coveted club. Huang’s net worth now stands at $108 billion, making him the 13th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes. The CEO has a roughly 3% stake in Nvidia, which makes up the majority of his net worth. This current uptick in Nvidia stock may be driven by Bain’s annual technology report, released Wednesday, that predicted that the market for AI products could reach as much as almost $1 trillion by 2027. The consulting firm predicted that companies will need to make “unprecedented levels of investment in technology infrastructure” to remain on top — a positive signal to investors that mass funding of data centers and other critical AI infrastructure will remain strong. “If large data centers currently cost between $1 billion and $4 billion, costs for data centers five years from now could be between $10 billion and $25 billion,” the report said. Nvidia is one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers, and has become a bellwether for excitement and demand for artificial intelligence. The company has seen its bottom line balloon on demand for chips that can power the AI boom, like its Blackwell and H200 chips. It was also the first chipmaker to reach a $2 trillion market cap in February, snagging the title of third-most valuable company in the world in March. It was briefly the most valuable company in the world this summer. But shares have been largely trending downward for the past month. Despite an earnings beat that saw record second-quarter revenue of $30 billion for fiscal year 2025 — up 122% from a year ago — Nvidia stock is still down 2% over the past month. Shares fell as much as 12.55% in the days following the its earnings report on Aug. 29. Still, the chipmaker’s shares have climbed around 156% so far this year. And compared with a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up over 190%. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Micron Technology's (MU) bullish outlook is driving its and chipmaking peers' shares higher in premarket trading; Costco Wholesale (COST) is expected to post both quarterly profit and sales gains after the bell; Meta Platforms (META) stock adds to record highs; OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization and give Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sam Altman a massive stake; and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell makes his first remarks today after last week's supersized interest-rate cut. U.S. stock futures—especially the tech-dominated Nasdaq—are rising on Micron's rosy outlook after indexes closed mixed Wednesday. Here's what investors need to know today. Micron Technology (MU) shares are jumping 16% in premarket trading after the memory chipmaker's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit in its fiscal fourth quarter and almost doubled revenue, buoyed by "robust AI demand," according to CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Micron's results lifted other chipmakers and semiconductor industry suppliers, with ASML Holding (ASML) jumping 4% and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia all up about 2%. Costco Wholesale (COST) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts projecting year-over-year growth on the top and bottom lines. It will be the retailer's first results since it raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years. Analysts are projecting very little further appreciation for the shares, which are edging higher in premarket trading and have climbed nearly 40% this year. Meta Platforms (META) shares, which hit an all-time high Wednesday, are rising a further 2% in premarket trading after the company unveiled new products at its annual Connect conference. In his keynote address, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new features for its smart glasses made in partnership with Ray-Ban, and new AI features, among other things. OpenAI reportedly is planning to restructure to become a for-profit organization, as the Microsoft (MSFT)-backed company struggles with an ongoing exodus of key personnel. According to Reuters, which first reported the plan, OpenAI is in talks to give CEO Sam Altman equity worth up to $150 billion, while Bloomberg said the company is discussing giving him a 7% stake. Meanwhile, OpenAI's long-serving Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Mira Murati was among those to announce a departure Wednesday. It's a big day for Federal Reserve speakers, among them Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at the 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference. Powell's speech will be his first since announcing last week's jumbo-sized interest-rate cut. Investors will also be on the lookout for comments from New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr on the health of the U.S. economy. Data due today include a revised estimate of second-quarter GDP.

Title: Nvidia Stock -- The Road To $200

Time Published: 2024-09-26T10:00:51Z

Visitors check out Nvidia's AI technology at the 2024 Apsara Conference in Hangzhou, China, on ... [+] September 19, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Could Nvidia stock reach $200 in the next two years? We think there is a possibility. How? Consider this, just about nine months ago, at the end of December 2023, Nvidia stock was trading at around $50 levels. This year the stock has grown over 2x since and trades at close to $116 presently. Looking at valuations, Nvidia stock trades at about 95x trailing earnings. Is this pricey? Not really. Especially if you consider the company’s steadily expanding earnings, the long-growth runway for the artificial intelligence market, and Nvidia’s formidable lead in the accelerated computing market. The Fed’s recent rate cut could also provide a boost as investors seek growth opportunities in a low-rate environment. In the scenario below, we use Nvidia’s revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $200 stock price. Nvidia’s revenues grew by close to 3x over the last 12 months, while notching an average annual growth rate of about 55% over the last three years, and the momentum can hold up. If Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next two years, its revenues could move from around $61 billion in FY’24 to around $155 billion by fiscal year 2026 or over 2.5x. There are several trends that could drive continued growth. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3-D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, unlike a decade or so ago when advancements in computing power, particularly with processors, outpaced the development software that could fully utilize these capabilities, in the AI era, the demand for computing power has skyrocketed due to the intense computational requirements of machine learning models. This trend could result in sustained strong demand for Nvidia. Moreover, last week’s monetary easing by the Federal Reserve could provide an additional boost to Nvidia. The Fed’s 0.5% rate cut last Wednesday marked the first interest rate cut in close to four years. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed’s next move? With the benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Lower rates are typically beneficial for growth sectors including technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years, as lower discount rates boost the present value of future earnings. The lower rates are particularly beneficial to Nvidia. Why? Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia which sells GPUs for servers. Moreover, the economics of the AI revolution remain mixed, given the high costs of model training and inferencing. A drop in interest rates could improve the financial feasibility of these investments. Now the stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We detail this possibility in our analysis of Nvidia’s downside to $40. Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock. To put things in perspective, NVDA stock swelled over 800% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $130 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA’s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular, as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Combine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory. They grew from levels of about 25% in FY 2019 to about 49% in FY 2024 as the company sees better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia’s launch of pricier higher-end products such as the Blackwell chips are offset by potential competitive pressures. Now, if earnings grow 2.5x, the PE multiple will shrink by 2.5x to levels of about 40x, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting won’t happen. If earnings expand 2.5x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 95x now to about 40x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 65x looks quite likely. This would make the growth of Nvidia’s stock about $200 within the next two years or so a real possibility. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes 2 years or 3, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly.

Title: Micron Stock Pops on Strong Outlook Driven by 'Robust AI Demand'

Micron Technology (MU) shares surged in extended trading Wednesday as the company's revenue and outlook blew past expectations. The memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner swung to a profit of $887 million or 79 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, from a loss of $1.43 billion or $1.31 per share a year ago. Revenue nearly doubled to $7.75 billion, topping analysts' estimates. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the revenue gains were driven by “robust AI demand," and that the company is moving into fiscal 2025 “with the best competitive positioning in Micron's history." Micron said it expects current-quarter revenue to reach a record high between $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion, with the low end of that range above the analyst consensus. The company's projection for diluted earnings per share (EPS) of between $1.46 and $1.62 also exceeded estimates. Shares of Micron jumped more than 13% to $108.34 in extended trading Wednesday following the release.

Title: Vistra Stock Powers Higher as Analysts Lift Price Targets

Shares of Texas-based power generator Vistra (VST) surged nearly 6% higher on Wednesday, the largest daily gain of any S&P 500 stock. Vistra is no stranger to market-leading upticks, having surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the top-performing stock in the benchmark index this year. Despite the run-up in Vistra's stock price in 2024, several investment firms suggested there could be more upside potential for shares of the utility company. In research notes published this week, Jefferies boosted its price target on Vistra shares to $137 from $99, while Morgan Stanley lifted its target on the stock to $132 from $110. Analysts described catalysts that could help Vistra stock extend its march higher. Jefferies pointed to the firm's acquisition last week of the remaining 15% noncontrolling interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary, which includes nuclear generation facilities as well other renewable and energy-storage assets. Analysts equated the Vision deal to buying back shares at a discount. The report from Jefferies also focused on the recent announcement from fellow electricity generator Constellation Energy (CEG) that it will restart a shuttered nuclear plant to provide power to Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. The analyst team believes the deal "confirms and expands" their thesis that Vistra stands to benefit from data-center opportunities, while the terms of the 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) between Constellation and the software giant set a precedent for lucrative agreements in the future. So far in 2024, Vistra shares have more than tripled in value.
