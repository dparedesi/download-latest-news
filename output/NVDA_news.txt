This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Intel was one of only two tech stocks - the other being Microsoft - to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the dot-com bubble of the 90s. Chronic under performance, however, has consequences, and Intel is now being replaced with the poster child of the ongoing AI mania, NVIDIA, within the iconic index. $NVDA, $INTC [Nvidia to join Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel] — NOTRELOAD AI (@thudderwicks) November 1, 2024 To wit, we had noted about a month back that Intel was likely to get booted off the Dow Jones index as part of its upcoming rebalancing. Bear in mind that the DJIA rebalances quarterly, when stocks are added or removed systematically from the market cap-weighed index based on an extensive criteria. Now, that prognostication has panned out, with NVIDIA replacing Intel within the benchmark index. Of course, this development comes as Intel is showing nascent signs of stabilization. For the third quarter of 2024, Intel not only exceeded Wall Street's consensus revenue estimate but also provided a relatively upbeat guidance. However, the stock's initial euphoric reaction was tempered by the qualifier given by Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, within the ensuing earnings call, wherein he conceded that the uptake of the AI accelerator Gaudi 3 was "slower than expected" and, therefore, the chipmaker would miss its $500 Million initial target for AI Accelerators. Of course, as we reported recently, Amazon has now emerged as the anchor customer for Intel's chip fabrication ambitions. In the first phase of their planned collaboration, the chipmaker will leverage its "Intel 3" process to build a custom Xeon 6 chip for Amazon's data center workloads. In the second phase, the company will produce an "AI fabric chip" for Amazon's AWS on its 18A manufacturing process, which is compatible with TSMC's 2nm process and is expected to enter the commercial phase in 2025. Meanwhile, Intel is still waiting for the Biden Administration to start releasing the grants and loans that were promised under the CHIPS Act.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Intel will lose its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after a 25-year run to Nvidia, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday, the latest blow to the struggling chipmaker that was among the first two technology firms to be included in the blue-chip index. Once the dominant force in chipmaking, Intel has in recent years ceded its manufacturing edge to rival TSMC and missed out on the generative artificial intelligence boom after missteps including passing on an investment in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI. Intel’s shares (INTC) have declined 54% this year, making it the worst performer on the index and leaving it with the lowest stock price on the price-weighted Dow. The stock fell about 1% in extended trading on Friday, while Nvidia (NVDA) was up 1.5%. Launched in 1968, the Silicon Valley pioneer sold memory chips before switching to processors that helped launch the personal computer industry. In the 1990s, “Intel Inside” stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. Nvidia has emerged as a cornerstone of the global semiconductor industry, thanks to the essential role its chips play in powering generative AI technologies which has driven a seven-fold surge in its shares over the past two years. The company’s shares have risen more than two-fold this year alone. Once popular only among gamers who hunted for PCs with Nvidia’s graphics processors, the company is now the second-most valuable in the world and is seen as a barometer for the AI market. The company’s 10-for-one stock split in June also helped pave the way for its addition to the index, making its soaring shares more accessible to retail traders.

Title: Nvidia to replace Intel in Dow Jones Industrial Average

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Arsheeya Bajwa (Reuters) -Intel (INTC) will be replaced by Nvidia (NVDA) on the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average index after a 25-year run, underscoring the shift in the chipmaking market and marking another setback for the struggling semiconductor firm. Nvidia will join the index next week along with paint-maker Sherwin-Williams , which will replace Dow, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday. Once the dominant force in chipmaking, Intel has in recent years ceded its manufacturing edge to rival TSMC and missed out on the generative artificial intelligence boom after missteps including passing on an investment in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI. Intel's shares have declined 54% this year, making the company the worst performer on the index and leaving it with the lowest stock price on the price-weighted Dow. Shares of Intel fell 1.6% in extended trading on Friday, while those of Nvidia were up 2.2%. This development comes a day after Intel expressed optimism about the future of its PC and server businesses, projecting current-quarter revenue above estimates but warning that it had "a lot of work to do." "Losing the status of Dow Jones inclusion would be another reputational blow for Intel, as it grapples with a painful transformation and loss of confidence," said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. "It would also mean that Intel is not included in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which track the index, which could impact the share price further." Launched in 1968, the Silicon Valley pioneer sold memory chips before switching to processors that helped launch the personal computer industry. In the 1990s, "Intel Inside" stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. Intel's revenue was $54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from 2021, when Pat Gelsinger took over as CEO. Analysts expect Intel to report its first annual net loss this year since 1986. The company is worth less than $100 billion for the first time in 30 years. That pales in comparison to Nvidia, which is sitting at a $3.32 trillion valuation, making it the world's second-most valuable company. NVIDIA'S AI LEAD Nvidia has emerged as a cornerstone of the global semiconductor industry, thanks to the essential role its chips play in powering generative AI technologies which has driven a seven-fold surge in its shares over the past two years. The company's shares have risen more than two-fold this year alone. Once popular only among gamers who hunted for PCs with Nvidia's graphics processors, it is now seen as a barometer for the AI market. The company's 10-for-one stock split that took effect in June also helped pave the way for its addition to the index, making its soaring shares more accessible to retail traders. Intel, on the other hand, has struggled to gain share in the AI chip market dominated by Nvidia, with the front-runner's chips hard to get and even harder to replace in AI datacenters, owing to the processors' technological edge and the high costs of replacing them.

Title: Amazon is still figuring out Alexa's AI brain

A decade after making waves with its voice assistant, Alexa, Amazon (AMZN+6.19%) seems to be struggling to bring it into the generative artificial intelligence era. During the company’s third-quarter earnings call, Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said the company is continuing “to rearchitect the brain” of its voice assistant with a set of next-generation foundation models — or larger models trained on broad, generalized data sets. “When we first were pursuing Alexa, we had this vision of it being the world’s best personal assistant and people thought that was kind of a crazy idea,” David Fildes, Amazon vice president of investor relations, said. “And I think if you look at what’s happened in generative AI over the last couple of years, I think you’re kind of missing the boat if you don’t believe that’s going to happen. It absolutely is going to happen.” By rearchitecting Alexa with its foundation models, Fildes said Amazon believes it has “an opportunity to be the leader” in the next generation of voice assistants and generative AI applications. The next generation, he said, will not only be better at answering questions and summarizing data, “but also taking actions.” Jassy said Amazon would share the new models with customers soon, and that the company is “increasingly adding more AI into all of our devices,” including the Kindle. Amazon declined to share more specifics on its release plans in an email to Quartz. Alexa AI’s postponed release is due to technical challenges, Bloomberg reported earlier this week, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. One person told the publication that Amazon’s Alexa AI teams were recently told their target deadline is now in 2025. In June, Fortune reported that the AI-powered Alexa — which Amazon demoed last September and said would be available for a free preview on its Alexa-fitted devices in the U.S. — is not even close to being ready. Former employees told the publication that the company doesn’t have enough data nor access to the chips needed to run the large language model (LLM) powering the new version of its voice assistant. The company also reportedly deprioritized Alexa AI to focus on building generative AI for its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. Amazon said its former employees are incorrect and uninformed on its current Alexa AI efforts, and that the Amazon Artificial General Intelligence team has access to both in-house Trainium chips and Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.99%) graphics processing units (GPUs). “We have already integrated generative AI into different components of Alexa, and are working hard on implementation at scale—in the over half a billion ambient, Alexa-enabled devices,” an Amazon spokesperson previously told Quartz in a statement. “We are excited about what we’re building and look forward to delivering it for our customers.” On Amazon’s third-quarter earnings call, Jassy said Amazon has a “very deep partnership with Nvidia” and plans to “be their lead partner on most of their new chips.” Production of the second version of Amazon’s training chips, Trainium, will start ramping up in the next few weeks, Jassy said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped, set for a comeback on Friday as investors digested a big miss in the monthly jobs report, and welcomed Amazon (AMZN) and Intel (INTC) earnings. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged 1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.8%, both coming off a steep selloff fueled by worries about Big Tech's AI spending. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added roughly 0.8%. Markets took in their stride the disappointing headline numbers in the all-important jobs report. The US economy added just 12,000 jobs in October, significantly missing expectations. The government said those numbers were weighed down by recent hurricanes and strike activity, most prominently at Boeing (BA). The report is the last major economic data before the Federal Reserve's next policy decision on Nov. 7. Market expectations for that meeting moved little in its wake, with traders pricing in about 98% odds of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed meeting next week, per CME FedWatch. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Meanwhile, upbeat earnings from Amazon helped dissipate the gloom around Big Tech's prospects that drove Thursday's slump in stocks. Its shares jumped over 6% in morning trading after CEO Andy Jassy said its cloud unit's AI business was seeing triple-digit revenue growth. Morale also got a lift from Intel's (INTC) earnings beat and outlook, which revived hopes for the chipmaker's turnaround and boosted the stock. But Apple (AAPL) shares slipped as its results and outlook left Wall Street wanting more. Elsewhere in corporates, Boeing shares tipped higher after the union backed its latest offer to end a significant factory workers' strike. The sweetened deal would lift wages by 38%. Meanwhile, oil prices rose over 2% amid revived Mideast fears, after a report that Iran is planning a strike on Israel via militias that it backs in Iraq. Brent (BZ=F) crude futures traded at around $74 a barrel after briefly nudging $75, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures were not far off the $71 level. Wall Street positioned itself for a turnaround Friday after a strong showing from Amazon (AMZN) lifted investor sentiment. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) popped 0.5% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.4%, both coming off steep losses fueled by after-earnings tumbles in Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.4%. But impressive reports from Amazon and Intel (INTC) set stocks on a comeback trajectory. On Thursday night, Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects to spend "more than that" in 2025, showing investors that heavy AI spending can coincide with profit growth. Amazon (AMZN) and Intel (INTC) stocks jumped Friday, lifting Nvidia (NVDA) shares with them. Amazon stock jumped as much as 7% premarket as the company proved it can balance hefty AI spending with profit growth. The company’s profit jumped more than 50% to over $17 billion in the third quarter, and its 11% operating margin came in above Wall Street’s expectations of just over 9%. At the same time, CEO Andy Jassy said the company will likely rack up $75 billion in expenses for the full year and spend even more next year. That’s good news for Nvidia, which rose 1.5% premarket. The AI chipmakers’ shares had fallen a day earlier amid fears of moderating AI spending from Big Tech firms. The stock was also helped by positive sentiment on Intel, which itself jumped 7.6% premarket after giving an upbeat fourth quarter outlook. Intel’s guidance lifted chip stocks across the board after a rough few days. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) fell roughly 2% on weaker-than-expected China sales, a hefty EU tax payment and a soft sales outlook for the current period. Apple projected sales will rise in the low-to-mid single digits in the December quarter, lower than the 7% expected by analysts. The US economy added just 12,000 jobs in October, fewer than the 100,000 economists expected. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%. Recent strike activity, most prominently at Boeing (BA), and weather-related disruptions weighed on the labor market last month, the government said.

Title: Mizuho: NVIDIA Might Miss Its Guidance If Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Fails To Find Operational Funding

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a retailer of high-performance servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, is in a veritable maelstrom at the moment, battling allegations of financial malfeasance, a preliminary DOJ investigation, an audit-related nightmare where the firm has lost its second auditor in around 18 months, and an imminent de-listing from the Nasdaq exchange. Now, a Mizuho analyst is arguing that NVIDIA might not be able to emerge from this saga unscathed, especially as Super Micro Computer constitutes its third-largest customer. Mizuho on $SMCI $NVDA $DELL Klein also warns that SMCI supplier NVIDIA is now at risk of missing guidance if SMCI cannot fund their business as they operate with negative working capital and require a lot of cash and funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid cooling… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) October 31, 2024 To wit, Mizuho believes that, as an enterprise with a negative working capital paradigm that necessitates extensive external funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid-cooled products "to build multi-million dollar NVL72 Blackwell rack systems," Super Micro Computer might not be able to tap the requisite external liquidity in the coming days, owing to a growing host of risk factors. Should SMCI face a funding deficit, it will have a direct bearing on NVIDIA, which is "now at risk of missing guidance," as per Mizuho's assessment. The analyst goes on to note: "My view is any customer that does not want the risk of missing a deadline or financial target due to issues related to SMCI is going to move their AI server business to another supplier, like DELL." Meanwhile, as noted above, Super Micro Computer's travails are only getting more entrenched. First, Hindenburg Research leveled hard-hitting allegations against Super Micro Computer back in August, asserting that the server provider engaged in distribution channel stuffing by pushing products to distributors based on artificially inflated demand forecasts, undertook partial shipments to meet specific sales targets and inflated its total shipment count in the process, re-hired top executives responsible for "widespread accounting violations" that had resulted in a $17.5 million settlement with the SEC, and paid nearly a billion dollars over the past three years to non-arm's-length suppliers such as Ablecom and Compuware. BREAKING: Super Micro Computer was warned if it fails to provide an audited compliance plan by Nov 16, it will be delisted from the Nasdaq. This news comes 1 day after auditor Ernst & Young resigned. $SMCI is $NVDA's 3rd largest customer & heavy user of $NVDA's vendor financing. https://t.co/SQKE9Oc3zB pic.twitter.com/cBSEFfFVQi — Financelot (@FinanceLancelot) October 31, 2024 In the aftermath, Super Micro Computer delayed the filing of its annual report for the fiscal year that ended on the 30th of June, 2024, presumably in a bid to undertake a comprehensive internal review. Under the prevailing statutory requirements, that report had to be filed by the 30th of August. What's more, SMCI's continuing dilatory tactics have now attracted the wrath of the Nasdaq exchange, which has warned of a potential de-listing action should the firm fail to file the requisite annual report by the 16th of November. What's more, the DOJ has also reportedly launched an investigation into the affairs at Super Micro Computer, with a particular focus on the alleged accounting violations. Elsewhere, as we recently reported, Ernst & Young (EY) sent a letter to Super Micro Computer's audit committee earlier this week, tendering its resignation as the company's officially designated accounting firm: “We are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.” Bear in mind that, with EY's resignation, Super Micro Computer has lost its second auditor in around 18 months. $SMCI said it "disagreed" with the accounting firm's decision and does not expect the "resolution of any matters raised by EY" to result in the restatement of its quarterly reports for fiscal 2024 or prior fiscal years. — NOTRELOAD AI (@thudderwicks) October 30, 2024 Interestingly, throughout this saga, SMCI has continued to profess innocence and has maintained that its annual report for the fiscal year 2024 will not undergo "any material changes." Over the past five trading days, Super Micro Computer shares have recorded a whopping loss of 37 percent.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq led a tumble in US stocks on Thursday after Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Techs amid rising artificial intelligence costs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%, as both indexes ended the month slightly in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also notched a monthly loss after dropping 0.9% on Thursday. The monthly declines snapped five straight months of gains for the S&P 500 and Dow. Optimism for a Big Tech boost to stocks took a knock as investors digested Meta's and Microsoft's quarterly reports. While the results beat Wall Street estimates, both companies flagged that they will step up already high spending on AI infrastructure. Concerns that would put pressure on profitability helped send shares in both Meta and Microsoft lower. The unsettled mood spread to Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which rounded off this week's "Magnificent Seven" earnings with reports after the close on Thursday. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) also fell over 4.5%. After the bell, the mood around Amazon improved, as its stock popped after the tech giant topped Wall Street's estimates for both revenue and earnings per share. Meanwhile, Apple shares slid slightly as a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision weighed on the company's earnings per share. On the macroeconomic front, investors received the latest reading on the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which largely matched expectations. The reading is the last key inflation input for the Federal Reserve before its policy decision next week. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards In jobs-related data, initial jobless claims declined to a five-month low of 216,000, lower than estimates. Next up is the all-important jobs report on Friday. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Apple (AAPL) announced its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, giving Wall Street its first look at whether the company’s Apple Intelligence platform is juicing iPhone sales. For the quarter, Apple saw earnings per share (EPS) of $0.97 on revenue of $94.9 billion. The company says it saw a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision that requires Apple to pay 13 billion euros to Ireland for back taxes. Without the charge, EPS would have come in at $1.64. That would have blown past expectations of $1.59 per share and revenue of $94.3 billion. The company reported EPS of $1.46 on revenue of $89.4 billion during the same period last year. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Intel (INTC) reported its Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday beating expectations on revenue, but falling short on earnings per share due to impairment charges. But positive Q4 guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher by as much as 12% following the report. For the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of $13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read more here. Amazon (AMZN) stock popped as much as 5% after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected. The company also said it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecasted $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said Operating income is expected to be between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall treet had projected $17.49 billion. Read more here. Big Tech led Thursday's losses, with all three averages ending lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) notched a monthly loss, dropping 0.9%. All three averages closed out October slightly in the red. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Tech amid rising artificial intelligence costs, with those stocks losing more than 4% and 6%, respectively. All of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks fell, with Al chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 4.5%. A slew of tech earnings are set to hit the tape again after the bell. Below is what Wall Street is expecting: Amazon: Amazon is expected to report earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Read the full preview. Apple: For the quarter, Wall Street expects Apple to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 on revenue of $94.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Read the full preview. Intel: For the quarter, Intel is expected to report a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read the full preview. Both Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) topped Wall Street's estimates for revenue and earnings per share. But both also talked about ramping up spending on artificial intelligence, which appeared to weigh on sentiment as each stock slumped about 5% on Thursday. Microsoft's capital expenditures picked up to $20 billion in the most recent quarter from $19 billion the quarter prior. CFO Amy Hood said the company is ramping up investments in response to "AI demands." The company did, however, note that the extra spend is weighing on Microsoft's margins. For its part, Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year capital expenditures from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li made a rather ambiguous statement about spending plans moving forward, saying the company expects "significant capital expenditure growth in 2025." The chart below shows a clear trend in growing capital expenditures. The companies say it's going to drive future revenues. For now, the market appears not to love it. But whether it will work in the long run remains a looming question that doesn't have a clear answer. RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote about Microsoft on Thursday, “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions, and would be a buyer on weakness." The October jobs report is expected to show job gains slowed significantly during the month as recent hurricanes and a strike by Boeing workers weigh on the labor market. The monthly report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 105,000 in October while the unemployment rate held flat at 4.1%, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. This would mark the lowest monthly number of job additions since December 2020. In September, the US economy shocked Wall Street by adding 254,000 jobs, well above consensus estimates. The unemployment rate declined to 4.1%. Here are the key numbers Wall Street will be looking at on Friday morning compared to the previous month, according to data from Bloomberg: Read more here.

AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) was down more than 4% along with other semiconductor stocks. Among Big Tech's declinersoftware giant Microsoft (MSFT) fell more than 5% following its quarterly results. Social media company Meta (META) fell roughly 4% after indicating it will step up spending on AI infrastructure next year. Amazon (AMZN), set to report earnings after the bell, also dropped more than 3%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its double-digit declines on Thursday as the stock reversed sizable gains from earlier in the week. Shares fell around 15% and trading was briefly halted due to volatility. As Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports, the massive swings come as the stock suffered its largest percent decline on Wednesday after shares plunged around 22%. Since Tuesday, more than $3 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock is still up roughly 130% from its September lows. Read more here. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock dropped nearly 14%, extending declines of 33% in the prior session to erase all of its year-to-date gains, as some Wall Street analysts backed away from covering the stock after accounting firm Ernst & Young resigned during the company's audit. On Thursday, Argus downgraded the server maker to Hold from Buy, with no price target. Meanwhile analysts at Needham and Wells Fargo suspended coverage of the company. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Comcast (CMCSA) said Thursday that it has started exploring spinning off its cable networks into a separate company. The development comes as the media industry undergoes massive disruption, with more consumers cutting the cord, or dropping their pay-TV packages. Comcast stock rose more than 2% on Thursday morning.

The stock gained more than 3% in early trading on Thursday. Read more here. Tech stocks led the major averages lower on Thursday following quarterly results from social media giant Meta (META) and software maker Microsoft (MSFT). The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped roughly 0.5%. Meta said it would increase capital spending significantly in 2025, while Microsoft's cloud growth forecast disappointed Wall Street as the company races to expand its AI infrastructure. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks sank premarket as investors weighed their hefty artificial intelligence expenditures against the time it will take to generate a return on their investment. Meta fell as much as 4.7% before paring losses, while Microsoft was down 3.6%. During their earnings reports the night before, both companies beat Wall Street’s expectations, but Microsoft’s weaker-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter and Meta’s raised outlook on capital expenditures appeared to spook investors. Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year spending from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li said the company expects “significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.” Microsoft indicated in its fiscal first quarter earnings reports that spending on general artificial intelligence infrastructure (e.g., AI chips) weighed on gross margins, which it expects to continue in the current period. Microsoft justified the spending by saying the demand for its AI products is real and that infrastructure spending is necessary to continue to meet that demand. “Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond,” said Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. Meta said it’s seeing “rapid adoption of Meta AI.” RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria said to buy the dip on Microsoft: “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions.” Analysts also reiterated their Buy ratings on Meta stock.

And I will tell you why: new CEO Brian Niccol. I have known Niccol for about 10 years, going back to his time leading Taco Bell at Yum! Brands (YUM). One thing among many that I have noticed about him is how he really digs into problems and calmly articulates them — and an action plan — to team members and investors. That was the same Niccol who senior reporter Brooke DiPalma and I encountered last night in a 15-minute post-earnings call phone chat. Such calm under fire will prove to be a good thing for Starbucks, as it has many, many problems to address. Niccol seemingly has more knowledge about Starbucks in his first three months than the prior CEO gained in more than a year! He is wasting no time fixing things at Starbucks, as Brooke reports here. But here is one exchange I had with him on the phone regarding the need to slash the menu size by 25% or more. Cutting the Starbucks menu down is vitally important to driving a better business on the top and bottom lines. It's good to see Niccol understand this (he made it a point to keep the Chipotle (CMG) menu small, carefully introducing a new item or two a year after thorough testing), as his predecessors never did.

Title: Nvidia stock sinks on fears of AI spending slowdown

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell nearly 5% Thursday on investor fears of a slowdown in artificial intelligence spending and potential delivery delays of its AI chips. Semiconductor stocks suffered across the board. The PHLX semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 4%, slumping more than the broader market. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 3%, while Intel dropped 3.5%, Qualcomm (QCOM) sank 2.9%, and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 3.9%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged 8.5%. Microsoft (MSFT), in its earnings report late Wednesday, indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from “third parties” weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software. “Microsoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can’t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,” wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance. Nvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Persistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen. “As long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow … the growth in capex will slow and the revenue growth will increase,” she said. “The pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.” Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), in its third quarter earnings report, said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. “As we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,” said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company’s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be “likely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.” Advanced Micro Devices’ quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well, as the company’s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday. To be sure, Big Tech companies’ AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft’s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google’s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on megacap tech stocks Thursday. Meta said it expects "significant capital expenditure growth in 2025." Nvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 84% to $0.74 and revenue to climb 83% to $33 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Nvidia and other AI stocks are getting dragged down by Microsoft and Meta
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-smci-amd-mu-avgo-ai-stocks-down-microsoft-and-me-1851686429
Time Published: 2024-10-31T17:01:32Z

Despite posting robust quarterly profits, Microsoft (MSFT+0.98%) and Meta (META-0.08%) shares slumped Thursday as both tech giants signaled substantial future AI spending requirements and slower growth prospects. The companies that have emerged as leaders in the AI sector saw their stocks decline despite heavy investments in generative AI that had previously fueled investor optimism. The downward pressure rippled through the broader AI ecosystem, dragging down shares of key semiconductor and hardware providers. Nvidia (NVDA+1.99%) fell 4.5%, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-1.55%) dropped 2.8%, Micron Technology (MU+0.07%) slid 4.4%, and Broadcom (AVGO-0.44%) was down 4.8%. Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer (SMCI-10.53%) faced an even steeper decline, plummeting 15% amid an ongoing dispute with its auditor. The AI hardware company is now at risk of potential delisting from the Nasdaq, adding further uncertainty for investors. In Microsoft’s (MSFT+0.98%) third-quarter earnings report Wednesday evening, it acknowledged that it can’t build data centers fast enough to meet the AI demand. Microsoft’s “inability to build data centres fast enough has constrained its guidance for the coming quarter,” Richard Windsor, founder of Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. During a post-earnings call with analysts, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company has run into external constraints due to high demand for artificial intelligence training and inferencing. “[Data centers] don’t get built overnight,” Nadella said. “Even in Q2 for example, some of the demand issues we have, or rather our ability to fulfill demand is because of, in fact, external third-party stuff that we leased moving up. That’s the constraints we have.” The tech giant’s shares were down over 5% during trading on Thursday, trading at $409 per share. The stock is approaching its worst performance in months, having dropped nearly 2% over the past three months. Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META-0.08%) has invested billions of dollars into artificial intelligence as it looks to keep pace with its Magnificent 7 competitors. The tech giant warned that this spending will only grow into next year and beyond. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg gave analysts a hint of what some of those investments could look like on a call Wednesday but said the company would offer more details once it finalizes its budget in the fourth quarter. “First, it’s clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years,” Zuckerberg said. “So, I think we should invest more there.” “And second, our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there too,” he added. The shares of Meta were down 3.75% on Thursday afternoon. – Britney Nguyen and Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI-10.53%) fell an additional 15% on Thursday, trading at $28 per share, following the resignation of auditor Ernst & Young. Although the server company joined the S&P 500 in March 2024, this year hasn’t been smooth, and now it faces potential delisting from the Nasdaq. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. Meanwhile, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh has maintained a neutral rating and a $45 stock price target amid concerns over the company’s internal financial controls. The company faced a recent setback when its accountant, Ernst & Young, decided to resign after months of disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. The conflicts between Ernst & Young and Super Micro Computer began in late July, as the auditor raised concerns regarding the company’s internal financial controls, governance, and transparency. In response, Super Micro formed a special board committee to investigate the issues. But Ernst & Young ultimately concluded it could no longer stand behind the company’s financial statements. In its resignation letter, EY said it was “unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management,” citing recent information that allegedly made it impossible to rely on representations from Super Micro’s executives and audit committee. The San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.99%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following these accusations, Super Micro’s stock price took a significant hit. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course. Despite the recent sharp downturn, the firm’s current price remains nearly 13% higher than it was a year ago. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Buy Dell stock on SMCI's auditor woes - analyst

Investing.com --- AI server maker Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) plunged 33% on Wednesday and is down another 12% today after the company disclosed that its registered public accountant Ernst & Young LLP resigned amid an audit of the company fiscal year results. Amid the chaos at SMCI, analysts say another AI server maker stands to benefit – Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL). Dell rose 6% on Wednesday, but Mizuho desk analyst Jordan Klein thinks there is more upside and is now bullish on the stock. “If you are not paying attention to the mess that is SMCI, you should,” Klein said. As a result, the analyst sees material upside for Dell over the next two to three quarters and would remain a buyer on any weakness. “My view is any customer that does not want the risk of missing a deadline or financial target due to issues related to SMCI is going to move their AI server business to another supplier, like DELL,” the analyst added. Klein also warns that SMCI supplier NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is now at risk of missing guidance if SMCI cannot fund their business as they operate with negative working capital and require a lot of cash and funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid cooling product to build multi-million dollar NVL72 Blackwell rack systems. “NVDA will probably start to move the majority of their GPU supply away from SMCI until they get clarity on the situation,” the analyst states. He said this benefits Dell. With SMCI potentially hamstrung, this “removes a price aggressor on Gen AI server rates systems," according to the analyst. “Dell walked away from large tier one cloud supply agreements over weak margins (they preferred not to lose money on the revenues),” the analyst said. “Their focused on profitable tier 2 cloud customers. But maybe they can go back and WIN TIER 1 CLOUD SERVER DEALS WITH MORE GPU SUPPLY AND LESS PRICING PRESSURE FROM SMCI.” Dell stock is down 3% in early trading Thursday.

Title: AMD still has a gap to close with Nvidia's AI chips
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amd-earnings-q3-2024-ceo-lisa-su-nvidia-ai-chips-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-30T18:35:26Z

During Advanced Micro Devices' third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, CEO Lisa Su said the company had "closed a good part of" the gap with Nvidia, its AI rival. But AMD still lags behind Nvidia in the market for GPUs, or graphics processing units, which are heavily used in training AI models because they can process large datasets. Nvidia controls more than 80% of the market. AMD said revenue increased by 18% year over year, primarily because of gains in its data-center segment, including sales of its Instinct GPU and its EPYC CPU. At the same time, analysts raised concerns about a delay in AMD's GPU offerings. This month, AMD said its new-generation MI325X accelerator chip would begin production this year and become widely available in early 2025. It also plans to release its MI350 chip next year to compete with Nvidia's highly anticipated Blackwell chip, which is expected to start shipping in the fourth quarter. Though AMD's performance was about what Wall Street analysts had expected, its stock price dipped by as much as 10% on Wednesday. On the earnings call, Vivek Arya, a Bank of America Securities analyst, described AMD's chips as "kind of one year behind the industry leader." "Can you really gain share until that gap is closed?" he asked. Su responded that AMD's road map had "actually closed a good part of that gap" with Nvidia's products and that AMD held an advantage in data-center retrofitting. "I think MI325 is a great product," Su said. "It's going to compete very well with H200, and the MI350 series will compete very well with Blackwell." When Harsh Kumar, a Piper Sandler semiconductor analyst, asked what was hindering AMD from becoming a bigger player in the GPU market, Su said that acquiring the total addressable market takes time. It can also take years to design and test chips with more processing capacity. "We had an extremely good product even back in the ROM days," Su said. "But it does take time to ensure that there is trust built, there is familiarity with the product." Analysts said that while AMD got a later start in GPUs than Nvidia, it's slowly chipping away at Nvidia's lead in the AI boom. "As much as we still believe NVDA will be hard to shake from its 80-85% AI share, AMD still has done an enviable job from virtually zero to ~5% market share," Arya wrote in a note released on Wednesday. Even if this share remains unchanged, he added, the underlying AI growth will give AMD "the chance to participate." Morgan Stanley also bumped up its estimates of AMD's growth for the next year to $8 billion, though its analysts raised concerns about customer usage. AMD's customers include Microsoft, Meta, and Google. "Our checks continue to show several customers that are committed to using AMD architecture, but actual usage still seems relatively small," Morgan Stanley's equity analysts said. Jump to

Title: Super Micro Computer Stock Plummets as EY Resigns as Company's Auditor

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged Wednesday after accounting firm EY resigned as the company's auditor following months of speculation about the company's accounting practices. EY, one of the country's "Big Four" accounting firms, told Super Micro Computer's board the decision comes "due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations." EY added it is "unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management." Super Micro Computer said it disagreed with EY's decision, as the audit it hired EY last year to complete isn't done yet, and that it takes the concerns the accounting firm raised about "whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity" seriously. The resignation comes as Super Micro Computer's stock has tumbled in recent months amid speculation about its accounting practices after it delayed the filing of its annual 10-K and a report from short seller Hindenburg Research alleging "accounting manipulation" and other issues. Last month, reports emerged that the Department of Justice had opened an investigation into Super Micro Computer's accounting practices following the Hindenburg report. Following EY's resignation, Hindenburg founder Nate Anderson said the firm's letter of resignation is "about as strongly worded as I have seen," and suggested EY's decision could make partners like Nvidia (NVDA) question doing business with Super Micro Computer going forward. Super Micro Computer shares were down nearly 30% in early trading Wednesday at $35.71, though even with Wednesday's losses, they've gained about one-quarter of their value since the start of the year.

OpenAI is undoubtedly a winner in the current artificial intelligence boom — and now it’s reportedly developing its own chips to power its growth. The ChatGPT maker is working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+1.25%) and Broadcom (AVGO-0.44%) to make its own in-house AI chips as demand for infrastructure grows, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. It reportedly also is adding Advanced Micro Devices’s (AMD-1.55%) AI chips to diversify supply from Nvidia (NVDA+1.99%). The company has reportedly considered ways to diversify its supply of chips and cut costs, including by raising capital for a network of chipmaking factories. But instead of the plan for foundries — which it has dropped for now — OpenAI is focusing on designing its own chips in-house, Reuters reported. OpenAI’s work with Broadcom on its first in-house chips for AI inferencing has been going on for months, people told Reuters, adding that while demand is currently higher for AI training chips, analysts expect AI inferencing to eventually take the lead. Inferencing, which comes after training, is the process of a trained AI model making predictions from new data. Two people told Reuters that OpenAI is still deciding between either developing or acquiring other features for its AI chip, and could find more chipmaking partners. OpenAI has been able to establish manufacturing capacity with TSMC through its partnership with Broadcom, Reuters reported. The Taiwanese chipmaker reportedly could have OpenAI’s first custom-designed chip by 2026, but that is not certain. Neither OpenAI, TSMC, nor Broadcom immediately responded to a request for comment. In September, OpenAI released a series of “reasoning” AI models that it said are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond.” OpenAI completed a $6.6 billion funding round earlier this month, giving it a valuation of $157 billion.

Eric Beiley, executive managing director of The Beiley Group at Steward Partners, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): It could be a crazy week for earnings. We got tech on deck. What are your expectations? ERIC BEILEY (EB): Expectations are high. The markets are trading near their highs. For the S&P 500, the markets are saying we’ve seen good earnings so far, and then this week is critical, right? You have the big Magnificent Seven names, Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), all reporting. AM: The Mag 7 are all at or near all time highs. They’ve been a part of a big wave of growth. How high can they go? Should investors keep investing in these seven-ish tech names? EB: I would say yes, because they’ve proven over the long term to produce tremendous results for investors, for their shareholders, and they continue to grow. So, and some of them, you could argue the valuations are, are attractive here, but it’s gonna be important to see what their, what their numbers are. Clearly. AM: One of the things that I am sure we’ll get some kind of read on is their spending on AI. Do you think that the market could react badly if investors don’t see a particular result in that spending yet? Or is it too early to tell? EB: No, I think AI is a major long-term powerful trend. You can’t ignore it, right? We’ve seen it. Look at Nvidia (NVDA) now, one of the largest companies in the world as demand for their chips is off the charts. And that’s because of this AI phenomena. And so Meta (META), formerly Facebook, Amazon, they’re all in that business for the long-term, investing billions of dollars. So I think AI is a long-term trend that’s gonna be positive for the markets and investors. AM: Tech is still okay. What other recommendations do you have for investors out there? EB: Well, clearly there’s a lot going on, right? You have this Friday, you have the employment numbers. That’s gonna be very important to see the health of the economy. And that’s gonna dictate where Fed policy goes, expectations are a few more rate hikes. We’re seeing that in the yield curve and that that’s positive for asset classes in general. Lower rates is positive. Then you have the election, clearly, right? That’s gonna be massive. The markets are right now trading based on what the predictions are for the election. So that’s very important. And then after that, you have the Fed meeting to show what their thoughts are. Are they gonna cut rates again? AM: The election. It’s gonna be a thing.Is there a way that investors can prepare for that? Should they sell everything? Should they double down? Like, not to be drastic or dramatic, but what do you think? EB: Well, as a financial advisor, we look for long-term goals to meet my client’s objectives. These are 5, 10, 15, 20-year financial plans we put together. So while this election is massive and very emotional for a lot of people, you have to look at the long-term. You have to look at your own situation and make those decisions. I think traders, we’re seeing it. The trading activity is certainly active right now, predicting whether Harris or Trump wins. You’re seeing right now, in my view, the markets are predicting a Trump victory. You’re seeing certain asset classes doing well that would perform a better in a Trump presidency, AM: Such as? EB: Crypto, number one. Clearly you’re seeing that the media stock for Trump has gone up tremendously in the last just week or so. So that’s showing signs that the markets are leaning toward Trump. AM: What is the market expecting for Friday’s Job number? EB: I think a good number. The markets again are acting extremely well. You’re seeing equity prices continue to go higher. The interesting part of the market now is where the rates, right, the long end of the yield curve, the 10-year treasury yields and longer have really gone up. And that’s predicting that the economy’s gonna stay strong and healthy. And therefore, while we’ll see more rate cuts, [there will be] not as many as predicted. And so Friday’s going to I think we’ll see a strong number and so the Fed will cut rates, but a small reduction and probably pause sometime next year in their cuts. AM: Gotcha. So it sounds like we’re in a good place right now, despite all of the news that’ll be coming out. EB: The trends are very positive and trends are powerful, right? Don’t fight trends, typically, for investors. Right now, the trends are higher and you have good signals out there. You’re having good third quarter results from companies. You have a good economy, rates coming down. All of those are very positive for asset classes in general. AM: Your firm is a fan of something called ‘dividend aristocrats’. Can you tell me about what a dividend aristocrat is and what your picks are? EB: Yeah, well I’m a fan of dividend aristocrats. So these are companies that have proven to be great long term investments because they share their profits with their shareholders. So they are doing that through dividends and they’ve increased their dividend payments every year for 25 consecutive years, which is hard to do, right? Because you think back over 25 years, there’s all types of economic cycles. Companies go through ups and downs and these companies have proven to increase their dividend payouts consecutively. And so I like these companies. There are three, I like Walmart (WMT), S&P Global (SPGI), and Brown and Company, the insurance company. They’ve all outperformed the S&P 500 on a 5- and 10-year basis. So, to me, these are great long-term investments. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

By Oliver Rodzianko Summary Intel (INTC, Financial) has recently been unfavorable among technology investors, primarily due to its poor results in the second quarter. Management has outlined a significant cost reduction plan in light of this, but past notions that it may leapfrog Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial)—also known as 'TSMC'—in manufacturing capability are no longer viable. Despite this, the stock is selling significantly cheaper than historically, and with Intel likely to deliver strong growth in FY25, I think this is a viable time to buy based on value. In the next 12 months, I see a market cap increase of approximately 50% as likely for the company. However, the longer-term returns seem less promising to me, given how the competitive market in chip design and manufacturing is developing. Operational analysis Firstly, readers need to place Intel’s recent 50% stock price decline into context. The company reported weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, falling short of the GAAP EPS consensus estimate by $0.27 and missing the revenue consensus estimate by $147.82 million. At the time of the report, management announced a $10 billion cost-reduction plan, including cutting 15,000 jobs and suspending dividend payments. This is likely to significantly improve its prospects in 2025, especially as the company exits its peak capital expenditure cycle. Nevertheless, amid these challenges, Qualcomm (QCOM) has suggested it may seek to buy segments of Intel. Currently, Intel is lagging behind its major competitors in data center and AI chips—AMD and NVIDIA (NVDA, Financial)—and is also failing to leapfrog TSMC in semiconductor manufacturing, which was its initial intention with its 18A advanced semiconductor manufacturing node. Now, TSMC has its market-leading 2nm N2 technology in the pipeline, with volume production expected in 2025. With all of this context in mind, it’s clear why Intel’s stock has been performing so poorly recently. However, there are positive developments that fortify the company’s position at its currently depressed valuation. For example, Apollo Global Management (APO) has proposed a $5 billion investment in Intel, signaling confidence in its turnaround strategy. Furthermore, this year’s challenges are likely temporary; my independent perspective is that 2025 will be a much stronger year for the company. While the 18A node may no longer be leapfrogging TSMC, it is expected to launch in 2025, helping Intel regain a competitive position in semiconductor manufacturing. The growth generated from 18A will be significantly supported by the company beginning to capitalize on its in-house manufacturing capabilities. Moreover, Intel’s IDM 2.0 initiative was implemented to enhance its foundry services. The company has heavily invested in fabs in the U.S., Europe, and Malaysia, including a $20 billion investment in two new fabs in Arizona. This is strengthening its global supply chain and increasing its manufacturing capacity. This explains why the company has had such a significant contraction in its free cash flow recently. While there have been challenges thus far in achieving a successful return on investment, as indicated in its second-quarter earnings report, I believe the company is still well-positioned based on a medium- to long-term horizon. Intel Free Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures Chart It’s worth reminding ourselves of management’s long-term strategy here, which reveals why the current depressed stock price could be a value opportunity. With an expansive internal foundry network, the company will have an increased capability to produce the majority of its products in-house. Furthermore, over time, it is likely to become a major provider of foundry services to external customers, including providing advanced process design kits for nodes like 18A. However, none of this changes that TSMC’s moat and market position are still unbeatable—the company currently holds over 60% of the market share in the global semiconductor foundry market. Its market share is therefore several times higher than that of its nearest competitor, Samsung Foundry, which has a market share of approximately 10 to 11%. Intel’s current position is negligible in comparison to these two players. Therefore, investors should not expect high alpha from Intel’s foundry services alone. Valuation and financial analysis Given the real constraints on Intel’s ability to produce lasting high growth in any of its major operating segments due to competition, I believe the value opportunity inherent in the low stock price is currently more appealing as a near-term allocation than a long-term one. The company has been particularly weak in profitability in the last few years, given the extensive operational investments it has been making to support its competitive positioning. Furthermore, its EV-to-revenue ratio has contracted less than its price-to-sales ratio over the past five years, suggesting that the company's net debt position has worsened relative to its market cap. That being said, there is enough total contraction on a revenue and book value basis to support a short-term investment. This is further supported by the fact that in 2025, I estimate the company’s year-over-year earnings growth could be over 300%, given its volume production plans with 18A, exit from its high-investment phase, and in-house manufacturing capabilities reducing costs. Intel Price Valuation Chart On a revenue basis—which I believe is more apt for this investment due to its recent instability in profitability—the company could achieve total revenues of $55.5 billion for full-year FY25, based on my analysis. If its P/S ratio expands to 2.75 over the next 12 months and the market prices these sales into the stock a couple of months early, the company could have a market cap of $152.6 billion. This indicates the potential for a market cap increase of 52% in a year from the current market cap of $100.31 billion. The company’s 10-year median P/S ratio is 2.94, and its 10-year revenue growth rate is 4.7%. Therefore, I believe an expansion to a P/S ratio of 2.75 is more than reasonable—even given the negative sentiment at the moment—considering my estimate of 6% revenue growth in FY25. This is further supported by the consensus that FY25 is likely to be a strong year for Intel on an earnings basis, as I mentioned above. While the market has a valid reason to be skeptical about Intel, I also find it highly unlikely that sentiment will not improve as the company's fundamental growth rates begin to expand. Looking longer term, and given the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry, I don’t think we can expect 6% revenue growth to last. Certainly, 300% or more normalized earnings growth will be a one-off occurrence for FY25. Revenue growth is likely to taper for Intel after a successful ramp-up of its 18A node and the increased demand related to AI at the moment. Moreover, FY25 is likely to be strong because Intel’s upcoming products, such as the Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest chips, are set to leverage the 18A process node, offering improved performance for AI and high-demand applications. In FY26, I expect we could see revenue growth of 5.5% or lower, and in 2027 and beyond, I believe the company will likely achieve a revenue growth rate of approximately 5%. Given that competition from TSMC is so strong, the notion that Intel will be able to maintain a 7% or 8% revenue growth rate over multiple years seems unlikely to me, especially considering the current operational challenges the company has faced in streamlining and efficiency, impacting its profitability. Profitability When looking more closely at Intel’s prospects of generating stable profits, there are certainly concerns currently that ought to be understood when making an allocation. The company’s net margin has declined from over 25% in 2021 to just 1.8% in the recent trailing 12 months. Moreover, this is higher than its operating margin of 0.92% right now, likely a result of tax credits from the CHIPS Act. While the company’s current financial position is concerning, management has prepared for a robust 2025, reinforcing my near-term value thesis. For example, the company plans to deliver over 100 million AI PCs by the end of 2025. The company’s internal foundry model is also expected to deliver savings of $8-10 billion by the end of 2025—this involves Intel’s internal product groups operating in a foundry-style relationship with its manufacturing group. That being said, its foundry business is not expected to generate substantial revenue until 2027, with some revenue anticipated in 2026. This means that its foundry model won't lead to significant growth in the near term, but it is likely to aid in lowering the cost of production for its in-house chips, supporting my near-term value thesis. Intel is targeting significant margin expansion by 2030 through its foundry model and operational improvements, so long-term investors may be rewarded by buying the stock at its current depressed valuation. Currently, Intel looks a little stronger when analyzing it based on EBITDA rather than net or operating income. It currently has $10.08 billion in depreciation and amortization, taking its trailing 12-month EBIT of $1.036 billion to $11.116 billion in EBITDA—that puts its current EBITDA margin at 20.17%. With lower capital expenditures on the horizon after its new fabrication facilities are complete, these should bring down its cost of goods sold, supporting its free cash flow, net income, and EBITDA. That said, I reiterate that there is significant execution risk in this thesis, and if management fails to effectively bring its foundry model to market, I expect further hardship and compounding losses could occur over the long term. Risk analysis Between 2021 and 2025, Intel planned to achieve five processor nodes—Intel 7 and Intel 4 are already in use, Intel 3 is ready for high-volume manufacturing, and Intel 20A is set to debut with Arrow Lake processors, serving as a precursor to the more refined 18A node. Therefore, management is broadly on track, but any challenges in 2025 for full-scale production of 18A could significantly reduce the likelihood of my value thesis being successful. Compounding recent setbacks, Intel recently announced delays in the construction of two major chip-making factories in Germany and Poland, pushing back their completion by approximately two years due to lower-than-expected demand and financial challenges. Additionally, with the $10 billion cost-saving plan outlined in my operational analysis and the reduction of 15,000 positions in its workforce, the financial strain could lead to lower revenues, even if future profitability becomes more secure. Given the rapid advancements in the semiconductor industry led in manufacturing by the highly organized TSMC, any operational setbacks could further exacerbate Intel’s lag behind the leading semiconductor players. This also applies to chip design compared to market leaders AMD and NVIDIA. In the near term, operational failures, lower demand, and technology inadequacies could lead to Intel being a value trap. In the long term, significantly lagging behind its competitors seems a very real and likely outcome. Therefore, these risks should be taken seriously, and allocations should not be outsized, given the potential for future growth inhibitions. Conclusion I’m confident Intel is currently a strong value opportunity, given that FY25 is likely to be a strong year for the company. With my estimate of 6% revenue growth from the full-year 2024 consensus total revenue and my prediction of a moderate expansion in its P/S ratio, the company’s market cap could increase by approximately 50% in a year. However, looking longer term, I believe the competitive pressures from TSMC in manufacturing and AMD and NVIDIA in design will continue to be problematic. Therefore, this value thesis may work better in the near term than over five to 10 years, depending on management’s strategic decisions and execution. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: This 8% Dividend Is The Perfect Buy As Markets Turn Choppy

Old man and the sea, in a rowboat or skiff paddling and fighting the waves of the ocean. I get it if you’re a bit wary of this latest market rally: We’ve got a volatile (to say the least!) election now days away. And while the Fed says rates are headed lower, there’s still a lingering uncertainty about where, exactly, they’ll land. While a bit of anxiety is understandable, we do not want to make the same mistake many “vanilla” investors do at times like these: go all into cash. For one, humans are terrible at predicting the future—remember those warnings of a 100% chance of a recession in 2023?—so safe to say a good number of today’s investment worries are unlikely to come to pass. Worse, for us dividend investors, going to cash carries an extra cost: We lose our income stream. And if you’re in closed-end funds (CEFs), you stand to lose a lot of income indeed: CEFs yield around 8% as I write this, and the portfolio of my CEF Insider service yields even more: around 9.4% as I write this. Just as a fast aside before we go further: One thing that bothers me about the discussion around CEFs these days is that people who don’t know much about them talk about them like they’re speculative investments. Nothing could be further from the truth: Fact is, CEFs are heavily regulated. Just like big companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Home Depot (HD) or Walmart (WMT), CEFs must account for their operations and file statements with the SEC every quarter. Even more reassuringly, most CEFs are managed by big financial institutions, which have a lot of investment resources at their disposal, as well as access to top portfolio-management talent and deep connections in the markets in which their funds operate. So instead of going to cash, we’re taking a pragmatic, dividend-focused (and CEF-focused) approach to the potential volatility ahead: We’re going to: The first thing that jumps out about ADX (besides the dividend yield) is its age: This one has been around since 1929, so it’s weathered the Great Depression, Second World War, soaring rates, falling rates, financial crises, a pandemic, you name it. (I’ve actually heard of some people who pass their holding in ADX down from generation to generation.) Adams has parlayed its long institutional experience into a stellar total return for ADX—nearly 3,500% since late 1988! This is where the fund’s value comes in, because as I write this, ADX trades at an 11.5% discount to NAV, letting us buy in below the value of its assets. (Or 11.5% less than where these stocks trade today, if you were to buy them “direct” yourself.) This discount is a holdover from a few months back, when the fund had a policy of paying most of its dividend as a year-end special payout that could be difficult to predict. Many CEF investors either didn’t understand the payout structure or were too impatient, so they left ADX aside. But management changed that policy and now will pay no less than 2% of NAV per quarter, for an average 8% yield on NAV. That should help ADX’s discount narrow, pulling its price up as it does. And either way, ADX’s policy really amounts to “translating” its portfolio gains into an income stream for you and me. Given the general direction of the market is up over the long term, it’s fair to expect our payouts to rise in the long run, too. Meantime, the fund’s portfolio is extremely modern. Its holdings have a strong tech bent, giving us a chance to buy rapid growers like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) at that 11.5% discount. ADX Portfolio Plus, as you can see, these top holdings also give us a smattering of non-tech names, like Visa (V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The 8% yield means that an investment of $500,000 in ADX would kick out roughly $40,000 of annual income, allowing you to live off dividends while reducing the need to draw down your principal. Here’s another fun fact: While the vast majority of that quadruple-digit return ADX has posted since 1988 was in dividend payouts that were then reinvested, the payout hasn’t hogged the entire spotlight: Shares traded for around $9.75 each back in 1988 and have more than doubled since: They’re around $22 now. So even if you took out all of those dividends and spent them to pay your bills, take vacations, invest elsewhere, whatever—you still saw your original buy double. Not bad!
