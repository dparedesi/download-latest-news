Title: Is DFAC ETF Still A Buy After 15% Run?

Investing DFAC returned 15% over the past year but matched the S&P 500 despite charging fees for factor-based tilts. Rising 10-year Treasury yields above 4.2% threaten DFAC’s small-cap holdings while 40% of Russell 2000 stocks remain unprofitable. The fund holds $40B with 16% in NVDA, MSFT and AAPL while maintaining a 0.17% expense ratio. Sending You to Google News in 3 © bigjom jom / Shutterstock.com The Dimensional U.S. Core Equity 2 ETF (NYSEARCA:DFAC) has delivered a 15% gain over the past year, essentially matching the S&P 500’s return. Investors paid for Dimensional’s factor-based approach and got market performance. DFAC’s 2026 performance will likely depend less on 2025 results and more on what drives 2026 returns. DFAC manages nearly $40 billion using a strategy that tilts toward smaller companies while maintaining mega-cap tech exposure. The fund’s top three holdings are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), representing nearly 16% of assets. Information technology accounts for 26% of the portfolio. This isn’t a pure small-cap fund-it’s a core equity strategy that leans into factor premiums when available but doesn’t abandon the market’s growth engines. Small-cap stocks live and die by interest rates, and 2026 presents a complicated picture. The Federal Reserve has delivered three rate cuts, bringing the federal funds rate to 3.5% to 3.75%. But longer-term Treasury yields have been climbing, with the 10-year hitting its highest level since September. That’s a problem for DFAC’s small-cap holdings. Small companies often rely on floating-rate debt, so they benefit when short-term rates fall. But rising long-term yields shrink the present value of future earnings, particularly for unprofitable companies. About 40% of Russell 2000 stocks didn’t turn a profit over the past year, according to Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO). DFAC’s factor screens help avoid the worst offenders, but the fund still holds plenty of smaller firms whose valuations depend on optimistic growth assumptions. Watch the 10-year Treasury yield weekly. If it continues climbing above 4.2%, the small-cap tilt that defines DFAC becomes a headwind. If yields stabilize or fall as the Fed continues easing, that same tilt becomes an advantage. The CME FedWatch Tool currently shows no rate cut priced in until April 2026 at the earliest. DFAC’s 33% concentration in its top 10 holdings is lower than most broad market funds, but those names still matter. The fund collected $0.39 in dividends per share in 2025, up 9% from 2024. That income comes primarily from large, profitable companies, not speculative small caps. The 0.17% expense ratio and 4% portfolio turnover mean DFAC isn’t churning through positions chasing momentum. Dimensional publishes quarterly fact sheets showing sector weights and top holdings. Check those documents to see whether the fund is increasing or decreasing small-cap exposure. If the team is adding to smaller names, they’re betting on rate cuts and economic resilience. If they’re pulling back, they see risks you should understand. The Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (NYSEARCA:AVUV) charges 0.25% and manages $17 billion with a more concentrated bet on small-cap value stocks. It doesn’t own NVDA or AAPL. If you believe small-cap value will outperform in 2026, AVUV delivers that thesis more directly than DFAC’s balanced approach. DFAC’s performance in 2026 will likely depend on whether interest rates stabilize and small-cap earnings catch up to large caps. The 10-year Treasury yield and quarterly fact sheets will show whether the fund’s positioning aligns with these market conditions. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Why Nvidia Could Have a Terrible Year in 2026, And Why It Might Not Be So Bad

Investing Nvidia faces deceleration risk if hyperscaler capex spending slows from recent elevated levels. Nearly all mega-cap tech companies are developing competing chips that threaten Nvidia’s market dominance. A Nvidia slowdown could benefit broader markets if AI cost declines drive efficiency gains elsewhere. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Among the top-performing (and most closely-watched) stocks in the market, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has to be on every investor’s radar. That’s mostly because this is the largest company in the world. As such, Nvidia’s price movements on a daily basis can swing the market in one direction or another – that’s how market cap-weighted indices work, after all. Thus, price predictions around where Nvidia will ultimately end up in 2026 are meaningful, and could have a significant impact on where investors think the overall market could be headed in the year to come. Let’s dive into a few of the challenges Nvidia could face in 2026, and take a more bearish perspective on this stock from a skeptical angle. I find such an exercise to be useful, even for investors such as myself who are generally bullish on the direction of this stock over the medium to long-term. Man fighting a bear on top of a red arrow heading lower I think the key risk facing Nvidia and its investor base this year is Capex-related growth which could be decelerating off of extremely high levels. Simply put, hyperscalers who have been investing heavily in the data center and AI buildout have been buying Nvidia chips to run their models one. With a fully integrated stack which includes key software that allows AI developers to utilize these chips to their maximum potential, Nvidia has created a world-class ecosystem which drives significant network effects that provide growing cash flows over time that are very difficult to replicate. The thing is, if the growth we’ve seen thus far in this buildout slows, and investors catch a whiff of a diminished backlog or some indication that future growth may not be as robust, this is a stock that could have significant downside from here. That’s mostly because investors can generally agree that NVDA stock is priced to perfection (or even a bit above perfection), with continuous earnings beats already priced into this name. If AI bubble chatter picks up, and some of Nvidia’s customers continue to turn into direct competitors (nearly all mega-cap tech companies are in the process of, or have already developed, their own chips), then Nvidia’s stranglehold on the high-performance chip market could deteriorate. If regulatory and labor bottlenecks further slow this AI buildout, then other key drivers could drive bearish momentum for this stock. In other words, things need to continue rolling as they have in recent years, and Nvidia will need to avoid these key potholes in the road ahead, to continue marching higher to the next $trillion thresholds along the way. Elderly couple looking at their portfolios in a surprised and positive way When I think about the headwinds Nvidia is facing right now, I also realize that these headwinds could have opposite and offsetting effects from other companies. If we do see a widespread Capex spending slowdown from the largest players in tech, then it’s entirely possible we could also see profits surge as existing AI technology creates added efficiencies and allows companies to earn more profits with less people. Of course, there’s a downside for the labor market if this takes place. But it’s also true that in the event that more Nvidia customers become direct competitors, that prices of AI technology and models could come down, which could be a net benefit both for consumers and for the entire AI ecosystem. In such an event, Nvidia’s potential decline could come at the benefit of many other companies and individuals (large and small), which could drive outsized economic growth. That’s the bullish take on how this bearish narrative could unravel. I think we need to see a broadening of the leadership Nvidia and other key tech giants have dominated in terms of market returns in recent history. Perhaps these well-choreographed headwinds will materialize, and it won’t be such a bad thing for investors or consumers over the long-term. We’ll see.

Title: Billionaire David Tepper Pours $411,000,000 Into Contrarian Asset After Dumping Exposure To Tech, Health and AI Stocks

A highly successful and closely watched billionaire is making major changes to his hedge fund’s portfolio. A new SEC filing shows the founder and president of Appaloosa Management, David Tepper, just sold UnitedHealth (UNH), Intel (INTC), Alibaba (BABA), Vistra (VST) and Micron (MU). Tepper slashed UNH by 92%, exited INTC entirely, trimmed BABA by 9%, cut VST by 31% and reduced MU by 39% in Q3 of 2025. Meanwhile, in a bold contrarian pivot, Tepper poured $411 million into Whirlpool (WHR), boosting shares from 266,000 to 5.5 million. The appliance giant now ranks third in Appaloosa’s $7.38 billion portfolio at 5.85%. Tepper also added stakes in old-economy names like Goodyear Tire (GT) and regional banks such as Truist (TFC) and Western Alliance (WAL). The moves reflect Tepper’s opportunistic style, betting on undervalued cyclicals amid tech pullbacks. The firm’s portfolio value grew 14% quarter-over-quarter, and its top holdings remain Alibaba (BABA) at 15.6%, Amazon (AMZN) at 7.4%, and Nvidia (NVDA) at 4.8%.

Title: Nvidia Is About to Deliver a Huge Late Christmas Gift to Investors
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2026/01/01/nvidia-is-about-to-deliver-a-huge-late-christmas-gift-to-investors/
Time Published: 2026-01-01T09:44:37Z
Full Content:
Investing Nvidia (NVDA) reportedly received orders exceeding 2 million H200 chips from Chinese tech companies for 2026 delivery. Current inventory stands at only 700,000 units. Nvidia asked Taiwan Semiconductor to ramp up H200 production starting in Q2 2026 to address the shortfall. H200 chips are priced at $27,000 per unit for China-specific variants. Shipments could help recover billions in lost Chinese sales from this year. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Although Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares jumped 38% over the course of 2025, reflecting strong early-year momentum driven by artificial intelligence (AI) demand, the second half of the year was something of a disappointment: The stock largely traded sideways as questions about slowing growth, supply constraints, competitive pressures, and valuation grew. It was the equivalent to investors waking up Christmas morning and finding Nvidia had given them a lump of coal in their stocking. However, as we prepare to turn the page into 2026, Nvidia may be about to deliver a belated gift to shareholders, one that promises a substantial stock price increase through expanded production and sales. It could be a real present for patient investors, one that brightens the prospects for the year ahead and beyond. According to an exclusive Reuters report, Nvidia has approached its manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), to dramatically increase the output of the H200 AI chips in response to surging demand from Chinese technology companies. Sources say that these firms have placed orders exceeding 2 million H200 units for delivery in 2026, but with Nvidia’s current inventory standing at approximately 700,000 chips, it created a significant shortfall that prompted the outreach to Taiwan Semiconductor. The H200 is based on Nvidia’s Hopper architecture and produced using Taiwan Semiconductor’s 4-nanometer process. As the second most powerful chip in its portfolio, one that is vastly superior for training complex models than the dumbed down versions Nvidia made to comply with U.S. export restrictions, it also indicates Chinese companies view it as a better option than other regional or locally produced chips. Nvidia has requested that Taiwan Semiconductor begin fabricating additional chips, with production slated to commence in the second quarter of 2026. While the precise volume of the new order remains undisclosed, this step aims to address the gap between Nvidia’s existing inventory and the incoming orders, giving the chipmaker time to ramp up to meet the demand. With the initial shipments fulfilled from its current stock, the first deliveries could potentially arrive before the Lunar New Year in mid-February 2026. This timeline builds on earlier reports the Trump administration authorized the shipment of H200 sales to China again. Pricing for the China-specific H200 variants has been set at around $27,000 per chip, according to the sources, positioning them as a viable option for Chinese buyers seeking high-performance AI hardware amid limited alternatives. This production ramp-up occurs as Nvidia shifts its attention toward its newer Blackwell series and the forthcoming Rubin chips, which are expected to drive future growth. The emphasis on H200 expansion, however, highlights China’s continued role as a major market, even as trade barriers have previously reduced Nvidia’s presence there. A Nvidia spokesperson stated that the company manages its supply chain on an ongoing basis. They added, “Licensed sales of the H200 to authorised customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States.” Yet the shipments could strain global AI chip availability, as Nvidia must allocate resources across regions while meeting heightened Chinese demand. Taiwan Semiconductor declined to comment on the matter, and China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to Reuters inquiries. Investors shouldn’t get too hopeful just yet. The Reuters report relies on anonymous sources and lacks official confirmation from Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, or Chinese regulators, and Beijing has not approved any H200 imports. However, if the report proves true, this could help Nvidia regain traction in China, countering the billions of dollars in lost sales it recorded this year, and the $5.5 billion writedown on its chip inventory it took. Renewed chip sales to China could also be the first step in regaining its lost market share, while delivering a late Christmas gift to investors. Our top personal finance-related articles today.
