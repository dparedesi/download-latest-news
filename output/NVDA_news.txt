The chipmaker said Monday it had signed a letter of intent with OpenAI to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia-powered AI systems. A gigawatt is equal to one billion watts of power‚Äîenough electricity to supply millions of homes. We're proud to announce a landmark partnership with @OpenAI to build new gigascale AI factories using millions of NVIDIA GPUs. ü§ù This partnership will supply 10 gigawatts of GPUs to fuel @OpenAI's data center growth. pic.twitter.com/CYEB2PdfWY ‚Äî NVIDIA (@nvidia) September 22, 2025 According to a report by Bloomberg, the money will be provided in stages, with the first $10 billion coming when the deal is signed, citing people familiar with the matter. Nvidia will receive OpenAI equity as part of the deal. Nvidia‚Äôs stock (NVDA) rose 4% from $177.50 to $184.16 on news of the partnership. In an interview with CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the deal the next leap forward for artificial intelligence. ‚ÄúThe computing demand is going through the roof,‚Äù Jensen said. ‚ÄúThis partnership is about building an AI infrastructure that enables AI to go from the labs into the world. This is about the AI industrial revolution arriving.‚Äù The plan calls for vast new data centers filled with millions of GPUs, including its upcoming Vera Rubin platform, designed for training and running next-generation models. The first gigawatt of capacity is expected to go online in the second half of 2026, with the rest rolling out as Nvidia ramps its investment. Joining Huang were OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and OpenAI President Greg Brockman. Altman said the deal with Nvidia will expand the ambitions set by the Stargate project announced by President Donald Trump in January. ‚ÄúThis is the fuel we need to drive improvement‚Äîto build better models, generate revenue, everything,‚Äù Altman said. ‚ÄúThis is helping us, along with our partners at Stargate, Microsoft, and Oracle, to build increasing amounts of infrastructure to deliver on what the world is demanding.‚Äù Deploying 10 gigawatts of computing capacity won‚Äôt be simple, however. Cooling alone can consume nearly 40% of a data center‚Äôs power use, according to energy consultancy 174 Power Global. Environmental concerns are also mounting. Deloitte estimates data centers will account for about 2% of global electricity use in 2025, or 536 terawatt-hours, but says demand from power-hungry AI could push that figure to more than 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2030. The United Nations Environment Programme has warned of rising water consumption for cooling, while the Environmental and Energy Study Institute said data centers are already straining electric grids.

Major U.S. equities indexes climbed Monday afternoon, boosted by the tech sector as Nvidia (NVDA) announced a $100 billion investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia led gains on the Dow, and was among the day's best-performing stocks on the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Shares of several Nvidia partners such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Micron Technology (MU) also rose. Teradyne (TER) shares jumped as Susquehanna raised the price target of the semiconductor equipment maker to $200 from $133, pointing to growth in demand expected next year and beyond. Shares of other companies that make equipment used to manufacture chips, including Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML (ASML), and Lam Research (LRCX), climbed as well. Apple (AAPL) shares surged as Wedbush lifted its price target for the tech giant's stock to a new Street high of $310 from $270 on signs of better-than-expected demand for the iPhone 17. Metsera (MTSR) shares soared after Pfizer (PFE) said it would buy the biopharma firm for up to $7.3 billion as it looks to profit from soaring demand for weight-loss medicines. Pfizer shares rose as well. Shares of real estate brokerage Anywhere Real Estate (HOUS), which owns Century 21, Coldwell Banker, and others, took off after rival Compass (COMP) announced it was acquiring Anywhere. Compass shares slid. Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) saw its shares slump following reports the White House is expected to make an announcement linking pregnant women‚Äôs use of the painkiller to autism. Coinbase Global (COIN) shares lost ground as prices for most major cryptocurrencies fell. Gold futures climbed to record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen.

Nvidia and OpenAI's business relationship is entering a new phase. The chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom and world's most valuable company said Monday it plans to invest up to $100 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia (NVDA) shares gained close to 4% following the news, making the stock one of the best performers in the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 Monday afternoon. Several Nvidia partners, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Micron Technology (MU), saw their shares rise along with companies that make equipment to manufacture chips, boosting the tech sector. "This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward‚Äîdeploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release. Nvidia said the first of those 10 gigawatts is expected to be deployed in the second half of next year, on its next-generation Vera Rubin platform. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said it will use what it's building with Nvidia to "create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale."

Title: Fed Easing Cycle Resumes: Market Implications

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the Federal Reserve rate cut last Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high last Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the market. As outlined previously, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point cut at its September 17 meeting. The statement from the committee said, ‚Äúdownside risks to employment have risen,‚Äù which indicates that the recent softness in the monthly jobs reports has shifted the Fed back into easing mode after a nine-month hiatus. The median projections from the Fed call for 25-basis point cuts in October and December. Previously, the Fed only expected a cut at one of those meetings. Markets have also priced in at the October and December Fed meetings. Notably, the Fed‚Äôs increase in the number of median rate cuts was by a very narrow margin, so these cuts are far from a sure thing with incoming data remaining crucial. Both two-year and ten-year Treasury yields are well below their highs for the year. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Recession odds declined following the Fed rate cut announcement, and stocks reached a new all-time closing high. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. The lessening of the odds of recession benefited the more economically sensitive stocks. Beyond this relationship, smaller capitalization stocks, using the Russell 2000 as an example, have outperformed recently. Furthermore, bank stocks have continued to outperform, benefiting from a better economic outlook and a steeper yield curve. The most direct beneficiaries of the rate cut are companies (and households) with floating-rate debt. Another transmission mechanism for lower short-term rates to positively impact the economy is the housing sector. As housing affordability hovers near all-time lows since 1989, part of the equation has been due to higher mortgage rates. This lack of affordability is most pronounced for first-time homebuyers. The expectation of a decline in short-term rates has led to the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropping from a high of 7.41% in January to 6.37% most recently. The US housing market has been limping along with a depressed level of new single-family home building. Permits for new single-family home construction show a similar poor outlook for home building. While mortgage applications for home purchases remain depressed, the trend has been moving higher since mortgage rates peaked. Notably, mortgage applications for refinancing have spiked with the lower mortgage rates. Importantly, this puts extra cash in the pockets of US households. Unfortunately, this refinancing cycle is likely to be less potent than previous cycles due to the significant amount of refinancing that occurred when rates were at ultra-low levels during the pandemic. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with Costco (COST) and Micron Technology (MU) being the most notable for their economic insights. There are a whopping eighteen speeches from Federal Reserve members scheduled for this week. This Fedspeak will be closely watched for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts, none more so than Fed Chair Powell‚Äôs speech on Tuesday. Stocks continue to price in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of small companies, banks, and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. The Fed‚Äôs cut last week, along with the expectation of two more cuts this year, reinforced the notion that the soft spot in the labor market will not develop into a full-fledged downturn. The positive boost from easing monetary policy is lagged and variable, so it will be imperative to monitor the impact to ascertain if it is consistent with market expectations. There is little doubt that lower rates will have less potency than in previous cycles and may come at a more significant lag, given the legacy of ultra-low interest rates during the pandemic.

Title: Stock Buybacks Have Slowed. Here's Why It Matters That They Could Bounce Back.

A slump in stock buybacks could be in the rearview mirror. What that means for stocks is more complicated. S&P 500 buybacks in the second quarter fell 20% from record highs in the first quarter, but they are expected tick up in the current one. With economic policy uncertainty starting to dissipate and interest rates headed lower, repurchase activity from companies in the broad market index is expected to return to record levels, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Wall Street analysts, however, say buybacks may not be as helpful to EPS growth as they once were. Headline buyback figures are big, but their growth has stalled lately even for the biggest companies in the index. Companies like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA), which usually account for about 30% of annual buyback spending, posted no meaningful year-over-year growth in the second quarter, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report. A lack of buyback activity has resulted in a lower buyback yield‚Äîwhich measures total buybacks over a given period divided by market cap at the start of that period‚Äîfor the the S&P 500 over the past 12 months. The figure recently touched 2%, the lowest level in 20 years, excluding recessions. (That is, however, partly due to big spending on artificial intelligence that has contributed to a decline in share repurchases.) Share prices have risen faster than earnings have, and payout ratios have fallen, leading to higher price-to-earnings multiples and lower buyback yields. A falling buyback yield means less of a boost to earnings per share: Buybacks result in lower shares outstanding, and buybacks from 2005 to 2019 boosted EPS growth by a median of 1.2 percentage points annually, according to Goldman. That tailwind has fallen off lately. The decline in the S&P's buyback yield is expected to level off as share repurchasing activity returns, per Goldman. The firm estimates share repurchases to total $1 trillion this year, 5% higher than in 2024. But in the meantime, companies that have sustained buyback activity‚Äîso-called buyback aristocrats, or companies that consistently repurchase their shares‚Äîcould benefit from a rising scarcity premium, Goldman analysts including Ben Snider wrote. The median buyback aristocrat tends to have larger market-caps, higher buyback yields, lower valuations relative to the broader index, and generated a higher year-to-date return. The list of aristocrats includes Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Applied Materials (AMAT), eBay (EBAY), Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX), according to Goldman.
