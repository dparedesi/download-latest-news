ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Near the end of 2022, a reader wrote in to tell me that my bullish view of the economy at the time was off the mark. From his vantage point, people were struggling, prices were soaring, and wages weren’t keeping up. This reader wasn’t alone—it was around that time that Bloomberg wrote that the chances of a recession in the next year were 100%. So there was zero chance of avoiding one, in other words. We all know what happened next: The economy and stock market took off. That translated into real gains (and high income) for the portfolio of my CEF Insider service. In our equity bucket, for example, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a long-time holding (more than eight years) posted a total return that topped the S&P 500 from the end of 2022 to the time of this writing. Today, we see a very similar situation, with pessimism running high. The difference now is that stocks are hitting all-time highs, causing a lot of investors (maybe you among them) to ponder selling ahead of a coming downturn. We contrarians, of course, know that when the crowd fears something will happen, something else usually does. Which is why ADX remains a buy, even though (and indeed because) the closed-end fund (CEF) holds high-flying tech stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon.com (AMZN), plus strong blue chips in other sectors, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Here’s why I’m so bullish on stocks—and CEFs—like these. A Strong—Yet Hated—Economy First, we need to say upfront that large companies are seeing surging revenue, with 6.2% year-over-year gains, according to the Financial Times. These gains come from across sectors—with one exception: Energy. That’s understandable, and it’s actually good for US consumers and companies except for, well, Big Oil. Moreover, every sector but consumer discretionary is posting accelerating sales—that is, this year’s gains are bigger than last year’s. That’s the first part of the reason why I’m bullish on funds like ADX. But consider also broader retail spending, excluding cars and gas. It’s a key measure, since people buy cars in long cycles and gas is volatile, so both can skew the numbers. Here we see strong demand for goods and services—another plus for the economy. The outlook is positive, too, with the Federal Reserve’s GDPNow indicator, the most up-to-the-minute metric we have, showing growth above 3%, way above beyond Wall Street economists’ estimates. Why are economists—and indeed most investors—feeling dour, then? Let’s take a closer look at this, starting with what might seem like a pretty weird indicator at first. This chart shows wage growth for workers who are neither managers nor business owners over the past 30 years (the dotted line). It stacks that up against the increase of the cost dining out (the solid line). Like I said, a weird one! But stick with me because it shows these workers’ average earnings have risen more than the cost dining out. The takeaway: Average Americans have more money to eat out, and that’s actually a reasonably good barometer of middle-class wealth gains. But there are drawbacks to this chart, mainly that it doesn’t show things like costs for education, healthcare and other basics. All of these are becoming heavier burdens for the lower middle class. And since these people are a big part of the economy, this makes things look tougher for many Americans. Indeed, they are tougher. We can make of that what each of us will, of course, but we always endeavor to stay out of politics here at Contrarian Outlook—and focus solely on what the data is telling us. And that is this: The US economy is growing strongly, even though the lower middle class is struggling. It follows, then, that the rich are driving more corporate sales. This is bad for social welfare, sure, but from an economic perspective, it just means the kinds of things being sold are changing and the number of people buying them is shrinking. Bloomberg has some good data on this, showing that the top 10% of income earners now account for nearly 50% of total consumer spending—a record high. Now, we might worry that if the number of people driving revenue growth keeps shrinking, a pullback would result. And I agree. But wealthy Americans’ share of consumer spending also skyrocketed in the late 1990s, and I know I don’t have to tell you what stocks have done since then. So, no matter where each of us stand on the rich being a bigger part of the economy, this isn’t necessarily bad for business. In fact, in many cases, it can be good for business. But it absolutely can result in higher pessimism overall. And pessimism, as we contrarians know, provides buying opportunities. Which brings me back to ADX, which, despite the S&P 500 levitating higher, has seen its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) widen in the last three months. Today, we have a chance to buy this smartly run CEF for 9% off. That’s partly a hangover from a change ADX made to its distribution in 2024. Under its old scheme, the fund paid minuscule regular dividends and made up for those with a huge end-of-year special payout that varied depending on its NAV performance. Now, ADX targets an 8% annualized payout (based on NAV), paid four times a year. So if NAV rises, so does the payout. That’s much more investor-friendly, and it’s caused ADX’s discount to narrow slightly in the last year or so, but not as much as it should. That’s our chance to buy, as ADX is positioned to benefit from themes like the spread of AI and the resulting build-out of data centers. And we can get in at that 9% discount—thanks again to investor pessimism and misunderstanding. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Reports that a group of investors could be gearing up for a takeover bid helped drive a power-up for a major video game publisher, while soft same-store sales results in the U.S. weighed on the stock of a membership warehouse club. Major U.S. equities indexes broke their three-day losing streak as a key inflation gauge was in line with expectations, which could keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates further. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6%, the Dow was up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq ended 0.4% higher. Click here to find more coverage from Investopedia of the day's market news. Shares of video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) surged nearly 15%, logging the top performance in the S&P 500, after a report that a deal could be in the works to take the company private. According to The Wall Street Journal, a group of investors that includes Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and the private equity firm Silver Lake could be nearing a $50 billion transaction—potentially the largest leveraged buyout of all time—to take over the game publisher known for its sports titles. President Donald Trump announced a new set of tariffs Thursday, including levies on imports of pharmaceuticals, certain types of furniture, and heavy-duty trucks. Shares of Paccar (PCAR), parent company of the Peterbilt and Kenworth truck brands, gaining over 5%. The company had previously indicated that tariff-related uncertainty was weighing on the truck market, with U.S. truck manufacturers also managing the impact of tariffs on key components like steel and aluminum. Intel (INTC) shares extended their recent rally, adding 4.4% Friday. The Wall Street Journal indicated that, in addition to talks with Apple (AAPL), Intel has approached TSMC (TSM) about potential investment and partnership opportunities. Nvidia (NVDA), the world's largest company by market capitalization, announced a $5 billion investment and collaboration plan with Intel last week. Boeing (BA) shares climbed 3.6% after the Federal Aviation Administration said the plane maker will be allowed to issue airworthiness certificates on some of its 737 Max and 787 jets. The eased restrictions, which enable the company to conduct the final safety check on certain aircraft, could help Boeing accelerate production and delivery schedules. In addition, Turkish Airlines finalized a deal to purchase 225 Boeing planes following Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's visit to the U.S. this week. Costco (COST) stock slid nearly 3% after the members-only warehouse giant reported its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results. Sales and profits topped analysts' expectations, but U.S. same-store sales fell slightly short of estimates. While shoppers may be drawn to Costco's bargains on essential items amid economic uncertainty and concerns about inflation, the company said consumers remain cautious about discretionary purchases and pointed to intensifying competition in the space. Oracle (ORCL) shares fell 2.7% Friday, extending declines posted in the prior session after Rothschild Redburn initiated coverage of the stock with a "sell" rating. Analysts cautioned that markets may be overly optimistic in their lofty expectations for the software provider's cloud operations. Shares of online auction platform operator eBay (EBAY) slipped about 2%. The stock had notched strong gains after the e-commerce company posted better-than-expected revenue, adjusted earnings, and gross merchandise volume in its latest earnings report released at the end of July. EBay said this week that it agreed to purchase Norway-based consumer-to-consumer social marketplace Tise.

Title: Key Indicators to Watch in Q4: Bitcoin Seasonal Trends, XRP/BTC, Dollar Index, Nvidia, and More

This is an analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. As we approach the final quarter of 2025, the following key charts provide valuable insights to help crypto traders navigate the evolving market landscape. Seasonal trends suggest a bullish Q4 outlook for both BTC$111,834.55 and ETH$4,122.33, the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Since 2013, BTC$111,834.55 has delivered an average return of 85% in the final quarter, according to data from Coinglass, making Q4 historically the strongest period for bulls. November stands out as the most bullish month, with an average gain of 46%, followed by October, which typically sees a 21% increase. ETH$4,122.33 also tends to perform well in the last three months of the year, although its strongest historical returns have been in the first quarter since inception. Bitcoin's price has dropped by 5% this week, consistent with the bearish technical signals and looks set to extend losses to late August lows near $107,300. If bulls fail to defend that, the focus will shift to the 200-day simple moving average at $104,200. The ongoing price decline, combined with bitcoin's historical pattern of peaking approximately 16 to 18 months after a halving event, may scare bulls. However, such concerns may be premature as long as prices remain above the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This moving average has consistently acted as a support level, marking the end of corrective price pullbacks during the current bull run that began in early 2023. Traders, therefore, should closely watch the 50-week SMA, which is currently positioned around $98,900, as a key level for broader market direction. XRP, often called the "U.S. government coin" by firms like Arca, has surged 32% this year. However, despite this strong rally, the payments-focused cryptocurrency remains confined within a prolonged sideways trading range against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC), showing limited relative strength. The XRP/BTC pair has been confined within a narrow trading range since early 2021, resulting in over four years of low-volatility compression. Recent price action near the upper boundary of this channel suggests that bulls are gradually gaining control. A breakout from such a prolonged consolidation could trigger a powerful rally in XRP relative to BTC, as the accumulated energy from this squeeze is released. Now, let’s turn to charts that call for caution. The leveraged anti-Strategy ETF (SMST), which seeks to deliver daily investment results that are -200%, or minus 2x, the daily percentage change in bitcoin-holder Strategy's (MSTR) share price, is flashing bullish signals. The ETF’s price climbed to a five-month high of $35.65, forming what appears to be an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, characterized by a prominent trough (the head) flanked by two smaller, roughly equal troughs (the shoulders). This pattern often signals a potential bullish reversal, suggesting the ETF may be gearing up for a significant upward move. In other words, it's flashing a bearish signal for both BTC and Strategy, which is the largest publicly listed BTC holder with a coin stash of 639,835 BTC. Last week, I discussed the dollar's post-Fed rate cut resilience as a potential headwind for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The dollar index has since gained ground, establishing a double bottom at around 96.30. It's a sign that bulls have successfully established the path of least resistance on the higher side. A continued move beyond 100.26, the high of the interim recovery between the twin bottoms around 96.30, would confirm the so-called double bottom breakout, opening the door for a move to 104.00. Watch out for the pattern failure below 96.00, as that could lead to increased risk-taking in financial markets. Nvidia (NVDA), the world's largest listed company by market value, and a bellwether for risk assets, continues to flirt with the upper end of the broadening channel identified by June 2024 and November 2024 highs and lows hit in August 2024 and April 2025. The rally has stalled at the upper trendline since late July in a sign of bullish exhaustion. Should it decline from here, it could signal the onset of a risk-off period in global markets, including cryptocurrencies.

Stock futures are lower after two straight days of declines for major indexes as investors await key economic data; Costco Wholesale (COST) is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell; Intel (INTC) shares are rising on a report it is seeking an investment from Apple (AAPL); and Starbucks (SBUX) is laying off workers and closing stores as it continues to restructure. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing a lower open for major indexes after two days of declines as investors prepare for the release of key economic data reports to finish off the week. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were recently down 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 0.2%. Gold futures edged higher to $3,785 an ounce to stay near record highs, while bitcoin (BTCUSD) was at $111,500, little changed from yesterday afternoon. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects mortgage rates and a variety of other consumer borrowing costs, edged higher to 4.16%. Costco Wholesale (COST) will release its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the closing bell today, with some analysts expecting volatility in the stock. The update comes after some investors were shaken in the spring by signs that sales growth had decelerated. The company has already reported that fourth-quarter sales rose 8% compared with the year-ago quarter. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expect the retailer to report that profits grew to $2.6 million in the fourth-quarter, up from $2.4 million a year ago. Costco shares, which have gained 3% since the start of the year, were slightly higher in premarket trading. Data on economic growth, jobless claims and housing sales are in focus this morning ahead of a highly anticipated inflation report that's set to be released Friday. The jobless claims numbers, which are expected to show a slight increase, are being closely watched by investors after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week amid signs that the labor market is weakening. Revisions to second-quarter gross domestic product are expected to show that growth held steady at 3.3%, while existing home sales are estimated to have declined slightly. Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak today, ahead of the release tomorrow morning of the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. Shares of Intel (INTC) continued gaining ground this morning following a report the chipmaker is seeking an investment from Apple (AAPL). Intel shares rose more than 6% on Wednesday after Bloomberg News reported on talks between the companies, which also centered on other ways that Apple could help the beleaguered chipmaker. The report comes after Nvidia (NVDA) last week agreed to invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a deal that will see the two companies co-develop chips for data centers and PCs. Intel shares were up nearly 2% in recent premarket trading. The stock has gained more than 50% year-to-date, but remain well off its historical highs. Apple shares were little changed ahead of the bell. Starbucks (SBUX) is laying off around 900 employees in its corporate offices and closing some stores as CEO Brian Niccol continues to implement his “Back to Starbucks” turnaround plan. Niccol said in an update Thursday that the total number of stores was expected to decline by about 1% in 2025 after the closures. He said that laid-off employees in corporate offices would receive severance packages, while employees at closed stores could also receive severance if they are not transferred to other nearby stores. The moves come as analysts have praised the coffee chain’s efforts to revive sales amid sluggish customer traffic. Starbucks shares were flat in premarket trading.

Title: Could Intel's Next Big Investment Come From Apple?

Intel has reportedly set its sights on a deal with Apple, a move that could further boost the struggling chipmaker. Shares of Intel (INTC) surged over 6% Wednesday following a Bloomberg report that it's solicited support from the iPhone maker. Neither company responded to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication. Shares of Apple fell less than 1%. Wall Street analysts broadly believe Intel likely needs more funds and foundry commitments from customers to succeed with its turnaround plan. Investments from Nvidia and the U.S. government have helped that process along, and one from Apple would mark another step. The stock has clambered higher this year, but it's well off past highs, a reminder that there's plenty of work yet to do. With Wednesday's gains, Intel's stock has added a quarter of its value in the week since Intel announced a $5 billion investment from and chip-development partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). The raft of events have excited investors, with the Nvidia news seen as a vote of confidence from the world's most valuable company. Still, the stock remains well off its highs, with most Wall Street analysts tracked by Visible Alpha sticking by "hold" ratings while waiting for evidence of more business for Intel's foundry, which makes chips for other firms and which is central to maintaining support from the U.S. government—itself now a major shareholder. A deal with Apple could help Intel's case, particularly if it came with foundry commitments. Nvidia's did not, raising speculation about whether a foundry deal could come later or whether the lack of one underscored Intel's challenges in convincing customers. "If Intel can prove they can deliver they will have customers lined up around the block," Bernstein analysts wrote last week. "If they can’t, no customer in their right mind will put any meaningful volume there." New partners might also see a deal with Intel as a way to gain political goodwill, Bernstein said. That may hold some appeal to former Intel customer Apple, which has shown some signs of inroads with the Trump administration, last month winning pledges of tariff exemptions based on its recent investments in U.S. manufacturing.

Reduced forecasts for copper and gold sales weighed on a big mining stock, while shares of a semiconductor giant made another push higher after an industry peer offered a bright outlook. Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground for a second consecutive session Wednesday, reflecting pressure on the tech sector and despite outperformance from energy names. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost around 0.3%, while the Dow ended 0.4% lower. Read here for Investopedia's comprehensive market coverage. Intel (INTC) stock jumped 6.4%, lifted by an afternoon report from Bloomberg that the company had discussed Apple (AAPL) buying a stake. The latest move higher for shares of the chipmaking giant also came after Micron Technology (MU) raised it outlook for PCs and traditional servers, two of Intel's key markets. Intel stock has gained more than 25% over the past month amid a string of high-profile investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank (SFTBY), and Nvidia (NVDA). Micron's stock fell nearly 3%, while Apple's was off less than 1%. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) shares tumbled 17%, more than any other stock in the S&P 500 on, after the mining giant lowered its forecasts for quarterly copper and gold sales. Issues at Freeport's Indonesia unit weighed on its outlook; .the company declared force majeure at its Grasberg mine after a mud flow partially blocked access to the underground facility, resulting in fatal injuries to two workers. Shares of Axon Enterprise (AXON) fell 10% after the provider of less-lethal weapons and other law enforcement technology announced the acquisition of Prepared, an emergency communications platform powered by artificial intelligence. Needham analysts reiterated their "buy" rating on Axon stock but noted the complexities involved in a potential return to the computer-aided dispatch market. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Axon stock with a bullish "overweight" rating. Xcel Energy (XEL) said it agreed to settle litigation related to the devastating 2021 Marshall Fire in Colorado. Although the electric utility reaffirmed its belief that its equipment did not cause the fire, it will pay roughly $640 million to settle lawsuits involving more than 4,000 plaintiffs who sued for damages. Xcel Energy shares rose 6.7%, logging the benchmark index's top performance in the midweek trading session. Shares of health insurer Centene (CNC) gained 5.8%. Centene's managed health subsidiary Meridian Health of Illinois said it paid providers $15 million in value-based care incentives for improving health outcomes for its Medicaid members. Reductions in emergency room visits and inpatient readmissions under this initiative bode well for Centene's goal of reining in medical costs. Makers of agricultural chemicals received a boost following reports that a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is pushing for a resolution that could stabilize fertilizer markets. More than 60 members of Congress reportedly signed a letter requesting that Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum add phosphate to the U.S. Critical Minerals List, a move that could help bolster domestic production of key crop nutrients. Shares of Mosaic (MOS) and CF Industries Holdings (CF) were up 5.8% and 5.2%, respectively.

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Nvidia's $100B investment in OpenAI, linked to $350B in chip sales, raises circular financing concerns, drawing parallels to Cisco's risky dot-com era vendor lending.OpenAI's $1 trillion data center ambition heavily relies on Nvidia's investment, securing vital chip supplies for AI growth, though potentially at lower margins for Nvidia.The AI hardware sector, led by Nvidia, is experiencing a significant boom, with its segment of the Generative AI Stock Index surging 403%, driving overall market growth. Nvidia shares are up 29% this year and 1,124% since the beginning of 2023. The company’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI raised questions about whether that rally would continue, according to the New York Times. The most fundamental question is this: Is Nvidia using its own money – investments in Open AI, CoreWeave and others – to fuel growing demand for the company’s graphics processing units? This brings back memories of the dot-com boom when Cisco Systems provided financing to startups to fuel growth in demand for the company’s networking equipment. Through its Cisco Capital arm, the company lent billions to money-losing telecom firms to buy Cisco’s products. In the late 1990s, Cisco regularly reported 40% to 60% revenue growth and by 2000, 10% of the company’s $20 billion in revenue was attributable to such financing and leasing deals. When the dot-bubble burst in 2001, Cisco set aside $900 million in reserves for bad loans to those customers, reported the Los Angeles Times, and tightened its lending standards. To be sure, if Nvidia's investments do not pay off, the GPU designer will not need to write off bad loans as Cisco did – but it could mark down the value of those investments on its balance sheet. In the meantime, all of these investments make Nvidia and Open AI the lead companies in a V-shaped forward migration of AI technology providers. Other segments of the industry – including chip makers and their suppliers, data center technology and energy providers, database companies, and many others, noted my book Brain Rush – are benefiting from this ongoing boom as evidenced by the 157% rise in my Generative AI Stock Index (compared to a 116% rise in the Nasdaq). OpenAI is planning to build $1 trillion worth of data centers – $300 billion worth will be supplied with help from Oracle and another $100 billion from the Nvidia deal, reported the Wall Street Journal. "Everything starts with compute," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. "Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale." If OpenAI – which last fall said it expected to lose $44 billion through 2029, noted the Journal – can find the cash to finance these data centers, the industry will keep expanding. That may keep shares of Nvidia, Oracle, and many other participants in the AI ecosystem rising. If not, look out below. An Nvidia spokesperson declined my request to comment. Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI in $10 billion chunks. For every gigawatt of Nvidia-supported data centers OpenAI builds, Nvidia will invest $10 billion. For every $10 billion Nvidia invests, OpenAI will spend $35 billion on Nvidia chips, according to New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu whose work was featured in The Economist. OpenAI will pay for the chips through a blend of 71% in cash and 29% stock, noted NewStreet Research. One worrisome aspect of this deal is its lower margins for Nvidia. “That arrangement reduces Nvidia’s typical margins for cutting-edge chips,” wrote the Journal, while the chip designer will benefit from ensuring steady GPU demand. This deal also lowers OpenAI’s cost of capital due to Nvidia’s relatively sterling credit rating. Prior to this deal, OpenAI bought thousands of Nvidia’s chips through cloud service providers and neo-clouds – which buy chips and develop data center clusters – “renting them out at a premium,” the Journal reported. These data center builders borrow money to finance their operations. Data center deals associated with money-losing companies such as OpenAI were financed at interest rates as high as 15%; whereas the interest rates for deals backed by Microsoft ranged from 6% to 9%, the Journal wrote. Nvidia – which generated $72 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters – seems to have ample interest free funds for financing its Open AI deal. It remains to be seen whether the chip designer will fund all $100 billion of its OpenAI commitment. Mark Twain reportedly said history does not repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes. Will Nvidia’s huge bets on money-losing companies such as OpenAI rhyme with Cisco’s aggressive lending to unprofitable telecom service providers? It is too early to tell. However, Cisco’s lending during the dot-com boom “highlights the lengths to which one of the darlings of Wall Street would go to keep reporting revenue increases,” noted the Los Angeles Times. For Cisco, a key question was whether the company booked revenue for these financing deals too soon. In some of the company’s deals, such as those of American Metrocomm and Digital Broadband Communications, Cisco recorded sales only when the customers began repaying the loans, the Los Angeles Times wrote. In other cases, such as Rhythms NetConnections – an Englewood, Colo. based Internet access provider owned by a then-major Cisco shareholder Bill Stensrud – “Cisco booked sales at the outset -- even before a penny had been collected and even when the customers were teetering toward a bankruptcy filing,” reported the Los Angeles Times. Rhythms was unprofitable – reporting a loss of $36 million on $1 million in 1998 sales. But Cisco shipped $20 million of its equipment to Rhythms prior to the company’s April 1999 IPO. By August 2001, Rhythms had filed for bankruptcy leaving $30 million in unpaid debt to Cisco, according to the Los Angeles Times. By 2003, Cisco was chastened. “Cisco recognized that there were risks involved” in its earlier strategy, the company said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times, “but the decision to proceed was made for sound business reasons and based on analysis of the facts that existed at the time.” An economist who studied the telecom industry and reviewed documents about Cisco’s lending practices reached a sobering conclusion. By making loans to so many distressed companies, “these guys were operating under a fallacy,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jerry Hausman told the Los Angeles Times. For a company to increase sales this way, he added, it’s like “you’re pumping yourself up on steroids,” Hausman added. The takeaway? Investors should keep a close watch on how much of Nvidia’s revenue is coming from customers in which the chip designer has invested. Moreover, it’s worth investigating the accounting policies for recognizing revenue from such deals and quantifying their value on Nvidia’s balance sheet. When Nvidia announced its investment in OpenAI, shares in other technology providers rose as well. Other stocks – notably Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, memory supplier SK Hynix, STMicro, Infineon and BE Semiconductor – gained ground, reported CNBC. My Generative AI Stock Index, about which I wrote in a June 2014 Forbes post, aims to capture the stock market performance of companies in the following industry segments: Overall, the GAISI has risen 157% between the beginning of January 2023 – the month ChatGPT reached 100 million subscribers – and September 24, 2025. Here is the average return for the four segments of the industry value network during that period: The top performing industry segment was generative AI hardware – of which Nvidia (+1,124%) and liquid cooling provider Vertiv (1,012%) – were the leading stocks. The worst performing sector was AI consulting – of which Gartner dropped most – down 23%. Analysts gave mixed opinions about Nvidia’s investment. The good news is the investment assures things get built; the bad news is 'circularity’ – which I interpret to mean Nvidia is buying its own products through a third-party. “On the one hand this helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Reuters. “On the other hand the 'circular’ concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further,” Rasgon added. Several analysts see the deal adding between $400 billion and $500 billion to Nvidia’s revenue. For example, “We estimate this deal ultimately translates into ~$400B of NVDA revenue over a multi-year period,” UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note Monday, reported Barron’s. Another analyst shares Rasgon’s concerns about circularity and sees both Nvidia and OpenAI being better off. “So Nvidia has the demand for the chips, but are also investing, hoping that OpenAI itself becomes a good investment,” Creative Strategies CEO Ben Bajarin told the Times. Circularity has led to problems in prior tech booms. If OpenAI can keep convincing investors to provide more capital, Nvidia has a chance of reporting better-than-expected results. Otherwise, AI could become a bubble that bursts.
