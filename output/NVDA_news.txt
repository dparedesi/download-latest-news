For around a decade, the U.S. has retained its A.I. dominance over China, according to Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old founder and CEO of Scale AI, a $13 billion startup. But with the Christmas release of an “earth-shattering” A.I. model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek, the gap between the two countries is becoming dangerously narrower, Wang said in an interview with CNBC on Jan. 23.

You can opt out anytime. Earlier this week, DeepSeek released a second A.I. model that demonstrates reasoning capabilities rivaling those from top U.S. companies like OpenAI. In addition to shocking researchers with its performance, the Chinese startup’s rapid progress has raised questions about the effectiveness of A.I. chip export controls intended to curb China’s access to the advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) underpinning A.I. tools. “The A.I. race and the A.I. war between the U.S. and China is one of the most important issues of today,” said Wang, who recently took out a full-page advertisement in The Washington Post urging the Trump administration to protect America’s lead over the emerging technology. The advertisement pointed readers to a letter from Wang that claimed China’s A.I. models are quickly catching up and called upon the federal government to pour more money into compute and data and unleash an energy plan to support the A.I. boom, among other recommendations. Wang is one of the world’s youngest self-made billionaires. He was born and raised in Los Alamos, New Mexico, as the son of weapons physicists who worked at the famed Los Alamos National Laboratory. After a brief stint in Silicon Valley working for fintech company Addepar and Q&A website Quora, Wang began studying machine learning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before dropping out to establish Scale AI, which uses contract work to provide troves of accurately labeled data for A.I. training efforts. Scale AI was valued at $13.8 billion last year and counts the U.S. Department of Defense and OpenAI among its clients. Wang is longtime friends with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, having roomed with him during the Covid-19 pandemic. He launched Scale AI in 2016 within Y Combinator, the startup accelerator formerly helmed by Altman. Scale AI also recently partnered with the Center for A.I. Safety to release “Humanity’s Last Exam,” which they described as the toughest benchmark test yet for A.I. systems. While no model has been able to achieve more than 10 percent on the test so far, Wang said DeepSeek’s new reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1, has topped the leaderboard. “Their model is actually the top-performing, or roughly on par with the best American models,” he told CNBC. Due to tough GPU export controls in China, DeepSeek claims it has managed to create powerful models with far less computing power compared to American systems. DeepSeek-V3, the model released in December, was trained on around 2,000 A.I. chips from Nvidia (NVDA), according to DeepSeek researchers. Meta (META)’s Llama 3.1 model, for reference, was trained on 16,000 GPUs. Wang isn’t convinced. “The Chinese labs have more H100s than people think,” he said, referring to a type of Nvidia GPU that isn’t legally available in China. “My understanding is that DeepSeek has about 50,000 H100s—which they can’t talk about, obviously, because it is against the export controls that the United States has put in place.” To continue pushing its frontier models, the U.S. must unlock more computational capacity and infrastructure, according to Wang, who believes the A.I. market is on track to be worth $1 trillion once A.I. achieves the benchmark of artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). While A.I. leaders have offered up various timelines and meanings for A.G.I., Wang’s definition refers to systems that “could basically be a remote worker in the most capable way,” an achievement he believes will be accomplished in the next two to four years.

Title: Trump’s $500B Stargate A.I. Project: What Will It Build and Does It Actually Have the Money?
URL: https://observer.com/2025/01/trumps-500b-stargate-ai-project/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T18:21:09Z

On Tuesday (Jan. 21), President Donald Trump announced an A.I. initiative called Stargate. During a press conference at the White House attended by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank (SFTBF) CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, the returning President told reporters the initiative will invest $500 billion—equivalent to almost 2 percent of the annual U.S. economic output—over the next four years to bolster A.I. infrastructure in the U.S. and help the nation gain an edge over China. Trump estimates the Stargate will create 100,000 jobs. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. OpenAI will lead the project alongside Oracle, SoftBank and the UAE government’s tech investment Arm, MGX. Other key players in the tech alliance include Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Arm. Seemingly a nod to Roland Emmerich’s 1994 sci-fi film “Stargate,” which explores the concept of intergalactic portals—Stargate will develop “physical and virtual infrastructure” to power advanced A.I. systems, according to the President. The project is launching with an immediate $100 billion funding commitment to address critical challenges in A.I. infrastructure, such as the need for cutting-edge data centers across the U.S. and the electricity to power them. The partnership capitalizes on OpenAI’s established ties with Nvidia, which began in 2016, and a newer collaboration with Oracle, leveraging the company’s expertise in data centers and enterprise analytics. SoftBank’s financial resources further bolster the project, but details remain scarce. Nvidia and Oracle didn’t respond to requests for comment by Observer. Stargate’s first data center, which will span one million square feet, is already under construction in Abilene, Texas, Ellison said at this week’s press conference, adding that “more will be built” across other U.S. locations. Tech leaders not involved in the project are skeptical about its viability, especially given its massive size. Elon Musk, who has been vocal in his criticism of OpenAI, challenged the viability of the project’s funding. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on X. “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.” Altman responded to Musk’s doubt by offering to show him the ongoing construction of the data centers. “Want to come visit the first site already under way?,” Altman wrote in a retort on X. “I realize what is great for the country isn’t always what’s optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you’ll mostly put America first.” Musk also questioned Altman’s newfound support for Trump, citing his anti-Trump tweets during the 2016 Presidential election. He shared a screenshots of Altman’s 2021 post where the OpenAI CEO expressed gratitude to LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman for funding legal efforts to preventing Trump’s re-election in 2020. In a post yesterday, Altman said watching the President more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him. I’m not going to agree with him on everything, but I think he will be incredible for the country in many ways!” Big tech companies are racing to build their own data centers. Amazon’s AWS recently pledged $11 billion to expand data centers in Georgia; Meta announced a $10 billion A.I. hub in Louisiana; and Musk’s xAI recently built a data center in Memphis. At the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed Musk’s remarks on Stargate, reaffirming the company’s $80 billion commitment to expanding A.I. infrastructure globally. “All I know is, I’m good for my $80 billion,” Nadella said. “And all this money is not about hyping A.I., but is about building useful things for the real world!” He commented under Musk’s post on X. Despite the tensions, experts see the project as a necessary step to secure the U.S.’s leadership in the global A.I. race. “Stargate Project is the foundation we need to power the next generation of A.I. agents,” Claudionor Coelho, chief A.I. officer of the cloud security company Zscaler, told Observer. Matt Zeiler, founder and CEO of the deep learning and A.I. lifecycle platform Clarifai, said for Stargate to be truly successful, it must make a mark across multiple domains. He pointed to the rapid progress of foundational A.I. models in fields ranging from protein folding to patient communication. “In areas where A.I. architectures like transformers are already proving effective or where data can be easily tokenized, Stargate has the potential to be a game changer,” he told Observer.

Title: Trump's Stargate AI project backed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank is taking shape: Here's what we know

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. One of the Trump White House's first big announcements aligned itself with the artificial intelligence boom. In a splashy announcement on his second day in office, President Trump told Americans that a new $500 billion project — backed by SoftBank (SFTBY), Oracle (ORCL), and OpenAI — would generate “ over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately.” The project created a company called Stargate, which said in Tuesday's announcement it would “begin deploying $100 billion immediately" starting with data centers in Texas and spend an additional $400 billion over the next four years. Trump called the project, "a resounding declaration of confidence in America's potential under a new president." Microsoft (MSFT), AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and British chip designer Arm (ARM) were named as “key initial technology partners” by Stargate. The stocks of all companies involved soared, with Oracle and Nvidia rising 7% and 4%, respectively, the day after the announcement. But these early announcements have been followed by social media feuds featuring Elon Musk, questions about funding, and rival announcements about AI investments slated for this year. Trump's close ally, Elon Musk, took aim at Stargate’s backers on his social media platform X shortly after the announcement. Responding to a post from OpenAI about the project, he wrote, "They don’t actually have the money," adding, "SoftBank has well under $10B secured." Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, wrote back, “Wrong, as you surely know.” OpenAI has raised nearly $17 billion in the past two years and opened up a $4 billion credit line with various banks, though the company said it expected to lose $5 billion in 2024 while generating only $3.7 billion in revenue. OpenAI would need to raise an additional $19 billion to fund Stargate, according to The Information. A person familiar with Stargate refuted Musk's claims, telling Yahoo Finance that the project is indeed prepared to immediately deploy the initial $100 billion investment, noting that SoftBank had $24 billion in cash as of its most recent quarterly earnings. The Financial Times, citing unnamed sources, reported this week that Stargate has not yet secured its required funding, will receive no government financing, and will only serve OpenAI once completed. So far, only about 4% of Americans report using AI daily in their workplaces, though almost all Americans use AI-enabled products in their daily lives, often without realizing it. Then there’s the question of whether the project will hold true to Trump’s jobs promise, as data centers typically employ fewer than 100 people. Apple’s (AAPL) $1.3 billion data center project in Iowa, for example, committed to employing just 50 people in permanent positions, according to a Forbes investigation. All the while, critics say nondisclosure agreements between data centers and local officials mean residents are often left in the dark about the colossal buildings in their backyards driving up their utility bills. And some lawmakers argue that tax breaks for data centers aren’t worth the cost. Bloomberg reported this week that the first data center associated with Stargate in Abilene, Texas, will employ just 57 people at an average wage of $57,600 per year. On the heels of the Stargate announcement, Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post Friday that Meta (META) will spend between $60 billion and $65 billion in 2025, far higher than the estimated spending of $38 billion to $40 billion in 2024 it disclosed to investors back in October. Wall Street analysts had expected Meta's capital expenditures to tally closer to $51 billion this year, according to analysts tracked by Bloomberg. Much of Meta's spending would go into building a 2-gigawatt data center “that is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” Zuckerberg said. Two gigawatts is enough energy to power 700 electric vehicles for a full year. To be sure, proponents argue that the data centers have ripple effects on local economies. “Each direct job in the U.S. data center industry helps to create 7.4 ancillary jobs on average throughout the U.S. economy,” commercial real estate firm CBRE wrote in a report last year.

Title: The Perils of Abusing Leverage

Time Published: 2025-01-23T22:52:58Z

By Adam Sharp Posted January 23, 2025 In 2004, I imploded my first trading account. I was 24 years old and thought I was hot stuff. You see, I had just gotten my stockbroker and financial advisor licenses. I was young, naive, and ready to take on the world. My journey began trading hot stocks like Research in Motion (RIMM). On my second trade, I made $1,400. Wow, this is easy! That win was the worst thing that could have happened. I ramped it up and started using absurd amounts of leverage. Every trade was at least 30% of the account, and occasionally more than 100%. Swing trading, daytrading, momentum, I tried it all. And eventually my trading account balance ticked down to zero. That was my first and only account wipeout. It was a painful – but important – lesson. Fortunately I was young and didn’t have much to lose. I haven’t used margin since. I learned from the experience, and began holding the vast majority of my portfolio in long-term positions. Eventually I learned to use options properly, and those are now the only way I employ leverage. When buying options, potential losses are limited to your initial investment. And the possible upside is just as lucrative as margin. For most of us, however, options should make up a limited portion of our portfolios. Yes, the profit potential is high, but so can be the losses. Keep things balanced. I recently found a painful margin story on Reddit’s infamous WallStreetBets forum. Back in 2018, a user going by the handle “DubiouslyCurious” correctly predicted the rise of NVIDIA (NVDA). He saw that the company was moving beyond video game hardware and into the nascent AI space. So DubiouslyCurious went all-in on NVIDIA with his net worth of approximately £100,000 (British pounds). He used margin to leverage his position up 3x. For a while, everything was going according to plan. NVIDIA shares rose, and his position was in profit. DubiouslyCurious wrote that, “For the first time in my life, I saw a path to financial security.” And then 2020 happened. The COVID pandemic was a classic black swan event, and the crash wiped out his position. The chart below, posted by DubiouslyCurious himself, tells the story. The red line is his leveraged position, and the blue line shows how his investment would have performed without 3x leverage. Source: Yahoo Finance The story was hard to read. I felt that pain. He had correctly assessed NVIDIA’s prospects, but due to his aggressive use of leverage (combined with Dr. Fauci’s aggressive use of gain-of-function research on coronaviruses), he lost it all. “I sold when I had to take out the pittance remaining just to buy food. Ironically, of course, as soon as I sell it jumped back up. But by that point the damage had been done.” If he had simply bought NVIDIA shares without leverage, his position today would be worth over £2 million. Leverage is not something to be played with or taken lightly. With 3x margin, it only takes a 33% correction to wipe out a position. On top of that, you’re paying interest to borrow the funds. Many investors have a story like mine or DubiouslyCurious’. It’s practically an initiation ritual for traders. Most of us take a major loss at some point in our experience. The important thing is that we learn from our mistakes, and incorporate real change into our investing strategies going forward. The earlier an investor learns this lesson, the better. So in the near future I’m going to let my kids trade with $100 each. If the plan works, they’ll lose most of it. And by learning this lesson so early in life, they’ll be ahead of the game once they begin their real investing journey. Then I’ll teach them about the virtues of a long-term, balanced approach.

Title: Is Quantum Computing Investable As The Next AI ?

quantum computer The boom and bust and re-boom in quantum computing stocks over the last few weeks (look for example at the price gain and collapse and re-gain of RGTI, QBTS, QUBT, IONQ and others) has drawn comments from analysts that, on the one hand, equate quantum computing with a “bubble,” and on the other hand compare it with the early days of AI. Questions include: How far can quantum computing go? Can it challenge classical computing in the near future? Are quantum computing stocks worth investing in? Is one of these companies, or maybe one that is not even a company yet, but just in the heads of physicists somewhere in one of the tech universities around the world, the next big thing? Is this a lot of hocus pocus or a computational paradigm that might blow current capabilities out of the water and make NVDA look like, well, Intel of prior years? Investing in quantum computing is additionally scary today because the price of quantum computing stocks is being driven by both speculative instinct and the opinions of some of the rock stars of the AI revolution, who, if I may say so, probably do not know much more than the rest of us when it comes to forecasting the potential power and timing of when the strategy may become practical. One might be forgiven for thinking that comments regarding the near-term viability of quantum computing by Jensen Huang and Mark Zuckerberg from a few weeks ago are somewhat self-serving, looking to protect their turf from a potential new game-changing technology, though in fairness they are also quite involved in pushing the frontiers of quantum computing technology. For sure, if Nvidia has ushered in exponential growth in computational power behind AI, then the potential of quantum computing, which can provide a “double exponential” speedup in computation (this is known as Neven’s law), will make classical computing based on even the fastest NVDA GPUs look linear. And there are good reasons why NVDA cannot just come out and say quantum is the next big thing, because doing so would likely decimate the market for their current chips and the profitability that has propelled it to be the most valuable company in the world (as of the date of this writing). In the world of computing, linear speedup, even relatively speaking, is considered an insult, because quantum computing theoretically has the potential of not just exponential, but a “double exponential” speedup. So, the simple answer to whether practical quantum computing is on the horizon in the near future is that no one really knows. It is similar to the task of predicting the probability that a meteor will hit the earth over the next decade. We simply don’t know. But that should not prevent us from being somewhat prepared. To me, the real question is not whether practical quantum computing will happen in the next few years, but what are the consequences if it does, and how, as an investor can I rationally position myself for the rare but impactful consequences. The physical laws behind quantum computing are on solid ground, unlike many other fads like negative interest rates that were implemented in Germany, or perpetual motion machines of eras past. First, let us put some confusion to rest. There is already a “practical” quantum computer in operation today. As a matter of fact, it has been in operation for as long as our physical world has existed. Yes, current physics says that nature is a massive quantum computer. I did my Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics, in the area of Quantum Field Theory, which strangely enough, works amazingly well in explaining the real world. The fact that nature seems to obey the rules of quantum mechanics all the way down to elementary particles and beyond is now beyond doubt. I also had the distinct pleasure of being at Caltech around the time that Nobel laureate Richard Feynman started to seriously think about quantum computers and around when he uttered the famous quote that “Nature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical”. In other words, even the fastest NVDA chips only get you a classical approximation to the real thing when it comes to simulation. It is akin to trying to simulate the nature of sub-atomic particles by applying Newton’s laws to smaller and faster bouncing balls. At some point the classical simulation will just fail because bouncing balls will never be able to replicate the peculiar quantum mechanical laws obeyed by sub-atomic particles. There are indeed problems today, though somewhat academic, that are practically impossible for classical computers to solve. As far as practicality goes, let’s not forget that the period between when proclamations were made that humans could not fly to when airplanes showed it could be done was quite short. What it took was a change of mindset and the development of a parallel framework - humans fly in planes by understanding the basic principles of aerodynamics, not by flapping their wings like birds. The quantum approach to computing will also develop parallel ways of solving the problems of computation, and they cannot be extrapolated from classical ways of computing. Its a new paradigm, and new paradigms can quickly shatter the constraints of old paradigms. After close to three decades of research, quantum computers have been built that can theoretically solve problems that cannot be solved on a classical computer (see the discussion of “quantum supremacy,” and a more sober look in light of recent claims by the Google team here by one of my other professors from Caltech, the theoretical physicist John Preskill), and the question now is not whether quantum computers that can exceed current classical computing is possible, but how hard really the current problems like error correction are. Impossible is bad, hard is good! The history of human innovation is that when the possibility of a game-changing technology exists, the speed at which hard problems become easier to solve is much faster than linear thinking allows us to imagine. When the rate at which the innovation — i.e. quantum computing’s rate of growth — is doubly exponential, not just exponential, the possibility of missing the inflection point is very real. And much of the acceleration in such situations also comes from incumbents who are competing amongst themselves for the next big thing. No wonder that after tanking quantum computing stocks, NVDA announced a” Quantum Day” at its GTC conference on March 20 (here). To me, it seems that the commercial race is already on, though it might be beneficial to do the development in stealth mode for most so they don’t get crushed out of their path to progress. This brings me to investability. Stock market investing is always risky, and speculative stock-market investing, as in quantum computing stocks (or AI, turn-of-the-century dot-coms or Bitcoin not too long ago), is doubly risky. But the upside compensation for taking the risk can also be large, which might justify a thoughtful, carefully considered, small allocation, to moonshot investments. The precise modeling of potential gains and losses for such speculative investments is basically impossible. At the simplest level, one can simply think of investing in such stocks as a biased coin flip experiment, where the odds of the coin flip coming up heads — i.e. a “win” is some number you make up — and the odds of the stock going belly up (i.e. price falling to zero), is one minus that number. An unbiased coin would have a probability of coming up heads or coming up tails to be equal or 50%. What makes things even more tricky is that these odds are dynamic and ever-changing, and can be subject to the opinions of experts who also know very little about the future but still have influence on pricing. Which means that proper sizing, or allocation of capital, is one of the only ways to ensure that one can stay the course, “HODL,” and not be shaken out. The mathematics of biased coin-flip betting is well known. As a matter of fact, it forms the foundation of all option pricing. For our purposes here let us imagine that the coin we are tossing has a very low probability of coming up heads. If this probability is labelled p, then the expected value, or average return over many such bets, assuming equal payoffs in the win and the loss states, is simply equal to p. So if the probability of success is 10% on one trial, then over many independent trials, the expected payoff can be estimated by multiplying 10% by the payoff if there is success. The lower the probability of success, the lower the expected value. Just like lottery tickets which have a very low probability of success, the expected value of speculative stock investing is very low. But that’s not the end of the story. As one would expect, both lottery tickets and speculative stocks have massive “skewness” and “kurtosis” when the probability of success is low, despite having very low expected value. Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of payoffs, and kurtosis is a measure of how “fat” the tail is. For a coin toss with probability of success p, the skewness and kurtosis both go to infinity when the probability of success is very low. This should not be a shocking result — we all know how low probability investments, e.g. bitcoin, can deliver massive returns (just recall bitcoin’s experience over the last few years). While it is easy to pooh pooh those dumb souls who bet on fat right tails, or lottery ticket-like investments, the fact of the matter is that such investments can make life-changing impact for investors, if they are made at a time when the price is not already discounting the massive positive returns. For a stock bought cheaply enough, this upside potential can counter the low expected return. Also note that both the skewness and kurtosis for a coin toss is minimum when the risks are balanced; i.e. the probability of success and failure are equal to 50% each. The danger of investing in such speculative investments arises from taking on too much exposure. This is because a low probability of success effectively guarantees that on average, returns will be low or negative. So, the bet one is making really is that by investing at the right price, the potential of outsized gains on the winners makes up for the almost certain losses on the losers. Again, as most readers undoubtedly know or have read, the optimal exposure that maximizes the long term growth rate of simple binary investments is given by the almost too simple (and magical) Kelly criterion (see here) which says that the optimal fraction to invest is simply p-(1-p)/b, where b are the odds upon success. For example, if one bets a dollar and upon a win is returned three dollars, and upon a loss loses the one dollar he bet, then b=2. So, we can see that if the probability of success is very low, then the payoff has to be very high for a profitable bet to be possible. If the payoff is not high enough then the optimal allocation must be very small. Let us calibrate this to investing in quantum computing. If we believe that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computation, then it is not hard to imagine a 100 to 1 payoff though it could take years for this to happen. So, if the probability of success is 5% , then the “optimal” fraction to bet at this enormous potential payout is about 4% of the portfolio. In this example, the investor should bet nothing if the potential payoff is less than about 19 times (obtained by dividing the probability of failure which is 95% by the probability of success which is 5%). In its current state, no one knows which type of quantum computing technology and which company will succeed. So, it also behooves the investor to divvy up the total allocation amongst many different technologies. Clearly, I take the view that quantum computing is very risky but investable, regardless of what the talking heads say, as long as there is potential for massive upside, the entry price is right, and as long as the exposure is kept small enough to not create a situation where the investor is forced out at the wrong time. The gut wrenching 50% decline in one day on an off-the-cuff comment by Jensen Huang last week illustrates that those who had positions too large or leveraged probably got forced out at the wrong price, creating the buying opportunity for those who were able to step in at the right size. At the end of the day, sizing exposures is probably as important, if not more important than getting the direction of investments right for any investment. In the case of highly speculative moonshots like quantum computing stocks, sizing things right — i.e. big enough but not too big —and owning the upside, skewness and the kurtosis, is probably the approach that balances out the risks with the potential of outsized returns. Just as there are catastrophic “left tails” which can destroy value, there are also “right tails”, which, if not managed for, can create massive missed opportunities. Like they say — you have to be “in it to win it.” Just be careful how much you risk. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

US stocks faltered on Thursday, pulling back from a bid for fresh records as AI optimism waned and markets waited for more detail on President Donald Trump's tariff plans. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.2% higher, with a record high not far off. Meanwhile, The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped, as fellow megacap techs Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) also lost ground. Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. The focus is now on Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos later Thursday for more insight into his trade policy. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Shares in Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) edged lower after business shifts by the tech leaders in Canada, a prime tariff target for Trump. The e-commerce giant will close its warehouses in Quebec, with a loss of about 1,700 jobs, while Tesla plans hefty price hikes on all its EV models sold in Canada. Eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set that tone on Wednesday. GE Aerospace (GE) shares popped after the jet engine maker said it will raise share buybacks to $7 billion. In air carriers, American Airlines (AAL) stock slid after a downbeat 2025 profit forecast, and Alaska Airlines (ALK) shares rose thanks to a smaller-than-expected first quarter loss forecast. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to poor performance of two of its video games: its soccer title, EA Sports FC 2025, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Both of those missed expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on February 4.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks were mixed Thursday as investors stayed attuned to remarks from President Donald Trump, who addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.6% higher, with a record not far off. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell around 0.2% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped after its supplier SK Hynix (000660.KS) flagged uncertainty about chip demand this year, which also weighed on other related stocks. The focus turned to Trump's remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos for more insight into his trade policy. The president said he will "demand that interest rates drop immediately." He also said he will ask OPEC to bring down the price of oil. On the tariff front, the president offered a warning to companies. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff."

Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Meanwhile, eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set the stage for next week's Big Tech flurry. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. President Trump said he will ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia to bring down the price of oil. "I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down," said Trump during his remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately. Right now the price is high enough that that war will continue, you've got to bring down the oil price. You've got to end that war," he said. Russia, a major producer of oil and gas, is an OPEC ally. The cartel currently has production cuts in place in order to keep a floor on prices. Both West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) fell roughly 1% following Trump's comments. President Trump said he will demand that interest rates drop in the US. "I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us,” Trump said remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved to a session high, up 0.5% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell slightly. President Trump spoke remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing via video to a packed room of CEOs and world officials. The President first listed a series of actions he took upon entering the White House, including withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and declaring a national energy emergency. On the topic of tariffs, the President said: "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth." "But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff. Attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos are waiting for President Trump's special address via video. Investors watching the remote speech will pay attention to any talk about the President's tariff policy. President Trump will also take questions after his remarks. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose after Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a post on X that she will chair the Senate Banking Subcommittee on digital assets. The token moved up to about $105,000 at around 10:50 a.m. ET. Earlier this week, Lummis said she spoke with Eric Trump about the possibility of creating a strategic bitcoin reserve at the inaugural lunch on Monday. Late last year, she introduced a proposal that would give the Federal Reserve the right to own the cryptocurren. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Chip stocks fell across the board early on Thursday after a Nvidia (NVDA) supplier made comments on its earnings call that indicated uncertainty about semiconductor demand this year. South Korea-based SK Hynix (000660.KS) makes memory chips for Nvidia’s GPUs (graphics processing units), which are used in data centers to underpin artificial intelligence software. After SK Hynix reported fourth quarter earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations, its head of finance, Woo-Hyun Kim, painted a careful picture of the year ahead. “2025's memory demand outlook is clouded by inventory adjustments from PC and smartphone OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] as well as strengthened protective trade policies and geopolitical risks,” Kim said on a post-earnings conference call. Following the comments, Nvidia shares sank as much as 2%. British chip designer Arm's (ARM) stock dropped nearly 6%, and SK Hynix rival Micron (MU) shares fell roughly 4%. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports from Davos: Up and down the promenade at the World Economic Forum this week, leaders agree on one thing about artificial intelligence: It's darn powerful, and it's starting to materially impact how business is done and will be done. Think AI on the cusp of rendering human call centers and HR departments obsolete. What leaders can't agree on is whether AI is already out of control — whether it's beyond the point of being successfully regulated or having the proper guardrails. "I'm not sure it's [AI] out of control. I think there are use cases that sometimes people want to showcase [for] ... their own benefits, to see, hey, this is the potential. But the reality is that enterprises are very smart," HPE CEO Antonio Neri told Yahoo Finance at the annual gathering of top business leaders. Read more here. American Airlines (AAL) stock fell nearly 8% after the carrier forecast a surprise loss for its first quarter. The outlook is a departure from the major air travel carriers' bullish performance in recent quarters. American expects an adjusted loss of as much as $0.40 a share for the current quarter. Analysts were expecting a profit of at least $0.01, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The airline posted record fourth quarter revenue of $13.7 billion and record full-year revenue of $54.2 billion. The company's profit for the current quarter is expected to be impacted by a rise in non-fuel expenses as it continues to win back business after changing its corporate sales strategy. American had implemented changes that pushed corporate customers to book directly with the airline, instead of third-party travel managers. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to the poor performance of two of its video games: soccer title "EA Sports FC 2025" and "Dragon Age: The Veilguard." Both of those missed bookings expectations.

Title: AI crypto coins take over: Is Trump’s $500B investment behind it all?

The future of crypto is AI—and it’s happening now. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has real-world applications across industries like business, technology, healthcare, and finance. The crypto sector is no exception, with AI-based tokens now commanding a market cap of $48 billion. Trump’s ‘no crypto’ stance may have rattled the broader market, but his $500 billion AI investment sent AI crypto coins soaring, with low-caps jumping 15% in 24 hours. Nvidia (NVDA) has now dethroned Apple (AAPL) as the world’s largest company, with a market cap soaring to $311 trillion – up 4.43% since Trump’s $500 billion AI investment. This is a clear sign that the AI revolution is taking off. AI-based crypto tokens aren’t far behind. In just two years, the market cap of AI-focused crypto coins surged by a massive 2,592%, reaching a staggering $70 billion by November last year. Leading the charge? NEAR Protocol [NEAR], boasting a solid market value of $5.89 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap But that’s just the beginning. Take Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), for instance, jumping into the ‘AI agent’ space, which Microsoft’s CEO just called the future of software development. Clearly, these coins are tapping into the tech to create real-world applications that are catching the eye of both individuals and institutional investors. However, the AI crypto market isn’t immune to volatility. In just two months, its market cap took a 31% dip, as the broader crypto market saw massive profit-taking. Can Trump’s $500 billion AI investment turn things around? Right now, Trump’s actions are shaking up the crypto world. Take the TRUMP memecoin, for example, which has seen billions in market cap vanish after Trump’s ‘no crypto’ stance in his first 42 executive orders. Bitcoin is also feeling the squeeze, with its market share down 7% to $2.02 trillion. And AI crypto coins? They’re not immune, with many slipping into the red. Source: CoinMarketCap But there’s hope on the horizon. Trump’s massive $500 billion investment could spark a major rebound for AI tokens. We’ve seen these coins surge after Nvidia’s quarterly reports in the past, and with AI sentiment at an all-time high in the U.S., the future looks promising. Read NEAR Protocol’s [NEAR] Price Prediction 2025–2026 The road ahead won’t be easy, though. AI crypto coins need to break free from Bitcoin’s volatility and carve out their own space. But with a 2592% growth in less than three years, they’re on the right track. As tech giants gear up for the AI revolution, more capital could flood into the AI crypto coins. 2025 could be their year – definitely one to watch.

Title: Microsoft Eases Control on OpenAI in $500B Venture

In a significant development within the tech industry, Microsoft (MSFT) announced on Tuesday that it has revised key terms of its longstanding partnership with OpenAI. This change comes in the wake of OpenAI's announcement of a joint venture with Oracle (ORCL) and Japan's SoftBank Group aimed at establishing a groundbreaking $500 billion network of AI data centers in the United States. The partnership dubbed the "Stargate" initiative, is designed to bolster the U.S.'s position in the global AI race, particularly against competitors like China. During a press conference at the White House, President Donald Trump unveiled the Stargate project, emphasizing its importance for national competitiveness. The initiative aims to leverage advanced chips from Nvidia (NVDA) to enhance AI capabilities across various sectors. As part of this venture, OpenAI will have an equity stake and operational control, with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son appointed as chairman of the board. Historically, Microsoft has held exclusive rights to provide cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI since 2019. However, the new agreement allows OpenAI to explore additional capacity options, primarily for research and model training. This shift opens the door for OpenAI to collaborate with Oracle and potentially other cloud service providers. Despite these changes, Microsoft reassured stakeholders that its core partnership with OpenAI remains intact. The tech giant retains exclusive rights to offer OpenAI's API—an essential revenue source for the company—ensuring that Oracle will not host this critical service. In a blog post, Microsoft stated that "the key elements of our partnership remain in place for the duration of our contract through 2030," including access to OpenAI's intellectual property and ongoing revenue-sharing arrangements. Microsoft also highlighted a recent commitment from OpenAI to utilize its Azure cloud services extensively, further solidifying their collaborative efforts. This commitment underscores Microsoft's role as a significant investor and partner in advancing OpenAI's technology. As the landscape of AI development evolves, this partnership adjustment signals a strategic pivot for both Microsoft and OpenAI. The Stargate project represents one of the largest investments in AI infrastructure to date, with initial funding of $100 billion set to expand over four years. This ambitious plan aims not only to enhance AI capabilities but also to create jobs and foster innovation within the U.S. The collaboration between Microsoft, Oracle, and other technology partners like Nvidia and Arm will be crucial in building out this infrastructure. As noted by Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison during the announcement, construction is already underway in Texas, with plans for multiple data centers designed to support expansive AI operations. This evolving landscape presents an exciting opportunity for innovation in artificial intelligence. The collaboration between major players like Microsoft and OpenAI illustrates a commitment to advancing technology while navigating competitive pressures. As these companies work together to build robust AI infrastructure, it will be interesting to see how they balance exclusivity agreements with collaborative efforts that benefit the broader tech ecosystem. As we witness these transformative partnerships unfold, it is essential for stakeholders—be they investors, developers, or consumers—to stay informed about how these changes will impact technological advancements and market dynamics in the coming years. The future of AI is not just about competition; it's about collaboration that drives progress and innovation forward. ©2025 C# Corner. All contents are copyright of their authors.

Title: What to know about 'Stargate,' the $500 billion AI infrastructure project touted by Trump

After scrapping the Biden administration’s executive order on artificial intelligence, President Donald Trump announced a half-a-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure plan alongside some of the technology’s top leaders. The president was joined by OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, SoftBank (SFTBY) chief executive Masayoshi Son, and Oracle (ORCL) chief technology officer Larry Ellison at the White House on Tuesday evening where he announced the Stargate Project, the largest in U.S. history. The new joint venture “intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,” the AI startup said in a statement. Stargate is starting with an initial $100 billion investment and counts OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi-based AI investor MGX as initial equity funders. Here’s what else you need to know about the Stargate Project. The Stargate project is investing in building new data centers and other AI infrastructure in the U.S. The investment “will secure” the U.S.’s AI leadership, provide hundreds of thousands of jobs, “and generate massive economic benefit for the entire world,” according to OpenAI. Stargate will “support the re-industrialization of the United States” and “provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies,” the startup added. SoftBank and OpenAI are co-leading the project, with SoftBank taking financial responsibility and OpenAI overseeing operations. Son will be Stargate’s chairman. Elon Musk, a close Trump ally with his own AI startup, responded to the news on X that he has “on good authority” that the Japanese bank “has well under $10B secured.” Altman responded that Musk was “wrong” and invited the billionaire to visit the first site under construction. Along with OpenAI and Oracle, British chip design firm Arm (which SoftBank has a 90% stake in), Nvidia (NVDA), and OpenAI’s longstanding partner, Microsoft (MSFT), will be “key technology partners” in the project. OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia will work together on the project’s first buildout in Texas, OpenAI said, adding that the computing system is a result of a years-long collaboration between it and Nvidia, and a new partnership between it and Oracle. Ellison said Tuesday that the project’s first data centers are already under construction. “Each building is a half a million square feet,” Ellison said. “There are 10 buildings currently being built, but that will expand to 20 and other locations beyond the Abilene location, which is our first location.” The project is still evaluating other potential sites and finalizing definitive agreements. OpenAI said the project builds on its relationship with its largest investor and exclusive compute provider, Microsoft. The startup plans to continue increasing its use of Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service, it said, alongside the “additional compute” from Stargate. In March, The Information reported that OpenAI and Microsoft were planning a U.S.-based data center that could cost up to $100 billion and house a supercomputer made up of millions of AI chips — also called “Stargate.” However, after it raised a $6.6 billion funding round in October, The Information reported that OpenAI was looking for other data center deals after its chief financial officer Sarah Friar had previously told some shareholders it wasn’t getting enough compute power fast enough from the tech giant. Microsoft said on Tuesday that a new agreement with OpenAI “includes changes to the exclusivity on new capacity” and will follow a model where Microsoft has the right of first refusal. “To further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models,” the company said. In an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the company will continue spending $80 billion building out its cloud computing and that “customers can count on Microsoft with OpenAI models being there everywhere in the world.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: People are buying the wrong stock thinking it's part of OpenAI's Stargate Project

MGX stock is soaring Wednesday on the heels of the company’s involvement with OpenAI and SoftBank’s (SFTBY) new Stargate project. There’s just one minor problem — it’s the stock ticker for the wrong MGX. MGX represents shares of Metagenomi Inc., a biotechnology company focused on leveraging genome editing tools. Last week, the company said it is working on bringing its experimental treatment for hemophilia A to clinical trials in 2026. Investors were likely confused by a press release announcing that MGX would be among the initial equity funders in the Stargate Project, which seeks to invest $500 billion over the next four years in new artificial intelligence infrastructure for OpenAI. The MGX referenced there is a technology fund based in the United Arab Emirates. The likely misunderstanding propelled Metagenomi stock up by as much as 33% on Wednesday before gains were pared back down to a 25% increase. Shares are down 67% for the last 12 months and 24% over the last six months. As for Stargate, the project is expected to be a major boost to the U.S. economy and OpenAI, according to the people backing it. President Donald Trump, who was joined by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, and Oracle’s (ORCL) Larry Ellison at the White House — said it would generate more than 100,000 jobs. The group’s first project, a one-million-square-foot data project, is already underway in Texas. Although the backers plan to eventually spend $500 billion, the companies said they would deploy $100 billion “immediately.” Stargate will be chaired by Son, whose SoftBank will have financial responsibility for the company, while OpenAI handles the operations. Those companies, along with Oracle and MGX, are the initial equity backers. SoftBank-backed Arm, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) will work with Oracle and OpenAI on the technology. However, not everyone is fully on board with Stargate. Atreides Management Chief Investment Office Gavin Baker, who also noted the MGX mix-up, called the $500 billion “a ridiculous number” that “no one should take seriously” unless SoftBank sold their Arm and Alibaba (BABA) stock. “And I say all of this as someone who is really optimistic about AI in every way,” Baker added in a post on X. “Stargate is fiction wrapped around a much less impressive reality.” Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump’s with his own federal task force, agrees. In a series of posts late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday morning, Musk said he has it on “good authority” that SoftBank has less than $10 billion secured. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on X, replying to an OpenAI post announcing Stargate. Musk, an OpenAI co-founder who left the startup and has a longstanding feud with Altman and the startup, also has his own AI company, xAI. His firm raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation. That cash is expected to help xAI expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, which it developed with Nvidia chips.

Title: Elon Musk bashes the $500 billion 'Stargate' deal between OpenAI and SoftBank — and backed by Trump
URL: https://qz.com/elon-musk-stargate-ai-openai-trump-softbank-nvidia-1851744596
Time Published: 2025-01-22T13:22:00Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk is already casting doubt on OpenAI’s new, up to $500 billion investment deal with SoftBank (SFTBY) and Oracle (ORCL), despite backing from his allies — including President Donald Trump. The companies are teaming up for what they call the “Stargate Project,” presumably named after the sci-fi franchise, which aims to spend $500 billion over the next four years building artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. The companies said Tuesday that they would begin deploying $100 billion “immediately,” which will “generate massive economic benefit for the entire world.” As the deal was announced Tuesday in the White House, Trump — standing alongside Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son — said the group would create a “new American company” that would generate more than 100,000 U.S. jobs. Ellison said the group’s first project, a one-million-square-foot data project, is already underway in Texas. There’s just one problem with Stargate, according to Musk, an OpenAI co-founder who has since sued to block it and Altman’s plans: They don’t have the cash. “They don’t actually have the money,” the Tesla (TSLA) CEO and close Trump ally said shortly before midnight on Tuesday, in a post on his social media site X. “SoftBank has well under $10 [billion] secured. I have that on good authority,” Musk added just before 1 a.m. ET. His comments marked a rare split between the world’s richest man and Trump, who took office on Monday. Musk was one of Trump’s biggest financial backers during the 2024 presidential campaign and has been given his own task force, nicknamed DOGE, and staff. The Trump administration is already facing at least four lawsuits over DOGE. Musk’s remarks also show that, despite Altman and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos’ comments last month, Musk isn’t content to sit by as his rivals profit from the new Trump administration. Altman said in December that he believes “pretty strongly that Elon would do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power” against business rivals. Besides Musk’s long-standing feud with Altman and litigation, he also founded an AI startup, xAI, to compete with OpenAI and other firms. xAI last month raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, less than two years after he founded the company. That cash is expected to help xAI expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, which it developed with Nvidia (NVDA) chips. xAI also works closely with Musk’s X. His social media platform, formerly Twitter, employs Grok, a chatbot developed by his xAI startup. Ellison is an investor in X, formerly served on Tesla’s board, and the pair of billionaires have a longtime friendship. “[I] genuinely respect your accomplishments and think you are the most inspiring entrepreneur of our time,” Altman said Wednesday in reply to Musk’s accusations. Altman followed up by saying that Musk’s allegations are “wrong, as you surely know,” before inviting him to visit the site in Texas. “[T]his is great for the country,” Altman said. “[I] realize what is great for the country isn’t always what’s optimal for your companies, but in your new role [I] hope you’ll mostly put [America] first.” Stargate will be chaired by Son, whose SoftBank will have financial responsibility for the company, while OpenAI handles the operations. Those companies, along with Oracle and MGX, are the initial equity backers. SoftBank-backed Arm, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia will work with Oracle and OpenAI on the technology. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told CNBC on Wednesday that “I’m good for my $80 billion. I’m going to spend $80 billion building out Azure.” The initial $100 billion comes from a number of sources, including equity from the founding partners and co-investors, as well as third-party debt, according to a source familiar with the matter. Additional investors are expected to be brought on and help fund the project over its lifetime. “All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI—and in particular AGI—for the benefit of all of humanity,” OpenAI and SoftBank said in a statement. “We believe that this new step is critical on the path, and will enable creative people to figure out how to use AI to elevate humanity.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) has regained the top spot as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $3.46 trillion, above Apple (AAPL, Financial) $3.35 trillion. On Tuesday's trading, Nvidia rose 2.2 percent, and Apple fell 3.1 percent, sharply due to analyst downgrades, citing poor iPhone sales and a lacklustre consumer electronics market. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The fact that AI is dominating the decisions around this historic shift demonstrates why it will take over the economic world. Nvidia's rise is part of a surge in demand for the company's graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are critical for powering AI applications in autonomous vehicles, data centres and other high-growth sectors. Nvidia exceeded 100 percent earnings growth for its third quarter of 2024, along with a 94 percent jump in revenue to $35.1 billion. These results underscore how the company is a key enabler of AI transformations in industries. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said: "Our GPUs are driving the AI-driven transformation across industries." AI is at the heart of every business, and we are entering a new era of computing. Overall, the slowdown in these markets is illustrative of broader strategic issues impacting consumer electronics companies. The company has lost money, with their market cap down to $3.33 trillion compared to a high just a few months ago. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Stephen Nellis and Krystal Hu (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday said it has changed some key terms of a deal with OpenAI after the ChatGPT creator announced a joint venture with Oracle (ORCL) and Japan's SoftBank Group to build up to $500 billion of new AI data centers in the United States. President Donald Trump gathered the leaders of the "Stargate" effort at the White House on Tuesday to announce the deal, saying it was intended to help keep the United States ahead of China and other rivals in the global AI race, using chips from Nvidia (NVDA). Since 2019, Microsoft has had arrangements with OpenAI that gave the Redmond, Washington-based company the exclusive right to build new computing infrastructure for OpenAI. Microsoft, in a blog post, said it has "approved OpenAI's ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models." That opened the door for OpenAI to work with Oracle. A person familiar with the deal said that Stargate is a joint venture structured as new entity in which OpenAI has an equity stake, governance rights and operational control. It will have a separate board appointed by the founding members and its own CEO, this person said. The venture will also have other investors including United Arab Emirates firm MGX. Microsoft, along with Nvidia and Arm, will be a "technology partner" in the new venture, but is not listed as an equity funder. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son is will be the entity's board chairman, according to a statement from OpenAI posted on social media site X. But Microsoft said that it still retains the exclusive right to offer OpenAI's API - technology shorthand for application programming interface, which is the main way that software developers and business customers buy OpenAI's services. That means Oracle will not be able to host OpenAI's primary source of revenue. Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Microsoft's statements. Microsoft said it has "revenue sharing agreements that flow both ways" with OpenAI. "The key elements of our partnership remain in place for the duration of our contract through 2030, with our access to OpenAI’s IP, our revenue sharing arrangements and our exclusivity on OpenAI’s APIs all continuing forward," Microsoft said. Microsoft also said "OpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training," referring to Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service.

Nvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world’s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple’s (AAPL) shares slid. The chipmaker’s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker’s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia’s shares are up 2%. Jefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple’s rating to “Underperform” in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple’s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to “be weak,” Jefferies said, “because there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.” Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is “cautious” over demand for Apple’s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone — part of the SE series of smaller iPhones — is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras. “As Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,” Jefferies analysts said in the note. Meanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the “high teens” in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.

We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dumped 3 Tech Stocks and Betting On These 4 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. Chen Tianqiao is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur and investor, best known for founding Shanda Interactive Entertainment, one of the leading internet and gaming companies in China during the early 2000s. Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Through his innovative approach to technology and business, Chen has become one of the pioneers of the online gaming industry and a significant figure in the global tech and neuroscience communities. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Chen Tianqiao was born in 1973 in the Zhejiang province of China. Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry. In 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 Shanda Asset Management's Stake: $121.4 million NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company's investment potential is driven by following several factors. To begin with, the investors may consider the company’s financial growth as a top factor. As illustrated in the report of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per diluted share was 0.78 dollars, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Additionally, the company’s quarterly net income was 19.3 billion dollars, up 16% from the second quarter and up 112% from a year ago. The second most compelling factor that may attract investment is the launch of its project DIGITS, the world’s smallest AI supercomputer capable of running 200B-parameter models. Moreover, the firm has launched the NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of APIs, SDKs, and services that enable developers to integrate OpenUSD, NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies, and generative AI into existing software tools and simulation workflows for industrial and robotic use cases. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

US stocks traded in the green on Tuesday, but tech lagged as investors digested President Donald Trump's first policy moves, with future tariffs on Mexico and Canada front of mind. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. But the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was broadly flat as the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) struggled. Wall Street is bracing for volatility as the new president storms ahead with executive orders and actions, with energy and trade center stage. It's the first day of trading in Trump's second term, as US markets were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Markets got a dose of relief as Trump held off from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes expected by many on his first day in office. China got a surprise reprieve as Trump failed to act on promised high duties on its imports. US stock futures rose, and the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) pulled back from a near two-year high on Monday. But the mood shifted after Trump said later in the day that he was looking at imposing 25% duties for Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1. And Chinese stocks (000300.SS) closed out Tuesday with only slight gains, suggesting investors aren't convinced that a US-China reset is coming to avert a trade war. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell about 4 basis points to around 4.57% early on Tuesday, recovering somewhat from a deeper drop in Asia trading. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been on a ride, rising to a record higher above $109,000 on Monday as Trump was sworn in and the new president issued an official TRUMP "meme coin" token. The leading digital currency then fell steeply early Tuesday after a hoped-for pro-crypto push failed to appear in the first policy actions. It was trading lower but still above $103,000 at last check. The next batch of quarterly earnings will provide more food for thought for investors. Netflix (NFLX) is expected to deliver strong results when it reports after the bell. Meanwhile, earnings at Charles Schwab (SCHW) soared nearly 50% as trading activity climbed by double digits. D.R. Horton (DHI) also beat expectations despite a soft housing market, while 3M Company (MMM) issued optimistic full-year guidance, driven by organic sales growth. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 4% in early trading Tuesday, reversing premarket gains on the first trading day since the inauguration of Donald Trump as the president scrapped a pro-EV policy put into place by his predecessor. On his first day in office, Trump wasted no time shedding the skin of the outgoing administration, revoking 78 executive orders made by former Democratic President Joe Biden during his tenure. One of those Biden-era policies that was revoked mandated that half of the new US cars manufactured be electric by 2030. Other EV stocks fell on the news. Lucid (LCID) tumbled nearly 7% while Rivian (RIVN) slid 5%. Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) stocks were up. US stocks climbed across the board on Tuesday as investors digested President Donald Trump's first wave of executive orders, with future tariffs on China and Mexico at the forefront of stock traders' minds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also climbed about 0.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and other tech megacaps boosted the overall index. Economic data: No notable economic data releases.
