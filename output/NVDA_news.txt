Title: Why Nvidia's Earnings Report Wednesday Is More Important Than You Think

A lot is at stake when the world's most valuable public company reports earnings Wednesday. Nvidia's (NVDA) latest quarterly financial update, due after the closing bell, is being widely viewed as the biggest event of this earnings season. It could have wide-reaching implications for the AI trade and the broader stock market. A strong showing from the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, viewed as a bellwether for the industry, could prove just what the market needs to revive confidence in the AI rally that boosted shares of Nvidia, its partners, and stocks across industries this year, pushing the major indexes to a series of record highs. However, with expectations riding high and signs investors may be more difficult to impress amid persistent worries that elevated stock valuations have created an AI bubble, the stock could be primed for punishment if Nvidia's results are anything less than stellar. Nvidia's quarterly results and outlook could sway sentiment surrounding a host of stocks tied to the AI boom. The chipmaker's outsized influence on major indexes and funds that track them also means a big move in its stock would affect a wide range of investors. With the chipmaker facing a particularly challenging setup heading into Wednesday night's event, some investors are already bracing for enhanced volatility in its wake. Options pricing suggests traders see shares swinging roughly 7% in either direction by the end of the week. Nvidia's outsized influence on major indexes—with a market capitalization of around $4.4 trillion, the stock accounts for about 8% of the S&P 500—also means a big move in its stock would impact the market broadly. And if Nvidia's shares soar or slump, those of its partners and others related to AI likely will too. Even if you don’t hold Nvidia stock directly, a big share price move could affect you if you hold money in broad market index funds through brokerage accounts or tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as a 401(k) or IRA. Options pricing indicates traders expect the S&P 500 could move close to 2% in either direction by the end of the week, affecting a wide swath of investors and savers. In recent quarters, the AI chipmaker's quarterly report has tended to be a sell-the-news event, with the stock finishing the week of its earning lower than its levels heading into the event in three of the last four quarters, despite strong results. However, Nvidia's stock has typically picked up in the months that followed. The shares, which slid nearly 3% Tuesday amid broader losses, have still added over one-third of their value this year so far. Most Wall Street analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha believe the stock has room to rise.

Title: Peter Thiel's Hedge Fund Dumped Nvidia Shares Just Before Its Big Earnings Report
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/peter-thiel-s-hedge-fund-dumped-nvidia-shares-just-before-its-big-earnings-report-11851890
Time Published: 2025-11-18T21:25:01Z
Full Content:
While everybody is watching for Nvidia’s earnings report tomorrow, a few big investors have already taken their chips off the table. Thiel Macro, tech titan Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, revealed in a regulatory filing late last week that it sold its entire stake in the AI bellwether during the third quarter. The 537,742 shares the firm held heading into the quarter would have been worth approximately $100 million at the end of September. While people may sell assets for all sorts of reasons, Thiel joins a growing list of heavy hitters whose Nvidia (NVDA) moves have lately raised eyebrows on Wall Street. Japanese investment firm SoftBank revealed last week that it sold its entire Nvidia stake in October, raising about $5.8 billion. (Executives said the position was liquidated to fund investments in another AI darling, OpenAI.) Nvidia, which dominates the market for accelerated computing chips, has benefited more concretely from the AI investment boom than nearly any other U.S. company. An increasingly bearish outlook for its stock could spell trouble for more speculative AI bets. Some investors aren't waiting for its next earnings report to make that call. Others have outright bet against Nvidia. Scion Asset Management, run by Michael Burry, the hedge fund manager of “The Big Short” fame, revealed earlier this month that it sold short Nvidia shares valued at $186 million in the third quarter. (Scion also had a short bet against Palantir (PLTR), the data analytics firm Thiel founded in 2003, valued at more than $900 million at the end of the quarter.) Some on Wall Street are increasingly worried that the AI boom is actually an AI bubble. They point to elevated stock valuations, uncertainty about AI's revenue potential, and a series of circular deals between vendors and customers as causes for concern. AI bulls contend that valuations are modest compared with the Dotcom Bubble, to which the current investment cycle is frequently compared, and remind skeptics that AI investment is being driven by hugely profitable tech businesses. The bubble debate has weighed on AI sentiment and stocks heading into one of Wall Street's most important recurring events: Nvidia's quarterly earnings report, scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. High-flying AI stocks like Palantir, Applovin (APP), and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) are among the S&P 500's worst performers over the past week. Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT) fell Tuesday even after they announced a cloud computing deal with startup Anthropic, the kind of tie-up that months ago might have been sure to boost socks. Nvidia shares have fallen more than 10% since late October, when it became the first company in history to be worth $5 trillion. Nonetheless, Wall Street's expectations are still high heading into Wednesday's report, with analysts predicting big tech's aggressive investments will drive a solid quarter for the chipmaker.

Shares of a major home improvement retailer lost ground after it missed quarterly profit forecasts, indicating homeowners are putting off remodeling projects amid economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, strong demand and procedure volumes helped drive a strong earnings report for a medical device company, and its shares advanced. Major U.S. equities indexes dropped for the second straight day ahead of several high-profile earnings reports and the release of delayed jobs data due later this week. The S&P 500 dropped 0.8%, the Dow slid 1.1%, and the Nasdaq lost 1.2%. Click here for more reporting from Investopedia on Tuesday's market moves. Home Depot (HD) stock tumbled 6% to log the worst performance in the S&P 500 after the home improvement retailer missed forecasts with its third-quarter earnings, noting that a lack of storms during the period weighed on its performance. The company also lowered its full-year profit forecast, citing persistent headwinds in the housing market and suggested that homeowners are pushing back remodeling projects amid broader economic uncertainty. Concerns about high valuations for companies in the artificial intelligence space weighed on the tech sector. Shares of Western Digital (WDC), the hard disk drive maker that has drawn attention from investors given its opportunity to help satiate AI's massive data storage needs, fell 5.9% Tuesday. Shares of memory chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) lost 5.6%. Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) shares slipped 4.4% and 2.7%, respectively, as regulators in the European Union announced that they were launching investigations into cloud computing services offered by the two tech giants. The move lower for Microsoft stock also came as the software giant announced a partnership with AI startup Anthropic. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) announced a deal with Anthropic as well. Nvidia shares slid close to 3% Tuesday ahead of the chipmaker's highly anticipated earnings release Wednesday afternoon. Medtronic (MDT) stock advanced about 5% after the medical device maker topped analysts' estimates with its fiscal second-quarter sales and adjusted profit. The manufacturer of pacemakers and other cardiovascular devices also lifted its full-year forecast for organic revenue growth, highlighting strong procedure volumes and a positive demand picture across its end markets. Merck (MRK) announced positive results from a Phase 2 trial of a key heart treatment, and shares of the pharmaceutical company jumped nearly 4%. In the study, Merck's Winrevair met its primary endpoints in helping patients with certain heart conditions reduce pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs.

Nvidia's earnings are in — and Wall Street breathed a collective sigh of relief at better-than-expected revenue and guidance. The stock jumped 3% after hours following the results and ticked higher still during the company's call with analysts. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told analysts. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." The AI chip maker reported revenue of $57 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $55 billion. In its all-important data center unit, revenue was $51 billion versus estimates of $49.31 billion. Earnings-per-share clocked in at $1.30 compared to estimates of $1.26. The firm also topped fourth-quarter sales forecasts, projecting $65.0 billion in revenue compared to estimates of $61.98 billion. CFO Colette Kress reaffirmed that Nvidia is "on track" for "half a trillion" in AI chip orders during the 2025-2026 period, adding that the number could grow as new deals are struck. Discussing the China market, the executive said Nvidia is "disappointed" in the current AI chip export restrictions, which resulted in sizable purchase orders to China not being fulfilled "due to geopolitical issues." The company did not factor in any data center compute revenue from China in its Q4 projection. Nvidia is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments, Kress added. Huang said Blackwell sales are "off the charts" and Nvidia plans to "grow our presence in the US over the next four years." The CEO also talked up recent deals with Anthropic and ongoing partnerships with xAI, OpenAI, and other tech companies, including what he described as "misunderstood" hyperscalers — a category of AI companies including Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — which account for a large chunk of Nvidia's chip business. Scroll on for the full play-by-play from Nvidia's earnings call: Nvidia's stock is trading up around 4.5% after hours as the analyst call ends. Huang says Nvidia is "excellent at every phase of AI," but that inference is "really, really hard." "People think that inference is one shot, and therefore it's easy. Anybody could approach the market that way. But it turns out to be the hardest of all, because thinking, as it turns out, is quite hard," Huang says. The call is wrapping up after about an hour of prepared remarks and the Q&A. "Where are we working right now, in terms of next year, next year there are input prices that are well known in the industries that we need to work through, and our systems are by no means very easy to work with," CFO Kress says. "There are a tremendous amount of components in many different parts of it as we think about that. So we're taking all of that into account." "But we do believe, if we look at working again on cost improvement, cycle time, and mix, that we will work to try and hold at our gross margins in the mid 70s," she adds. The CEO says factors like financing and power aren't "easy," but "they're all solvable." Huang says the chipmaker is "quite confident" in its supply chain. He says the most important thing Nvidia can do is do "a good job planning." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood." Huang says it isn't just hyperscalers like Microsoft and Amazon buying its GPUs, but other companies across various sectors will also adopt them, given the efficiencies they can provide. He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood."

He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." "Moore's Law scaling has really slowed," he adds. "Therefore, a new approach is necessary for them to keep driving the cost down." Huang says that Nvidia's customer base can rely on it because of the "depth and breadth" of its supply chain. "The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says.

"The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says. Huang says when the chipmaker makes forecasts and plans with customers, it's taken seriously because of Nvidia's balance sheet. Huang says that the company will continue to do stock buybacks with respect to investments. He says all of the investments Nvidia has made are associated with expanding the CUDA ecosystem. It appears the rising Nvidia tide is lifting all AI ships. Following Nvidia's earnings report, shares of other AI chipmakers also climbed. Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are up over 7% after hours, AMD shares are up over 6%, and Oracle is up over 5%. "With tensions growing across the Street over the last few weeks as AI bubble fears have grown and put pressure on tech stocks .... tonight the markets and tech stocks got a pop-the-champagne moment with Nvidia's robust earnings and guidance," Ives wrote. "Fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated in our view...this is another validation point for the AI Revolution and, our view, we are in the top of the third inning of this AI game." "Nvidia's supply chain basically includes every technology company in the world," the CEO says. "TSMC and their packaging and our memory vendors and memory partners and all of our system ODMs have done a really good job planning with us, and we were planning for a big year," he adds. The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." "We'll probably be taking more orders," she adds. For example, "Anthropic is also net new," she says, referencing its recent deal, "so there's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced." "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," the Nvidia CEO says. "From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months.

We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months. Overall, Huang unsurprisingly remains a bullish AI optimist. He recently dismissed concerns about AI job displacement by saying that someone was more likely to lose their job to another person using AI than to AI itself. "We are not assuming any data center compute revenue from China in Q4," Kress says, talking about Nvidia's outlook for the current quarter. Kress says the chipmaker remains "focused on building resiliency and redundancy" in its global supply chain. Last month, Nvidia celebrated its first Blackwell wafer produced in the US, she says. "We will continue to work with Foxconn, Wistron, Amcor, spill and others to grow our presence in the US over the next four years," Kress says. OpenAI, Anthropic, Uber, xAI, and others are getting a shoutout. It's been a busy year for Nvidia, which has announced deals, investments, and partnerships with a slew of AI startups and more established companies. Kress says sizable purchase orders to China didn't happen this quarter "due to geopolitical issues" and the competitive market there. She says the company was disappointed it couldn't ship more competitive products to China, but is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments. Shares initially popped 3% immediately following the earnings release, but have risen higher after hours as Nvidia's analyst call progresses. Nvidia says in its 10-Q filing, released Wednesday, that energy capacity could be a potential hurdle for AI adoption. Building energy infrastructure "is a complex, multi-year process that involves significant regulatory, technical, and construction challenges," the company says. In addition to access to capital for certain companies, the company says energy bottlenecks could ultimately "delay customer deployments or reduce the scale of accelerated computing and AI adoption." She says Blackwell's GB 300 surpassed GB 200 and accounted for roughly two-thirds of the total Blackwell revenue. "The transition to GB300 has been seamless," Kress says. CFO Colette Kress said that Nvidia sees hyperscalers like Meta as a major contributor to its future growth. "We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says.

"We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says. Kress adds that Nvidia is helping Meta increase the quality of its services, upping the amount of time people spend on Threads and Facebook. Kress kicks off the call by reiterating Huang's "half a trillion" in AI chip orders number that he previously disclosed. "We currently have visibility to a half a trillion dollars in Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of this year through the end of calendar year 2026," CFO Colette Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress have kicked off the chipmaker's third-quarter earnings call. The executives will begin with prepared remarks before fielding questions from analysts. Huang made headlines at Nvidia's October GTC conference when he said that the company already has $500 billion in chip orders for the combined 2025 and 2026 period, including orders for its Rubin chip. After Nvidia's better-than-expected Q4 revenue guidance, analysts and investors will likely ask for more details about that projection and whether the number has grown. Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, says Nvidia's report indicates that the AI revolution "is nowhere near its peak," both from a market demand and production supply chain perspective. Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies.

Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies. Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne told Business Insider that "Nvidia delivered another blockbuster quarter." However, he said concerns remain about whether Nvidia can meet demand for its AI deployments. "Investors are increasingly focused on whether hyperscalers can actually put this capacity to use fast enough. The question is whether physical bottlenecks in power, land, and grid access will cap how quickly this demand translates into revenue growth through 2026 and beyond," Bourne said. "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out," Jensen Huang says in Nvidia's earnings release. "Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once." Nvidia said it expects to bring in $65.0 billion in the current quarter, which is above analysts' consensus estimate of $61.98 billion. That was a closely watched number, and the better-than-expected result is likely helping propel Nvidia's shares after hours. Third quarter results Is the AI frenzy heating up or cooling down? No company is a stronger measure of that than Nvidia. High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return.

High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return. How much will Nvidia have to overperform to shake those fears off? For the first time, Nvidia established a "deep technology partnership" with Anthropic, committing to invest up to $10 billion in the AI startup. It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia."

It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia." As part of its expanded partnership with Microsoft, the tech giant will also invest up to $5 billion into Anthropic. "We're excited to bring our models as a choice to Microsoft Azure, and Anthropic will be the first model that is available on, you know, all three of the biggest clouds," Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a video announcing the deal. After Huang hyped up the Rubin architecture in Nvidia's last earnings call, the chipmaker unveiled its new Rubin CPX in September. Nvidia said it's a class of GPUs "designed for massive-context inference." Analysts and investors will likely want an update on demand for Rubin CPX, which is expected at the end of 2026. Nvidia announced a partnership with OpenAI in September and shared plans to invest up to $100 billion in building out its data centers. OpenAI plans to construct "at least 10 gigawatts" of AI data centers using Nvidia systems. The companies have said that the first phase of the partnership is "targeted to come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform." Analysts may want an update on the plan's progress. GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: "Investors have begun to worry that GPUs only have useful lives of one or two years, while cloud providers depreciate the value of these assets over five or six years. An accounting mismatch like this could set the AI industry up for a nasty earnings hit in a few years. This view has become almost a consensus on Wall Street now. It's one of the main pieces of evidence for the argument that we're in a huge AI bubble. The problem is that it's wrong: Even as Nvidia rolls out new GPU architectures every 18 months or less, GPUs aren't aging out nearly as fast as some investors fear." Read his full argument here. The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: "No matter where you come out on the AI bubble debate, your next move will boil down to one thing: how long you're willing to wait. If you're an AI bull that believes in the productivity gains that will be unlocked, you might be OK with waiting a long time for that to materialize. Or maybe it's the opposite. You want tangible results now, and that's impacting your investment decisions. AI bears also face a time conundrum: Do they dump positions now and wait for any inevitable storm to pass? That can be risky. As investing legend Jeremy Grantham once told me, on a returns basis, it's just as damaging to sell too early than it is to hit eject too late. So do these bears wait longer and try to time the market more precisely? That can be a stressful and high-risk situation as well. Suddenly, the companies pouring tens of billions into AI — and getting the benefit of the doubt for their efforts — are feeling the heat. The group, which felt unassailable mere weeks ago, is now facing questions from investors: When is this going to start paying off? And do I want to wait around that long?" CFRA Research also expects Nvidia to beat estimates and point to further progress in 2026. In its earnings preview, CFRA forecasts 18% year-over-year growth and 18% quarterly acceleration, the highest since early 2024. It maintains that Nvidia will need to post revenue of $61 billion and EPS of $1.42 for the January quarter, which its analysts think is achievable.

He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist. "We would point towards recent guidance given by management during NVIDIA GTC D.C. that has Blackwell/Rubin generations amounting to $500B of revenue off of 20M GPUs sold with 30% of that already being shipped," Luria stated. Davidson has a $250 price target for Nvidia, valuing the stock at 42 times estimated 2026 earnings and implying a jump of about 39%. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicts that Nvidia's revenue will come in slightly above Wall Street estimates at $56 billion. His team predicts Nvidia's calendar EPS will reach $7.75 per share in 2026 and could go as high as $9.50 per share in 2027. "A big focus of the call will clearly be how quickly all of this AI infrastructure can be installed and any customer concentration risks that may develop."

Title: Nvidia and Microsoft Just Teamed Up For a Massive AI Deal. Is It The Latest Sign of an AI Bubble?

Big artificial intelligence deals aren’t what they used to be. Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday announced a partnership with private AI startup Anthropic that will see the latter buy $30 billion of cloud computing capacity from Microsoft and contract up to 1 gigawatt of additional capacity. The first gigawatt of Anthropic’s commitment will run on Nvidia’s Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. In exchange, Nvidia and Microsoft have agreed to invest up to $10 billion and $5 billion, respectively, in Anthropic. The deal expands a web of entanglements between AI software makers, chip companies and cloud operators that has elicited suspicion on Wall Street. Nvidia has agreed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, which vowed to buy or lease 10 gigawatts worth of Nvidia chips. OpenAI has also committed to acquiring 6 GW of chips from Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which, as part of the deal, awarded OpenAI stock warrants that could give the ChatGPT maker a nearly 10% stake. Nvidia upped its investment in CoreWeave (CRWV) when the cloud computing provider went public in March, and, in September, agreed to buy all of CoreWeave’s excess cloud capacity until 2032. Tech stocks and enthusiasm for AI have propelled the stock market higher for much of the past three years. Those stocks, which now account for a sizable share of the major stock indexes, have struggled lately due to fears about an AI bubble. These and other agreements raised concerns that the AI craze on Wall Street was being fueled by splashy deals that overstate the size of the industry and demand for its services. At the same time, investors have become increasingly concerned that AI revenue won’t compensate big tech companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) for their massive data center investments anytime soon. AI stocks used to skyrocket on deals like the one announced Tuesday, but debates around the AI bubble have weighed on sentiment lately. Shares of Nvidia, which is due to release its quarterly results on Wednesday, were down more than 1% in early-afternoon trading and have lost about 10% of their value since the start of the month. Microsoft stock was recently down 3%, putting it about 9% off its recent record high.

Stock futures are lower Tuesday morning after major indexes fell sharply to open the week; Home Depot reported lower quarterly profits than analysts had expected; Apple's new iPhone 17 gave the smartphone maker its best month of market share in China in three years; Nvidia stock is moving lower again as investors prepare for the chipmaker's results; and buy now, pay later firm Klarna posted its first earnings report since going public in September. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a lower open Tuesday after each of the major indexes lost ground in Monday's trading session. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were recently down 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively, while those connected to the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 0.6% amid ongoing concerns about the possibility of an AI bubble (see more below). Bitcoin was at $91,300, after falling to a seven-month low overnight below $90,000. Gold futures were down 1% at $4,030 an ounce, while crude oil futures fell slightly to just under $60 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects all sorts of consumer loans, was at 4.11% recently, down from 4.13% late Monday. Home Depot (HD) kicked off a busy week of retail earnings Tuesday morning, reporting a 4 cent year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings per share to $3.74, while revenue grew 2.8% to $41.35 billion. Sales topped analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, while adjusted EPS fell short by 10 cents. CEO Ted Decker said the retailer believes its results fell short of its own expectations because of a continuously weak housing market and a lack of severe storms in the quarter, which hampered demand for home improvement products. Shares of Home Depot, a Dow component, were down more than 3% in recent premarket trading. Other major retailers set to report earnings this week include home improvement rival Lowe's (LOW), Target (TGT), TJX Companies (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST), BJ's Wholesale (BJ), Gap (GAP) and Walmart (WMT), which announced a CEO succession plan last week. Apple's (AAPL) newest slate of iPhones, the iPhone 17, appears to be boosting the company's efforts to return to the role of market leader in China. The tech giant saw a 37% increase in smartphone sales in the region in the month of October, according to data from Counterpoint Research reported by Bloomberg, as China's overall smartphone market grew 8% in the month. Apple was responsible for about a quarter of smartphones sold in China in October, the first time it has hit that mark since 2022, per Bloomberg. China is a key market for Apple, but the iPhone maker has been losing ground to domestic competitors in recent years. Apple shares, which hit a record high a week ago, were up slightly in premarket trading. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are losing ground again this morning as investors prepare for the chipmaker's highly anticipated earnings report after the closing bell tomorrow. Investors have been rattled recently by growing questions about whether the artificial intelligence boom has created a bubble in the stock market. The AI-fueled rally has turned Nvidia into the world's most valuable company, as it is the recipient of much of the spending from "hyperscalers" such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META). Nvidia is expected to report rising revenue and profits, though investors and analysts will likely be focused more on CEO Jensen Huang's comments about the outlook for demand. Traders are pricing in the likelihood of a big move in Nvidia shares after the earnings report is released. The stock, which fell nearly 2% on Monday, was down about 1% this morning. Klarna (KLAR), a buy now, pay later company that went public in September, released quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates. Klarna said its revenue grew to $903 million, while it lost $0.25 per share in the quarter, each better than the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Gross monetary value, or the total amount of products bought with Klarna's services, beat estimates at $32.7 billion, as did its number of active users at 114 million. Shares were up slightly in recent premarket trading. Klarna's stock has trended lower since its IPO in September, but analysts have stayed bullish on the stock.

Nvidia is set to report its latest quarterly results after the closing bell Wednesday, with traders expecting a big move in the AI chipmaker's stock. Options pricing suggests traders expect Nvidia (NVDA) shares could move nearly 7% in either direction by the end of the week. A move of that size from Monday's close near $187 could help the shares recover some of their recent losses to return to last week's levels around $199, or pull them down to about $174, a level not seen since September. In recent quarters, Nvidia's earnings have tended to be a sell-the-news event, despite a string of record-breaking results. In all but one of the most-recent four quarters, the chipmaker's stock finished the week lower than its levels heading into the event. With expectations riding high ahead of the earnings, and results from rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other AI favorites indicating investors may be harder to impress this season, Nvidia could face an increasingly difficult bar to clear. This year's big rally in AI stocks, which made Nvidia the world's most valuable public company by market capitalization, has fueled worries about an AI bubble, and investors will be watching closely whether the chipmaker can deliver on its ambitious growth targets. Nvidia's earnings release is the most highly anticipated event of the earnings season, and it's likely to have a big impact on the broader stock market. Nvidia is seen reporting adjusted third-quarter earnings per share of $1.26 on a nearly 60% year-over-year jump in revenue to a record $55.4 billion, according to estimates collected by Visible Alpha. Whisper numbers could be even higher, with analysts from Jefferies and Wedbush telling clients recently that they expect the AI darling to "beat and raise," or top analysts' quarterly projections as well as lift its full-year outlook. Still, Wall Street analysts are widely bullish Nvidia's stock has room to rise after a nearly 40% gain in 2025 so far. All but one of the 13 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha call it a "buy," with their mean target near $219 suggesting roughly 17% upside from Monday's close. Shares of Nvidia slid about 2% Monday amid broader tech sector losses.

Title: Targeting Palantir and Nvidia: Profits, Prophets and Overvalued AI Stocks

Photograph Source: Coolcaesar – CC BY-SA 4.0 In an industry of seedy soothsayers, cocksure charlatans and resourceful rogues, honest and accurate appraisals are exquisitely rare. When it comes to economics, investments and finance, this is particularly so. Certitude, however, tends to be in abundance for those predicting the next financial crash, the sort that will singe earnings and strafe savings. Take, for instance, hedge fund investor Michael Burry, a man of sufficient notoriety to warrant a celluloid depiction of himself by Christian Bale in the 2015 film The Big Short. On that occasion, Burry’s hunch, albeit an educated one, was that the US housing bubble would implode in what became the Great Recession of 2007-9. The buccaneering investor shorted mortgage-backed securities ahead of the collapse, raking in profits as the subprime mortgage sundered. But his record is by no means immaculate, seeing falls when they have not eventuated, especially on tech stocks. For him, the language of catastrophe is never far away. An April 7 post on X this year is fabulously bleak: “Millennials going through 9/11, two economic recessions, a pandemic, the looming threat of WW3, AI job automation, and now facing the ‘biggest crash in history’.” Towards the end of October, he felt in an oracular mood: “Sometimes we see bubbles,” he wrote in another post. “Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.” His Scion Asset Management hedge fund subsequently moved 80% of its US$1.1 billion portfolio to place options against Palantir (PTLR) and Nvidia (NVDA). These will pay handsomely should shares in these AI-linked companies fall. Burry remains convinced that technology stocks, certainly when it comes to artificial intelligence, are overvalued and set for the precipitous plummet. Whether this is due to growing scepticism about the herd-like rush to adopt AI, the debate about necessary regulation, or that broader sensibility that what rises or swells so rapidly must fall or puncture, is impossible to know. Certainly, the incestuous circular financing tech companies have been engaging in is crying out for a stinging correction. But it is precisely moves of this nature by Scion Asset Management that send jitters through the market, turning preaching prophets into market saboteurs. Surely enough, Palantir’s shares fell by 8% on November 4 despite exceeding Wall Street estimates of returns for the third quarter. The stocks had risen to skyscraper levels – 173% for the year heading into trading that day. Nvidia’s fell by 4% after having improved by 50% this year. “It seems fatigue over AI and the current earnings run has investors questioning the sustainability of the AI hype,” reasoned financial analyst Farhan Badami. “That’s dragged down AI companies overnight in markets.” Sympathy for such companies is bound to be in short supply. Palantir is the sort of data analytics company any half-decent minded individual would wish to fail. In April this year, 404 Media revealed that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had paid the company millions of dollars to modify the ICE database to enable it to “complete target analysis of known populations” and spruce up the targeting of that tool and enforcement priorities. The database gives ICM agents the means to sort individuals using hundreds of specific categories covering physical attributes, administrative background and mobility. ICE Director Todd Lyons has fantasies of running the agency’s crude, clumsy deportation policy “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings” in an effort to treat the matter “like a business”. This charming dystopian thought is a good pairing with the sinister propaganda Palantir enjoys promoting, including a campaign on college campuses that echoes the stirrings of a Nuremberg rally cry: “Our culture has fallen into shallow consumerism while abandoning national purpose. Too few in Silicon Valley have asked what ought to be built – and why.” Palantir, to that end, was built to conquer such flabby complacency. “On the factory floor, in the operating room, across the battlefield – we build to dominate.” The company CEO, Alex Karp, has been less than impressed by Burry’s short selling efforts. “The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,” he told CNBC’s Squawk Box in sheer bafflement. “The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is batshit crazy.” He is confident that any damage will be minimal. “I do think this behaviour is egregious and I’m going to be dancing around when it’s proven wrong.” The latest fall is being taken with a grain of salt among some investors, though you can hardly trust them. Take the tepid assessment from equity trading strategist at Citi, Vishal Vivek. “A little bit of risk is not going to take the sheen off what’s been a pretty remarkable year, in fact, a pretty remarkable three-year stretch,” he tells Reuters on whether AI stocks were proving less attractive. “If anything, there’s a reasonable chance that you’re going to pause your buying maybe, but you’re not going to necessarily sell your big positions into year-end because you’re worried about one or two companies that have underperformed.” Leaving aside such babble and bloviation, if there is a crash in overvalued AI stocks likely to rival the market falls that took place in the Great Recession, a similar government program used for the banks and banksters will be sought by Karp and company. In the private sector, foolish losses and unscrupulous conduct regarding investments often turns its members into temporary socialists. Profit, on the hand, is the sort of thing that rests firmly and assuredly in the clasping hands of the corporate sector, the result of purported intelligence and industry. That’s private enterprise for you. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge. He lectures at RMIT University, Melbourne. Email: bkampmark@gmail.com
