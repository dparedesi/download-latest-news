Title: Tesla Missed High Sales Expectations. Will Robotaxi Also Disappoint?

Shares of Tesla (TSLA) slid Wednesday after the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s third-quarter deliveries came in slightly below estimates, underscoring the challenges of the EV market and the burden of high expectations. Tesla delivered 462,890 cars last quarter, a marked improvement over the two prior periods in which deliveries declined on a year-over-year basis. The figures were also just a few hundred vehicles shy of the consensus estimate among analysts, according to FactSet. Tesla will need to maintain its third-quarter sales growth rate (+6.3%) if it’s going to sell as many cars as it did last year. Failure to do so would mark the carmaker’s first full-year sales decline on record. Tesla faces stiff competition, especially in China, the world’s largest auto market, where local manufacturers enjoy the benefits of lower production costs. Chinese giant BYD (BYDDY) sold a record 417,603 passenger vehicles—both electric and hybrid—in September. Tesla has attempted to grow its market share by cutting prices in China repeatedly over the last two years and offering Chinese buyers financing and insurance incentives. Tesla's margins have shrunk in the process. They will be a key focus for investors when the company reports earnings on Oct. 23. Wedbush analysts, in a note on Wednesday, estimated that promotional activity contributed to relatively strong sales in China last quarter. A slowdown in the U.S. and Europe, however, likely offset that strength. Wedbush analysts are confident Tesla can hit the target envisioned by analysts. Overall, they said, the deliveries were “a step in the right direction,” even if they did fall short of Wall Street’s whisper numbers, which Wedbush estimated were between 465,000-470,000. Wall Street's high expectations have been a thorn in the side of the market’s favorite tech stocks in recent months. Nvidia (NVDA) shares tanked in late August after its quarterly results topped analysts’ official estimates but missed their off-the-record forecasts. Google-parent Alphabet's (GOOG; GOOGL) profit also exceeded expectations for last quarter, but the stock tumbled as investors homed in on Youtube advertising revenue, which was slightly below expectations. High expectations heading into major business announcements are invariably reflected in a company's share price. Nvidia stock was up 153% from the start of the year before its disappointing August earnings report, while Alphabet was within 5% of its all-time high. Tesla stock rose more than 20% in September as Wall Street looked ahead to this month’s "robotaxi" event and priced in the benefit of lower interest rates. Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent note advised being "tactically cautious" on the stock because of hype around next week's robotaxi event. After months of speculation about what Tesla could unveil—progress on full self-driving software, a lower-cost model, etc.—"the bar seems quite high and [we] could envision a 'sell the news' type of market reaction." Tesla shares ended down 3.5% at $249.02 Wednesday, putting them back to near where they started 2024. TradingView

Demand for Nvidia's (NVDA) AI chips is "insane," CEO Jensen Huang said in a televised interview Wednesday afternoon. Huang spoke during an interview on CNBC in connection with news of an expanded partnership with IT consulting firm Accenture (ACN) to help companies use artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the companies announced Wednesday. Shares of Nvidia, which closed 1.6% higher Wednesday, have more than doubled in value since the start of the year as companies have raced to buy the company's tech and build out AI infrastructure. Accenture shares moved 1.2% higher Wednesday and have gained about 1.5% in 2024 so far. As part of the deal, Accenture will form a new business group with consultants trained to help clients build custom AI solutions and capabilities with Nvidia’s tech, as well as Meta’s (META) Llama collection of open-source AI models. “This partnership allows us to span a large part of the world’s AI demand," Huang said, adding “this is the beginning of a new wave called enterprise AI.” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives likened Nvidia’s moves to build an ecosystem of partners to those of tech stalwarts Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL), suggesting it could help cement Nvidia’s position in the marketplace.

Title: OpenAI is now worth more than $150 billion

OpenAI’s multibillion-dollar funding round is now complete, giving the artificial intelligence startup a valuation of $157 billion. The $6.6 billion raise is one of the largest private investments ever and puts OpenAI among the top three largest startups with venture backing, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Elon Musk’s SpaceX and ByteDance, which owns TikTok, are the other two. Thrive Capital, led by Joshua Kushner, reportedly led the funding round. Tech behemoths Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) reportedly backed the round, which included investors such as Khosla Ventures, Altimeter Capital, SoftBank (SFTBY), and Abu Dhabi–based MGX. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), which has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its iPhone operating system, recently dropped out of talks to participate in the funding round, the Wall Street Journal reported. The new funding comes amid a spate of executive resignations and reports that OpenAI is spending more than it’s making. The startup’s monthly revenue reached $300 million in August — up 1,700% from the start of 2023, the New York Times reported. The New York Times (NYT) added that OpenAI expects to end the year with $3.7 billion in annual sales, according to financial documents its reporters reviewed. However, the startup also anticipates losing around $5 billion this year due to expenses such as running its AI models and paying employees, according to the review. Next year, OpenAI reportedly expects $11.6 billion in revenue. OpenAI is also reportedly considering restructuring its nonprofit status to attract investors, the Financial Times previously reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. As OpenAI considers a for-profit structure, CEO Sam Altman has reportedly told employees he doesn’t plan to get a “giant equity stake” in the company. In a meeting, both Altman and Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s chief financial officer, told employees the company’s investors are concerned over Altman not having equity, CNBC reported.

Title: A New Month, Another Bout of Stock Market Volatility

It was déja vu on Wall Street Tuesday as stocks slumped at the start of a new month for the third consecutive time, as market participants assessed the escalation of conflict in the Middle East and the possible fallout of U.S. port strikes. The S&P 500, which closed at a record high on Monday to wrap up a strong third quarter, fell 0.9% on Tuesday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended 1.5% lower. Markets were rattled on Tuesday by a massive U.S. dockworker strike that threatens to throw a wrench in domestic supply chains and disrupt economic activity. Dockworkers at East Coast and Gulf Coast ports handling more than 68% of U.S. imports walked off the job Tuesday morning after the expiration of their contract with an industry group representing global shipping companies. Stocks got another shock Tuesday afternoon when Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel, which came soon after Israel launched an incursion in Lebanon and following the killing last week of a Hezbollah leader. The escalations by Israel and Iran sent oil prices soaring more than 5% amid concerns that a deeper conflict could stem the flow of crude out of the Middle East, a major global supplier. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) popped amid the tumult, jumping as much as 24%. Investors flocked to traditional safe havens like gold, which was up nearly 1% Tuesday afternoon, and Treasurys. Tuesday’s volatility resembled both September's and August's in certain ways. Early August’s selloff was sparked by worrisome jobs data and shifting global interest rates. Treasury yields and stocks declined this morning as markets digested data showing a continued hiring slowdown. September’s early rout was led by tech stocks after chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) posted good but not perfect earnings, leading some investors to pull back from richly valued tech stocks. Tech led markets lower on Tuesday, with Nvidia off nearly 4%, and Apple (AAPL) and the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) each down about 3%. Investors will be hoping Tuesday's slump is as short-lived as the last two. Stocks rebounded throughout both August and September to finish out each month at or near record highs.

Title: Treasury Department, Hospitals Among Top Employers Offering A.I.-Related Jobs: Study

Big Tech is undoubtedly leading the pack when it comes to shepherding in the A.I. revolution. But they’re not the only ones hiring talent to help develop the technology—consulting firms, defense companies, health organizations and even government agencies are offering some of the highest numbers of A.I.-related jobs in the U.S., according to a new data study from the computing solutions firm Getac.

You can opt out anytime. It should come as no surprise that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), two of the most dominant tech companies developing A.I., rank at the top of the list with 1,335 and 1,232 A.I.-related jobs available, respectively. The figures were identified by Getac through scraping data across hiring platforms like LinkedIn and Glassdoor. Microsoft had around 228,000 full-time employees as of June, while Meta’s headcount totaled at more than 70,000 during the same time period. Microsoft has bet big on A.I. through multibillion-dollar partnerships with the likes of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and is ramping up to spend even more on the new technology in the future. Its capital expenditures for the April-June quarter, which totaled at $19 billion and marked a 78 percent increase year-over-year, primarily went towards A.I. and cloud-related projects. Meta, which recently released its newest A.I. model Llama 3.2, has also widely adopted the new technology through features like an A.I. assistant that integrated across its platforms and into products like its smart glasses and VR headsets. Other additions on the list, however, are less expected. Coming in at number four was the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which has 417 A.I.-related job postings and has begun incorporating the technology in recent years. The federal agency began using A.I.-powered fraud-detection tools in 2022 and was able to recover a total of $375 million in fraudulent payments in the fiscal year 2023 alone. The department, which has more than 100,000 employees currently, is additionally piloting or using A.I. in a variety of other cases that range from virtual assistant chatbots that can point taxpayers to the correct public websites to a model that could predict how long it will take items to be delivered to target facilities. Trailing behind the Treasury Department is Huntington Ingalls Industries, a defense contractor and military shipbuilding company currently hiring for 363 A.I.-related positions. The company expects its Mission Technologies division, which applies A.I. to build next generation smart defense and intelligence systems, to eventually produce more revenue than its long-dominant shipbuilding sector, CEO Chris Kastner told Defense One last year. Consulting companies, too, have embraced A.I. in rapid fashion. Deloitte, which ranked third on Getac's study with 461 listings, has partnered up with the likes of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon Web Services to help clients and enterprises use generative A.I. Accenture, which came in at number seven with 293 open A.I. jobs, last year pledged to invest more than $3 billion into its data and A.I. practice. Another major investor in the technology is the Georgia Institute of Technology—the only educational institution to make Getac's list with 338 A.I.-related job listings available. In addition to offering graduate programs in both A.I. and machine learning, the school earlier this year collaborated with Nvidia to launch the first A.I. supercomputer designed for student use. "By attracting and developing the best minds in A.I., we can ensure that Georgia Tech not only stays at the forefront of technological advancement, but also aligns its A.I. initiatives with the Institute’s core values of ethics, equity, and transparency," Skye Duckett, the university's vice president and chief human resources officer, told Observer in a statement. In the health field, the Mount Sinai Health System is the dominant player when it comes to applying A.I. with 355 roles open related to the new technology. In addition to using A.I. to detect breast cancer and interpret medical imaging data, Mount Sinai has created several in-house algorithms, "including predictive models to identify patients at risk for clinical deterioration," said the hospital network in a statement to Observer. Besides utilizing A.I. for health care needs, Mount Sinai also expects the technology to revolutionize its software. "Just about every piece" of Mount Sinai software will incorporate A.I. over the next three to five years, said Bruce Darrow, the hospital network's interim chief digital and information officer, in a recent interview with Healthcare IT News. "It's just the way that technology is going," said Darrow, noting that the technology will be helpful across electronic health record systems, emails, presentation documents and video collaborations.

Time Published: 2024-10-01T18:45:23Z
Full Content:
Cerebras Systems, an artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker looking to compete with the biggest tech firms in the industry like Nvidia (NVDA), filed for an initial public offering (IPO) Monday, with the goal of listing on the Nasdaq under the "CBRS" stock ticker. The company, founded in 2016, has spent the last several years designing chips specifically for AI technology. In its prospectus filed Monday, Cerebras said it has worked to answer the question of how it would design chips if it were starting the design process from scratch. The company says that its design process has led it to create a chip substantially larger than those created by competitors, to avoid the complex process of connecting them and to provide greater on-chip memory and bandwidth. In its prospectus, Cerebras reported a $66.6 million net loss for the first six months of 2024 on $136.4 million in total revenue, compared with a wider $77.8 million net loss and $8.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2023, as it said associated costs rose substantially year-over-year with increased production. It listed its competition as chipmakers including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel (INTC), along with Big Tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have begun designing and producing their own AI chips. Cerebras didn't disclose how many shares it intends to offer, or what its IPO price will be, but clearly the potential IPO was announced at a time when companies are looking to capitalize on the market's enthusiasm for the AI industry.

Crypto long positions endure cascading liquidations for the past 24 hours as Iran launches an air strike against Israel. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) crashed in tandem with stock markets on Oct. 1 as tensions continued to escalate in the Middle East after Israel announced ground operations in Lebanon, which has prompted Iran to take action. The official account of Israel Defense Forces on X shared at 4:36 P.M. UTC that Iran was firing rockets at Israeli territory. Additionally, reports claim that Iran is likely to send a second wave of missiles targeting Israel in the ensuing hours. As a result, over $489 million was liquidated over the past 24 hours, with the majority of liquidations — $312 million — occurring within the past four hours, according to Coinglass data. Long liquidations accounted for $416.6 million of the total, while short liquidations amounted to roughly $73 million. According to CryptoSlate data, BTC was trading at $61,598 as of press time, down 3% over the past day. Major altcoins displayed heavier corrections following the news. Ethereum (ETH) was down 4.31% as of press time and trading at $2,490, while Solana (SOL) was down over 5.51% and trading at $146.8.

Jeroen Blokland, founder of the Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, stated on X that investors are “literally selling” BTC to buy gold amid the intensification of the conflict. However, he added that Bitcoin’s average return as a hedge against geopolitical events has proven to be a good decision since 2020. Citing a BlackRock report, Blokland highlighted that BTC outpaced the 60-day returns of SPX and gold during the US-Iran conflict and Covid outbreak in 2020, the deflagration of war between Russia and Ukraine in 2022, and the US banking crisis in 2023.

Title: Forget Tech Volatility: ‘Go Global’ With This Steady 8.1% Payer

Background of international currency notes. Closed-end funds (CEFs), with an average yield of around 8%, are terrific for just about any investor—especially those looking to their portfolios to help pay the bills. Heck, even if you’re not leaning on your CEFs for income, those big payouts are gold—you just reinvest them to boost your portfolio’s value and book an even bigger income stream going forward. But of course, not all CEFs are great investments, with some best avoided unless they trade at big discounts to net asset value, or NAV, the key indicator of value for these funds. And sometimes even a great fund isn’t the best one to buy, despite a big yield and an impressive record. That’s the situation with two CEFs that many income investors love: the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund (ETG) and Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK). Both have their merits, starting with their payouts: ETG yields 8.1% and STK pays a solid 5.6% as I write this. But in today’s market, one fund is clearly the better buy, and it’s all about what lies beneath those dividends. With that in mind, let’s stack these two solid funds up and see how they compare, starting with … ETG makes a splash early in our matchup with a portfolio that’s incredibly well-diversified, with exposure to sectors like financials, consumer staples, energy and, yes, the sector everyone’s talking about today: tech. The fund focuses on resilient large caps like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), pharma giant AstraZeneca SA and Nestle SA, the latter of which is best known for sweets in North America but makes a range of foods and ingredients you’ll find in just about any kitchen. As just those samples from the fund’s top-10 holdings list tell us, ETG also goes beyond the US, where we all know stocks have been on a tear lately, with a bit more than a third of its portfolio overseas. Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Income Fund 2Q2024 fact sheet This level of diversification gives ETG an edge because it spreads risk across the global economy, insulating the fund from the volatility of any single sector or from another big turn in the US stock market. And the roughly 12% of the portfolio in fixed-income investments (mainly investment-grade bonds) adds even more ballast. It helps support that big dividend, too. Now let’s switch over to STK, whose portfolio is in many ways the opposite: Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund June 30, 2024, fact sheet You can clearly see that almost all of the categories in the table above are tech-related. The fund’s top holdings read like a who’s who of the tech elite and include Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research Corp. (LRCX). These are all great companies, but when tech hits a rough patch, STK feels the brunt of it. NVIDIA’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is now over 70, highlights the risk here, reflecting how pricey some of these stocks are. When tech goes up, STK soars—but when tech stumbles, like it has recently, STK’s performance suffers. Then there’s the volatility. Don’t get me wrong. STK has performed strongly over the long term, with a five-year annualized return of 17.6%. But the flipside is clear: This is a high-risk, high-reward play. That’s not ideal for income-focused investors looking for steady, reliable payouts—especially when we look at the price you’ll pay for STK now. As I write this, ETG trades at a 10.4% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), so you can buy its portfolio for quite a bit less than it’s worth. This kind of deal is what we love to see in CEFs—it sets you up for upside and provides a margin of safety in case the market wobbles (since the fund is already cheap, it’s harder for it to get a lot cheaper). In contrast, STK trades at a slight premium to NAV. In other words, you’re paying more for a portfolio of tech stocks that’s already trading at higher prices. With the tech sector well-known for its volatility, paying a premium doesn’t make sense, especially when we can get ETG at a discount and lock in a higher yield at the same time. Over the past decade, ETG has proven itself as a steady performer, delivering a 9.1% annualized return. That’s impressive, especially for a diversified income fund that’s built to withstand the market’s ups and downs. ETG’s ability to provide consistent returns across various sectors gives it an edge when the market gets choppy. And choppiness is very much on the table after 2024’s outsized stock-market gains, especially in the tech sector. This also means STK is like a rollercoaster just at the top of a peak. Sure, its annualized return of 17.6% over the last five years looks fantastic on paper, but that’s largely because it’s been riding the wave of tech’s explosive growth. While STK has a portfolio perfect for those willing to ride the tech waves, ETG is simply the better buy for income investors now. Its 8.1% yield, combined with a double-digit discount to NAV and a diversified portfolio, make it a safer, more consistent play for those of us who prefer to sleep soundly at night while collecting reliable dividends.

Amid a spate of executive resignations and reports that it’s spending more than it’s making, OpenAI is reportedly preparing to close a $6.5 billion funding round that could value the artificial intelligence startup at $150 billion. Thrive Capital is reported to be leading the round, and tech behemoths Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are reportedly involved in talks too. Apple (AAPL), which has a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its iPhone operating system, recently dropped out of talks to participate in the funding round, The Wall Street Journal reported. As OpenAI looks for investors for its multi-billion dollar round, it is also talking to investors about restructuring its non-profit status to attract investors, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. And as it considers a for-profit structure, chief executive Sam Altman has reportedly told employees he doesn’t plan to get a “giant equity stake” in the company. During a meeting with Altman and Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s chief financial officer, both leaders told employees that the company’s investors are concerned over Altman not having equity, CNBC reported. Here are the companies expected to invest in OpenAI’s $6.5 billion funding round. Venture capital firm Thrive Capital is reportedly leading OpenAI’s funding round and investing over $1 billion. Thrive has invested $750 million into the round, and plans to use a special purpose vehicle to add $450 million more from other investors, The New York Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Thrive did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tiger Global, a venture capital firm, is reportedly investing an unclear amount of money into OpenAI. In 2021, Tiger purchased $125 million in shares of OpenAI, The Information reported. The firm was also part of a group of investors that pushed for Altman to be reinstated after he was fired from the startup in November. Tiger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. United Arab Emirates-backed investment fund MGX is reportedly participating in the funding round. MGX, which was launched by the U.A.E. in March to invest in AI projects, hasn’t decided the size of its potential investment, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. G42, a state-backed AI company, and the U.A.E.’s wealth fund, Mubadala Investment, are founding partners of the investment fund. MGX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Khosla Ventures, which has previously invested in OpenAI, is expected to invest in the round through a special purpose vehicle, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Instead of using money from its venture funds, Khosla plans to raise money from limited partners, the people said. Khosla Ventures did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SoftBank (SFTBY) Vision Fund is investing $500 million in the funding round, The Information reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The investment would be the venture capital fund’s largest in a generative AI startup. In July, SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son blocked an investment into French AI startup Mistral to avoid issues with OpenAI, an unnamed person told The Information. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Microsoft, which has already invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, is reportedly in talks to participate in its latest funding round. Microsoft declined to comment. Nvidia, which designs the chips that power some of the world’s most powerful AI models, has discussed investing around $100 million in OpenAI, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Nvidia declined to comment.

Title: Focus On The Data To Avoid Future Bear Traps

Bear and bull in a trap. The stock market was able to rally last week despite the larger-than-expected 0.50% rate cut by the FOMC. As is often the case the averages gyrated after Fed Chair Powell's press conference and higher open the Dow Industrials closed down 293 points. Most will be happy that September is now over as the stock market had a rough start for the month as on September 3rd the S&P 500 gapped 25 points lower and closed down 2.1% while the Nasdaq Composite was down 3.1%. Nvidia Corp (NVDA) was down 9.5%. The selling accelerated for the next three days dropping to a low of 5402.62 which was a decline of 4.3% from the pre-labor day weekend close of 5649, point a. In my view, the drop was due in part to the widespread stock market commentary warning investors and traders of September’s poor seasonal track record. Therefore many were on the sidelines or short when the S&P reversed to the upside on September 11th, point b, in reaction to the CPI report. This I felt “ reflected an important change in the market outlook.” The bullish action of the advance/decline lines set the stage for the upside breakout in the S&P 500 in reaction to the FOMC announcement. My view of investing or trading based on seasonal tendencies was reiterated in 2015. “I have written many times in the past about seasonal tendencies and I have always stressed that one should only invest or trade a seasonal trend when the technical studies are in agreement.” Some investors and traders fail to recognize that comments like “the worst performance of any month” are mostly based on averages. In this case, going back to 1945. The unanimity of the commentary I think led to an oversized short position heading into September. Many who took a bearish bet would be surprised to learn that since 2006 the S&P 500 has had September gains of 2.46%, 3.58%, 3.68% and even up 8.71% in 2010. In fact, over the past seventeen years, it has been higher nine times. Exposure to this data may have kept some from selling their positions or buying puts based on the long-term averages. The lower close after the FOMC announcement had some prepared for heavier selling the next day. Instead, the overnight trading was very positive as the Spyder Trust (SPY Principal Shareholder Yield Index ETF SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ) opened 10 points higher or 100 points higher on the S&P 500. This was likely quite tough for those on the wrong side. Markets The bullish end to the week moved most of the averages higher led by the Dow Jones Transportation Average which was up 2.7%. It was followed by a 1.2% in the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD SPDR Gold Shares ) which was up 1.2% just barely stronger than the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) 1.1% gain. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up 0.6% while the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM iShares Russell 2000 ETF ) was down 0.2%. For the week on the NYSE, 1672 issues were advancing and just 1190 declined. NYSE Composite Monthly The data is still pointing higher as the monthly chart of the NYSE Composite completed a flag formation, lines a and b, in December of 2023. At the time both the NYSE Stocks Only Advance/Decline line and the NYSE All Advance/Decline were above their EMAs and therefore positive. In January of 2024, both advance/decline lines moved through their long-term resistance, lines c and d, which confirmed the positive price action. As we move into October both A/D lines are positive as they are well above their rising EMAs. The widening gap does mean they are getting overbought. In addition to the advance/decline data I also focus on the price and volume data. The price data determines the moving averages and I concentrate on the 20-period exponential moving averages (EMAs) on the monthly, weekly, daily, and even the hourly data. Invesco QQQ Trust The price data is used to determine the pivot levels as well as the starc bands. This weekly chart of the Invesco QQQ Invesco QQQ Trust Trust (QQQ) includes the yearly pivot levels for the past four years. These are based on the prior year's data. From early 2020 until early 2022 QQQ stayed above its pivot. In March 2023, QQQ closed back above the pivot and opened 2024 well above the yearly pivot at $358.78. The weekly Nasdaq 100 Advance/Decline line broke out above the long-term resistance, line b, in November of 2023 (point 3). It has been forming higher highs and higher lows since then as the decline in April 2024 held support before it again surged higher. The weekly relative performance (RS) is one of the key tools I use to determine whether SPY or the QQQ is going to be the best performer. The RS peaked in November 2021 and then dropped sharply. The RS support, line c, was broken in early 2022 (point 1) which indicated that QQQ was now lagging not leading the SPY. The RS downtrend, line d, favored the SPY over the QQQ in 2022. The break of this downtrend and the move above the rising EMA was a sign that QQQ was again leading the SPY. In 2023 the RS stayed above its EMA but it has crossed above and below it several times in 2024. Currently, the RS is below its EMA but rising. If the RS is now able to move back above its EMA that will be a sign that QQQ is again a market leader. Given the global risk factors and the upcoming election, I would not be surprised if there is a sharp 1-3% pullback or two in October. But the strong trend in the advance/decline lines is a positive factor for stocks after the election and into the end of the year. Going forward try to just use hard data in your decision-making process for investing or trading. Avoid making decisions based on any general market commentary, seasonal analysis, or the public investing stance of any large hedge fund. This will help you avoid future bear or bull traps.

Title: SoftBank to Invest $500M in OpenAI for the First Time—Is It Late to the Party?

SoftBank (SFTBF) is looking to invest in OpenAI for the first time. The Japanese conglomerate helmed by billionaire Masayoshi Son has reportedly agreed to chip in $500 million via its second Vision Fund in a round that values the ChatGPT maker at a staggering $150 billion, The Information reported today (Sept. 30). The round is set to be led by Thrive Capital, which is investing $1 billion. Other participants could include Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Tiger Global Management and the United Arab Emirates-backed fund MGX. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. SoftBank’s involvement would represent one of Son’s most significant bets on A.I. so far. It would also follow missteps made by the conglomerate’s first Vision Fund, which infamously backed WeWork and suffered heavy losses after its collapse in 2023. Until now, Son’s most notable A.I. investment has been SoftBank’s majority ownership of Arm, a U.K.-based chip designer. SoftBank in May reported a $4.6 billion gain for its Vision Funds for the fiscal year, largely driven by Arm’s 2023 IPO. In the past few years, the conglomerate has been on “defense mode,” said Son during SoftBank’s 2023 annual shareholder meeting last June. “Three years ago, we didn’t have a lot of cash on hand,” said Son at the time, noting that SoftBank has since amassed more than $35 billion. “We are ready to shift to offense mode,” he declared, adding his primary interest was playing a large role in the “A.I. revolution.” Besides partaking in an investment round for Perplexity AI, an A.I.-driven search engine, earlier this year, the company has largely taken a backseat to A.I. startups and reportedly passed on investments in OpenAI competitors like Mistral AI, Anthropic and Cohere. Its willingness to back OpenAI, however, should come as no surprise—Son has repeatedly sung the praises of the company, stating that he is a “heavy user of ChatGPT” and calling OpenAI CEO Sam Altman “one of the key people on Earth.” SoftBank and OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment from Observer regarding SoftBank’s investment. SoftBank’s bet on OpenAI is quite late by venture capital standards, given its already colossal valuation. But the high-flying A.I. company still has room for growth, according to analysts. The company hit $3.4 billion in annualized revenue in June and is “progressing towards $5 billion in annual recurring revenue, driven primarily by its ChatGPT product,” Brendan Burke, PitchBook’s senior emerging technology analyst, told Observer via email. PitchBook estimates OpenAI is set to benefit from a generative A.I. software market that is on pace to double next year and exceed $30 billion, he added. “This revenue growth supports further valuation growth, which encourages employees to remain at the company and progresses toward the trillion-dollar valuation that CEO Sam Altman believed the company can grow into,” said Burke. SoftBank’s investment comes at a time of uncertainty for OpenAI. The company last week lost three top executives, and Altman is reportedly planning a restructuring that will change the company’s capped-profit model. “Leadership changes are a natural part of companies, especially companies that grow so quickly and are so demanding,” said Altman in a post on X announcing the recent departures.

Title: Nuclear Power Won’t Solve A.I.’s Energy Problem, Says Hedge Fund Mogul David Tepper

With Big Tech locked in an arms race to become the next dominant A.I. player, companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are heralding nuclear power as a solution to the technology’s energy problem. But the hedge fund billionaire David Tepper, founder and president of Appaloosa Management, believes nuclear power simply won’t be enough for A.I.’s development needs. “Some of these projections are crazy,” he told CNBC on Sept. 26. “If you’re going to meet the power needs of what they need for A.I., you’re going to have to use natural gas,” he said.

You can opt out anytime. As the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta spend billions of dollars on building data centers to power A.I. models, they have also sought out ways to offset these data centers’ massive energy consumption. Data centers are expected to double their energy use by the end of the decade and take up 9 percent of the power supply in the U.S., according to the Electric Power Institute. Nuclear power, including the revival of dormant nuclear plants, has emerged as a way to pursue these ambitions without increasing carbon emissions. Microsoft earlier this month signed a power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy, the owner of Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant and the site of a 1979 partial reactor meltdown, in a deal that will reopen one of the site’s two units. And in March, Amazon Web Services struck a $650 million deal with the energy company Talen Energy to acquire a nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania. Despite the tech world’s optimism about nuclear as a carbon-free alternative, Tepper, who is “exploring different parts of the energy side of the tech market,” said there are too many hurdles to cross when it comes to reviving nuclear power. Governors around the country “aren’t going to let their nuclear power come offline—it’s not going to happen, it’s a joke,” Tepper told CNBC. “It will never get by these individual [public utility commissions].” Tepper currently has an estimated net worth of $21.3 billion. His hedge fund is one of the most successful in recent history, having gained a total of $35 billion since its inception in 1993 and $2.7 billion in 2023 alone. Tepper is also the owner of the NFL’s Carolina Panthers team, which he acquired for around $2.2 billion in 2018. Energy consumption isn’t the only aspect of A.I. that Tepper is unsure about. In June, Tepper unloaded more than 80 percent of his stake in Nvidia (NVDA), the chip maker leading the A.I. boom. The move, which reduced his Nvidia holding to around $85 million, was caused by Tepper’s belief that the stock “was too high at the time and would come down.” “Unfortunately, we didn’t buy it when it came back down,” he said. While the billionaire said Nvidia is looking great for 2024 and 2025, he’s less confident about the company’s prospects—and the sustainability of current A.I. hype—in 2026 and 2027. “I just don’t know how you know,” he said. “It’s not my preferred vehicle versus other things that I have more confidence in.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: TikTok's owner is reportedly developing an AI model with Huawei's chips

As the U.S. escalates export controls on China, TikTok’s owner is reportedly planning to use a homegrown chipmaker for an artificial intelligence model it’s developing. ByteDance is planning to build an AI model using chips from Huawei, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed people familiar with the matter. The company wants to use Huawei’s Ascend 910B chips to train the model, the people said. ByteDance has reportedly ordered over 100,000 of Huawei’s chips, but, as of July, has received less than 30,000 of them. One person told Reuters the model under development is expected to be less powerful than ByteDance’s Doubao model, which was released last August. “The entire premise here is wrong,” a spokesperson for ByteDance said in a statement shared with Quartz. “No new AI model is being developed.” Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s Ascend 910B chip is used for less intense AI model inferencing, people told Reuters, but training requires more compute power, and therefore, more advanced chips. And Huawei was reportedly having a hard time increasing production of the Ascend 910B — China’s best alternative to Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips that cannot be sold to Chinese customers under U.S. trade restrictions. The chip fabrication machines Huawei uses to produce the advanced chips are designed for older generations of chips, The Information reported, and repurposing them was causing certain components to break down. Since the U.S. began implementing trade restrictions on advanced chips, including those designed by Nvidia, in 2022, ByteDance has sought chips from Chinese companies, and worked on developing its own. ByteDance has designed two chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) that it plans to mass produce by 2026, The Information reported. The Chinese government, meanwhile, is encouraging tech companies to buy AI chips from local companies, and become less dependent on Nvidia, Bloomberg reported. Nvidia has developed three AI chips for the Chinese market in compliance with export controls, including the H20, which ByteDance has ordered hundreds of thousands of.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is set to undergo a stock split after the market closes on Monday, aligning itself with other prominent AI-driven companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which also executed stock splits earlier this year. Following the split, the stock will begin trading Tuesday at its adjusted—and substantially lower—price. Shortly after the market opened on Monday morning, Super Micro Computer’s shares were priced at $426, reflecting a 1.5% increase. Super Micro Computer’s 10-for-1 stock split is expected to boost demand for the company’s shares. In a stock split, the company increases the number of shares, reducing the share price, but the total dollar value of all shares outstanding remains the same and doesn’t affect the company’s valuation. Super Micro Computer’s 10-for-1 split means that, for each SMCI share an investor owns, they will receive an extra nine after the split is completed. The San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including potential sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following these accusations, Super Micro’s stock price took a significant hit. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course.
