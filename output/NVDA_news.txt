One of the biggest Tesla (TSLA) bulls on Wall Street says it’s time for Elon Musk to change the narrative about his EV maker. With Tesla set to report earnings on Tuesday after the ball amid slumping sales and a cratering stock, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Musk’s latest “turnaround vision” must begin with Musk’s earnings call. Ticking off the slew of setbacks Tesla has faced this year — from becoming “a political symbol” and brand damage to “protests and violence against Tesla dealerships” and new tariffs — Ives said “we are now at a major crossroads for the Tesla story.” “So why stay bullish? It’s a great question,” Ives wrote in a Sunday note. “We believe Tesla along with Nvidia (NVDA) are two of the most disruptive technology companies on the globe over the coming years. The unparalleled innovation, engineering scale, autonomous roadmap, and robotics future will unleash massive valuation upside over the coming years in our view. From earlier this year: Elon Musk is distracted. Tesla stock is cratering. Some investors want a change But Ives also said it’s time for Musk to leave his position in the Trump administration leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Wedbush said Musk faces a “Code Red Situation” if he stays at DOGE. “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,” Ives said. “Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla... and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing... spend some time speaking to car buyers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. You will think differently after those discussions.” “We view this as a fork in the road time,” Ives wrote. “If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage... but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered. If Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow. Wedbush still maintained its Outperform rating on Tesla stock. The shares were down more than 5% in Monday morning trading, and have fallen almost 40% so far this year. Tesla is no longer selling the majority of electric cars registered in America’s biggest electric vehicle market. The automaker has lost significant ground in California, which accounts for almost a third of all zero-emission purchases in the country According to a publication sponsored by the California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA), Tesla’s share of the state’s EV market fell to 43.9% in the first quarter of this year from 55.5% a year ago. Tesla registrations in the first quarter of 2025 fell over 15% from a year earlier — while registrations for all other EVs increased by 35%. Musk was a major supporter of Trump during his presidential campaign and transitioned into becoming a senior White House adviser after Trump’s inauguration. He now leads DOGE, which pushes federal agencies to issue mass layoffs and enact other spending cuts, and has frequently weighed in on foreign politics. Protests have been organized at Tesla showrooms and facilities across the country since Trump was inaugurated in January. Many peaceful demonstrations have taken place, including a slew of protests held on Sunday, such as a 300-person rally held at a Tesla showroom in Boston and another at a showroom in Vancouver, Washington. But more than a dozen violent or destructive acts have been directed at the company’s facilities since the inauguration, according to The Washington Post, including one instance where an individual planted a Molotov cocktail near a vehicle. There have also been several reports of individual vehicles or Superchargers being vandalized. —Shannon Carroll and William Gavin contributed to this article.

Shaken by geopolitical shocks, the S&P 500 was flat last week and the Nasdaq nosed just into the red — but the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished significantly lower, weighed down by a double blow from UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) and Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%). UnitedHealth slashed its full-year forecast after a rough quarter, sending shares tumbling over 20% and dragging the larger index lower. Nvidia also stumbled, dropping nearly 7% after reports of a new U.S. clampdown on AI chip exports to China. Thursday’s further drop pushed Nvidia’s market cap below $2.5 trillion, bringing its total loss to more than $250 billion since the tighter trade restrictions were first disclosed. It wasn’t all red arrows. Hertz (HTZ+3.21%) soared after Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman revealed a sizable stake in the rental car firm — a bullish bet on a company still recovering from post-pandemic headwinds. Eli Lilly (LLY+3.00%) jumped after announcing that its experimental weight-loss pill cleared a key late-stage trial, strengthening its position in the lucrative obesity drug market. Investors now look ahead to a packed week of earnings and economic data, with Tesla (TSLA+1.13%), Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), Lockheed Martin (LMT+0.09%), Boeing (BA+2.21%), AbbVie (ABBV+2.71%), and Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%) all set to report — alongside key releases on PMI, jobless claims, and the Fed’s closely watched Beige Book. Tesla’s results are set to kick things off Tuesday, and the company’s earnings will be one of the most closely watched reports of the week, with signs pointing to a potential tough quarter. Vehicle registrations in California — Tesla’s largest U.S. market — fell more than 15% year-over-year, marking a sixth straight quarterly decline. The company’s share of the state’s EV market also dropped sharply amid growing competition, an aging product lineup, and the controversial public image of CEO Elon Musk. Also on deck: SAP (SAP+0.45%) and Novartis (NVS+1.90%), two European heavyweights that will test investor confidence in multinationals navigating weak demand and shifting interest rate policy. GE Aerospace (GE+2.38%) offers a read on global defense and aviation spending, while Verizon’s (VZ+1.98%) results could reveal whether telecom providers are holding the line on customer growth and capital costs. Other names to watch include Intuitive Surgical (ISRG-0.70%) and Danaher (DHR+2.50%), which will offer clues on whether momentum in medical technology is holding up. Chubb (CB+2.17%) and Lockheed Martin round out the day, with updates from the insurance and defense sectors — both of which tend to attract investors during periods of economic uncertainty. IBM (IBM+1.52%) and AT&T (T+1.94%) will be in focus as bellwethers for enterprise tech and telecom — sectors that have promised stability but face rising pressure to cut costs and defend margins. Boeing also reports, with investors watching for updates on aircraft deliveries and production pace. The company now faces a fresh geopolitical headwind: reports that China has asked its airlines to halt Boeing orders, thrusting the U.S. aerospace giant into the center of escalating trade tensions. While the move won’t impact this quarter’s results, it raises new questions about the strength of Boeing’s international order book and the outlook for global demand. Markets will also be parsing April’s flash PMI data on Wednesday — key readings on both the services and manufacturing sectors, which may reveal whether the economy is cooling fast enough for the Fed’s comfort. Later that day, the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book lands. Published eight times a year, the Beige Book compiles anecdotal reports from businesses across the country, offering a ground-level look at wage pressures, hiring, and consumer demand. It’s less about hard numbers and more about vibes. Alphabet will report earnings under the shadow of a major legal setback. A U.S. federal judge just ruled that the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google’s ad tech business can proceed, rejecting the company’s effort to have it thrown out. The lawsuit, which could ultimately force a breakup of Google’s advertising operations, adds a layer of uncertainty to a business already under pressure. While investors are hoping to see continued AI progress and cost control, shares remain down about 20% this year. Procter & Gamble, Merck (MRK+0.18%), T-Mobile (TMUS+2.22%), and PepsiCo (PEP+1.84%) all report Thursday, too, offering a cross-sector pulse check on consumer spending, pricing power, and healthcare demand. Also reporting: Union Pacific (UNP+1.88%), Gilead (GILD+2.77%), and Comcast (CMCSA+1.99%), bringing updates on freight volumes, drug pipelines, and broadband subscriber trends. You can also expect fresh signals on the health of the labor market and business spending, with jobless claims and durable goods orders both hitting at 8:30 a.m. ET. The numbers could either bolster hopes for rate cuts or cement the Fed’s cautious stance. It’s a fitting end to a high-stakes week: earnings from Charter (CHTR+2.18%), Aon (AON+2.74%), and HCA (HCA+2.17%) will spotlight momentum in media, insurance, and healthcare, while AbbVie, Colgate (CL+1.22%), and a cross-section of energy and services firms round out the picture. Together, they’ll offer a final read on how Q1 really landed — and set the tone for what’s next. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Earnings Season Kicks Into Gear While Tariffs Dominate Markets
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/04/19/earnings-season-kicks-into-gear-while-tariffs-dominate-markets/

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Two of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Tesla (TSLA) on Tuesday and ... More Alphabet (GOOGL) on Thursday. Despite being mired in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 as a group are expected to grow earning at double the pace of the overall market. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Within the S&P 500, 32 companies reported earnings last week, heavily emphasizing bank earnings. Seventy-one percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the first-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 121 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report, marking the second-busiest week of the reporting season. S&P 500 Earnings Season The financial sector contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement, while downward revisions to the technology sector offset the improvement. According to FactSet data, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 6.1% from 4.5%. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 7.2% year-over-year, equal to the expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings and sales growth rates have faded as concerns about earnings and sales have increased due to the increased tariffs. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Tariff worries weighed on stocks with a 1.5% decline last week. After this week’s pullback, the S&P 500 sits 14% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed last week. The group remains in bear market territory at 26.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Returns Much was made of the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rising instead of falling during the tariff-related stock weakness in the previous week. The typical doomsayers came out in force to predict some new apocalypse, but several less frightening factors seemed to be at play. Last week, the 10-year Treasury yield was back to behaving more typically, with yields falling during the stock market weakness. Most of the decline in yields was from a decrease in the real, after-inflation yield demanded by investors, which reversed some of the increase from the previous week. This means investors are demanding less compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Usually, this happens when expectations for economic growth decrease and investors are more interested in safety versus risk assets like stocks during these periods. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Recently, there has also been some gnashing of teeth about the U.S. dollar’s depreciation against other currencies. This caused the alarmists to spread worries about the U.S. dollar falling out of favor as the global reserve currency. Indeed, the tariffs or falling U.S. yields could result in some rebalancing within currency reserves, but any dethroning of the king dollar remains a minuscule probability. The fact is that there is currently no suitable replacement for the U.S. dollar. This does not mean the U.S. should abuse its status, but overwrought concerns are not yet warranted. A longer-term history of the dollar shows that it has been weaker than its current level most of the time since 1999. US Dollar Woes? Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth, a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, and are currently in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow 14.8% year-over-year versus 7.2% for the rest of the S&P 500. The blended earnings growth rate of the S&P 500 excluding the Magnificent 7 is 5.1%. Two of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Tesla (TSLA) on Tuesday and Alphabet (GOOGL) on Thursday. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Beyond the Magnificent 7, the second busiest week of reporting season has a plethora of notable companies scheduled, including 3M (MMM), Boeing (BA), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Procter & Gamble (PG), and PepsiCo (PEP). According to FactSet data, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 6.1% from 4.5%. The healthcare sector is benefiting from easy comparisons for Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which are both expected to swing from losses in the same quarter last year to profits this quarter. The previous losses were due to the accounting treatment of pharma company acquisitions. If these two companies are excluded, the earnings growth rate for healthcare would be 3.6%, according to FactSet. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal gross domestic product growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.3% has slightly undershot expectations. Consistent with the earnings picture, once the distortions from the healthcare sector’s accounting are removed, the technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Sales Growth By Sector With relatively few top-tier economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. Markets remain very attuned to newsflow around the tariffs, since the size and duration of the tariffs should be positively correlated with the extent of economic growth headwind. Actual economic data has remained relatively resilient despite the tariff storm. On the other hand, soft data from surveys shows the reasons for the consternation about the economic outlook. For example, consumer sentiment readings have plunged. While this plunge does not guarantee an impending recession, it points to at least some economic softness if the 2022 period is a proper corollary. Consumer Sentiment Consumer sentiment remains very dependent on the political party of those surveyed. Just as the opposite was the case under President Joe Biden in 2022, Democratic sentiment has plunged relative to Republicans under President Donald Trump. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party This week’s earnings reports should provide insight into additional sectors and two of the Magnificent 7. With the tariff overhang and growing concerns about the resilience of the artificial intelligence wave, forward earnings guidance from management will be watched even more closely. Consensus earnings growth estimates for the calendar year 2025 earnings have been reduced, even though the first quarter's earnings have arrived as expected thus far. Generally, at 14% off their highs, stocks expect these tariffs to be temporary and a passing headwind for earnings. This expectation could be valid, but there could be more downside if elevated tariffs are viewed as more permanent and likely to send the global economy into recession. Upside could come from significant trade deals that lessen the headwinds or a pivot from the administration away from tariffs. The short-term forecast for stocks seems even more impossible to predict than ever, but the long-term outlook is almost certainly not at risk. Stocks have outperformed cash, bonds, and inflation by a wide margin over the long term despite many setbacks, many much scarier than tariffs or recession.

Title: Trump's trade war is spooking first-time investors. 4 need-to-know tips for stock-market newcomers.

Investing your money in the stock market is a great way to grow your wealth in the long term, and the earlier you start, the more time your investments have to compound. While that sounds straightforward, current market conditions might give aspiring investors reason for pause. The S&P 500 is down almost 10% year-to-date as stocks continue to sell off from trade war concerns. Kristen Jauregui made it her goal to start investing this year, but she's been discouraged by the market volatility and has decided to wait until things calm down before buying in. The possibility of investing money into the market and immediately seeing it shrink after another tariff negotiation triggers a sell-off is unappealing to her. "It's something that I had been trying to get involved in because it's time to diversify my assets, it's time to grow my money so I have a better future later on, but with the way that everything is shifting right now, I get anxiety reading the news," Jauregui, a 35-year-old payroll specialist, told Business Insider. Harry Woodland started investing in stocks during the week of April 7, just as tariff news was swinging the market wildly. He began by buying ETFs tracking the global stock market and individual companies like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA), he said. "I'm actually investing a little bit after the tariffs came out, so I'm sort of catching up," the 27-year-old, who runs a landscaping business, told BI. "I definitely have concerns about the whole geopolitical situation. It's a very, very volatile market right now." If you're in a similar boat to Jauregui and Woodland, fear not. Katie Klingensmith, the chief investment strategist at Edelman Financial Engines, has the following advice for those who are looking to dip their toes into investing but aren't sure how to start. The most important thing is having a regular plan, according to Klingensmith. It could be as simple as putting $50 into your portfolio every paycheck, as long as you're following a consistent buying schedule — a practice known as dollar cost averaging where you buy when the market is both up and down. This will create healthy financial habits and help you build up your portfolio at a steady pace, she said. "Even if they're relatively small amounts, over the long term those compound dramatically, so investing a little bit early can make a huge difference over the long run," Klingensmith said. You might be tempted to save up your cash and wait until you have a larger sum to invest, but that's not necessary and might actually be suboptimal. It's hard to time the market correctly and enter at the right point. "If you're systematically buying every paycheck, then sometimes you're going to be buying at the absolute cheapest point, sometimes at a medium point, and sometimes at a more expensive point," Klingensmith said. It's OK to not buy in at the low all the time — dollar cost averaging helps investors smooth out the cost of investing. If it's your first foray into the stock market, stick with the basics, like index funds, ETFs, and blue-chip stocks, Klingensmith said. For those with a longer investing horizon, it makes sense to have a higher risk tolerance as there's more time to weather the ups and downs of the market. Younger investors can often put up to 100% of their portfolio into equities and gradually dial down the risk as they age. Woodland's applying this mindset to his investing strategy and taking some risks on individual stocks while he's young. "The Big Tech stuff in my portfolio does worry me a bit, but it's offset by my recovery period. I've got a long time to invest," Woodland told Business Insider. Steer clear of the more complicated investment vehicles though, Klingensmith warns. "Lots of people are talking about private credit, private debt, or real estate," Klingensmith said. "It doesn't tend to be for the smaller investor because at least at this point, those investments are hard to get into and out of." Examples of index funds that provide broad exposure to the market include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VT), and the iShares MSCI World ETF (URTH). Staying diversified sounds deceptively simple, but it's often hard to heed this tip when the stock market is doing well. For example, if you started investing last year, you might have been tempted to allocate a large portion of your portfolio to Magnificent Seven stocks due to their stellar performance. Now, you might be wishing that you had more exposure to the utilities sector. While it's exciting to invest thematically, such as betting big on the AI trend, that's not the best foundation to base your portfolio on, according to Klingensmith. "The winners within the stock market change. Five years ago nobody would have dreamed that AI would have been this much of a leader in 2024," Klingensmith said. "If you are purchasing a broad basket of securities, you're much more likely to have some winners." Both institutional and retail investors had been betting on US exceptionalism fueling stocks in the last couple of years, but the trade war has proven that the strategy isn't watertight. "Honestly, prior to the tariffs, I would have invested my money into an S&P 500 fund, but I've actually decided to go for the Invesco FTSE All World fund, mainly because I don't really feel comfortable in investing wholly in US stocks," Woodland said. "Now, I understand that the All World fund is around 60% US stocks. However, I do feel like I can sleep better at night knowing that there is the insurance of having international exposure as well." Before you start investing, you should be aware of your risk tolerance, financial goals, and emotions. Whether you like it or not, investing is an inherently emotional experience, Klingensmith cautions. "I can't say enough that all of us, myself absolutely included, are emotional at times like this, and it's hard not to want to sell investments because they've gone down," she said. Her advice? Don't go for more risky investments if you know you can't handle the stress. Define your financial goals and time horizon, and keep a long-term mindset by avoiding checking on your portfolio daily. Klingensmith added that it's not a bad idea to derisk your portfolio and hold more cash at times. Especially during an economic downturn, keeping cash on hand for easy access can be more valuable than investing in the stock market. "It's OK to focus on that cash cushion in the short term, just given the amount of uncertainty that's everywhere, not just in financial markets," Klingensmith said. Jump to

Title: Watch These AMD Price Levels as Stock Slides Amid New U.S. Rules on Chip Exports to China

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares lost ground again Thursday, a day after the chipmaker joined a sector-wide sell-off following news that the U.S. had imposed new licensing requirements on some AI chip exports to China. AMD said via a regulatory filing that the new chip curbs would see it face charges of up to $800 million related to the export of its MI308 graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip designed for compute-intensive applications, such as AI and gaming. AMD shares have tumbled 28% since the start of the year and lost 43% of their value over the past 12 months amid concerns about slowing AI infrastructure spending and the company’s inability to capture a greater share of the AI chip market from sector bellwether Nvidia (NVDA). The Trump administration's trade policies have added to the uncertainty surrounding the stock. Below we analyze AMD’s weekly chart and identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. After breaking down below the neckline of a head and shoulders formation in December, AMD shares trended sharply lower until last week’s volume-backed rebound, potentially laying the groundwork for a longer-term reversal. Importantly, the move created a piercing pattern, a two-day candlestick price pattern that marks a potential reversal from a downward trend to an upward trend. However, selling resumed this week, with the relative strength index (RSI) edging back toward oversold levels to confirm bearish short-term price momentum. Looking ahead, investors should watch for the indicator to potentially break out above a falling wedge pattern it has formed over the past seven months. Let’s locate major support and resistance levels by applying technical analysis to AMD’s chart. AMD shares fell 0.9% to $87.50 on Thursday. The first lower level to watch sits around $76. This area would likely attract significant scrutiny near last week’s low, which also closely aligns with a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to September 2020. Selling below this level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $65. Investors could seek buying opportunities in this location near the December 2022 retracement low, a region the marked the start of a 14-month uptrend in the stock. A move higher from current levels could see the shares initially climb to around $116. This region provides a confluence of selling pressure near the 200-week moving average, last month’s countertrend high, and a range of comparable price points on the chart extending back to August 2021. Finally, a longer-term trend reversal in the stock could fuel a rally to $150. Investors who have accumulated shares during the stock’s downtrend may look for profit-taking opportunities in this location near a horizontal line that connects several minor peaks on the chart between December 2021 and August last year. Depending on the timing of such a move, AMD shares may also encounter resistance in this area from the head and shoulders’ neckline.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Visits Beijing Amid Tightened Chip Export Control

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is walking a delicate line. Like other major tech companies, the chip giant is currying favor with the Trump administration by making massive investments in U.S. infrastructure. At the same time, Nvidia is trying to preserve its lucrative ties to international markets like China, as evidenced by Huang’s latest visit to Beijing. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. A day after Nvidia said it will take a $5.5 billion quarterly hit from new U.S. export license requirements affecting its H20 GPU—designed specifically for the Chinese market—Huang arrived in Beijing today (April 17) to meet with local official and tech leaders, including DeepSeek CEO Wenfeng Liang. During a meeting with Hongbin Ren, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, which invited Huang, the Nvidia CEO expressed hopes for continued cooperation with Beijing and emphasized the importance of China to Nvidia’s business, according to local media reports. The visit comes at a particularly tense moment in U.S.-China relations, as both countries remain locked in an escalating trade war. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump enacted 145 percent tariffs on most Chinese imports, prompting China to respond with a 125 percent levy on American goods. The Trump administration also recently announced new curbs that will require export licenses for semiconductors shipped to China. In an SEC filing this week, Nvidia said the license requirement would cost the company $5.5 billion in additional charges, which will be reflected in its first-quarter earnings report on May 28. In response to earlier restrictions under the Biden administration’s CHIPS Act, which prohibited the sale of advanced semiconductors to China, Nvidia developed the H20 chip to comply with the new rules. Last year, China accounted for approximately 13 percent of Nvidia’s global revenue. The news license requirement will also affect AMD’s MI308 chips and could cost the company up to $800 million. On April 14, Nvidia pledged to invest up to $500 billion over the next four decades to produce chips in the U.S. The Trump administration hailed the announcement as evidence of “the Trump effect in action,” aligning with the President’s agenda to strengthen domestic manufacturing. Other tech giants like OpenAI and Apple (AAPL) have also made similar investments in recent weeks. Huang’s pledge doesn’t mean he has quite given up on China. In addition to his meeting with Ren, he reportedly met with Lifeng He, China’s vice premier for economic policy, who reiterated the country’s openness to foreign investment and trade partnerships. Huang also met with DeepSeek’s Wenfeng Liang to discuss next-generation chip designs that meet U.S. regulatory standards, according to the Financial Times. DeepSeek shook Silicon Valley earlier this year by unveiling a pair of A.I. models that rivaled the performance of leading U.S. systems—despite being developed at a fraction of the cost. The surprise launch prompted renewed calls from American tech leaders for stricter export controls to slow China’s momentum in A.I.

Title: ‘Big Short’ Investor Steve Eisman Derisks, Says Stock Market Volatility Will Be Here for a While

Steve Eisman says he’s taking a wait-and-see approach to the stock market right now. In a new interview with CNBC, the famous investor notes he’s dialed down the risk in his personal portfolio. “I’m waiting. I think we’re going to have volatility for quite a while. The Trump Administration has set up a situation where they’re going to be negotiating with multiple countries on multiple issues. It’s not going to take a couple of weeks, it’s going to take a few months, so I think, for the time being, volatility’s going to be here for a while.” Eisman, who’s known primarily for betting against the housing market prior to the American subprime mortgage crisis, says stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apollo Global Management (APO) have “strong long-term fundamentals” and are primed to make investors money over multi-year timeframes, though he’s less certain about the shorter term. “I would not even hazard a guess as to what any stock will do over the next few months, simply because we’re in the type of market where… there’s only one variable that matters, and right now the variable that matters is the president of the United States, and I can’t handicap that right now.” In terms of NVIDIA specifically, the famed investor says it’s only “the early innings of the AI revolution,” and he predicts the tech giant still has room to grow.

Title: Nvidia has lost $250 billion worth of market cap in almost an instant

Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) stock continues to fall after the company reported that it would take a $5.5 billion hit due to export controls implemented by the Trump administration. After Thursday’s stock drop, Nvidia has lost more than $250 billion in market cap value since Tuesday. The chipmaker’s stock fell by as much as 4% on Thursday after plunging 7% the day before. Nvidia remains the third-largest U.S. company by market cap. On Tuesday night, the company announced the $5.5 billion charge after the U.S. government moved to block exports of its H20 AI chips to China, citing national security risks tied to their potential use. The chips were developed to comply with Biden-era restrictions and had become a key product for Nvidia in China. Jefferies (JEF+2.36%) analysts said in a Wednesday note that the H20 ban was expected — but that the size of it wasn’t. On Thursday, Stifel (SF+3.26%) analysts said they maintain confidence in Nvidia’s long-term growth, even amid these Trump-imposed restrictions. While short-term volatility is a possibility, the analysts said the company’s overall growth trajectory is strong and reliable. Analysts for the investment banking company added that the situation underscores the current global trade war policies and the effect they have on the tech industry. Dutch semiconductor company ASML (ASML+1.37%) reported first-quarter sales slightly below forecasts and flagged the “greater uncertainty” due to trade tensions, warning that new tariffs and restrictions could weigh on its outlook for this year — and next. Stifel analysts noted that Nvidia’s decision to take such a large charge indicates a possible lack of confidence that the necessary export licenses will be granted by the current presidential administration or that no further regulations will be imposed. Still, analysts upheld their “buy” rating and a price target of $180.00 for the company. According to InvestingPro data, Nvidia maintains a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, indicating exceptional financial strength. Meanwhile, the New York Times (NYT+0.29%) reported that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang went to Beijing to meet with Chinese trade officials. According to state media, Huang emphasized his company’s commitment to the foreign market, saying the company would “spare no effort” to build compliant products and “unswervingly serve the Chinese market.” But there could be trouble for Huang back home: The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has launched an investigation into Nvidia’s business in Asia, focusing on whether the company violated export rules, particularly in relation to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. Wedbush Securities said in a note Thursday morning that the chip ban was the “first shots fired” in a potential trade war and said that Nvidia and other U.S. tech companies are “caught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Why New China Chip Export Curbs Could Affect Far More Than Just Nvidia, AMD

Tech losses weighed on the major indexes Thursday, extending yesterday's sell-off amid worries tightening restrictions on exports to China could have wide-reaching impacts. The tech sector led losses on the S&P 500 as shares of Nvidia (NVDA) dropped over 3% in recent trading, making it one of the leading decliners on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock had tumbled close to 7% Wednesday after the chipmaker said it's set to take a $5.5 billion charge due to new export curbs on the sale of its H20 chips to China. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which also warned it would likely take a hit from new China export restrictions, slipped 1%. Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and other semiconductor stocks were lower as well, along with shares of server maker and Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and several other AI hardware makers. (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.) "Rising AI restrictions are likely to impact other key AI-levered computing, networking and optical stocks (AVGO, AMD, MU, ARM, MRVL, COHR, LITE) and raise concerns around enhanced restrictions in other areas," Bank of America analysts said following the news from Nvidia. Like Morgan Stanley analysts, they added Nvidia's write-down indicates a "low probability of future licenses" to circumvent the new restrictions, and that AI diﬀusion rules set to take effect in May could further limit sales of American AI hardware to a broader set of countries. Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Thursday, "We expect hardly any tech companies to give guidance over the next month given this Twilight Zone backdrop. While the Nvidia news is concerning it's not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides before cooler heads prevail and negotiations in some form can begin to play out over the coming weeks/months."

Title: Nvidia's CEO went to China and promised to 'unswervingly serve the Chinese market'

Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) CEO Jensen Huang made a high-profile trip to Beijing this week following a sudden U.S. government move to block exports of the company’s H20 AI chips to China, The New York Times (NYT+0.29%) reported. The H20 — a chip Nvidia specifically designed to comply with earlier export restrictions — had become central to the company’s China strategy. But the policy reversal triggered a projected $5.5 billion revenue hit and a nearly 7% drop in Nvidia’s stock price as of Wednesday. Shares are down nearly 3% on Thursday. While in Beijing, Huang met with Chinese trade officials from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. According to Chinese state media, he emphasized Nvidia’s commitment to the market, saying the company would “spare no effort” to build compliant products and “unswervingly serve the Chinese market.” Back in Washington, however, Nvidia is facing rising scrutiny. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has launched an investigation into Nvidia’s chip sales across Asia, with a focus on whether the company violated export rules — particularly in relation to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which reportedly stockpiled tens of thousands of advanced chips. As Wedbush Securities put it in a note Thursday morning, Nvidia and U.S. tech are now “caught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.” The firm called the chip ban the “first shots fired” in what could become a long and painful trade war between the U.S. and China. Analysts expect tech companies to offer little guidance this quarter, and Wedbush estimates 2025 forecasts will be cut by 7–10%. While the near-term financial damage may be considerable, the strategic risk is even greater. China brought in roughly $17 billion for Nvidia last year — over 19% of its total revenue. If access to that market evaporates, so does a key growth pillar. And with Washington turning up the heat and Beijing watching closely, Huang’s balancing act — between regulatory compliance and global expansion — just got significantly harder.

The Dow sank 527 points Thursday — its worst day in weeks — after UnitedHealth reported a disappointing quarter and slashed its full-year forecast, sending shares tumbling over 20% and dragging the larger index lower. Nvidia also stumbled, dropping 3% after reports of a U.S. clampdown on AI chip exports to China, which sent the stock down 7% on Wednesday. Thursday’s further drop pushed Nvidia’s market cap below $2.5 trillion, bringing its total loss to more than $250 billion since the tighter trade restrictions were first disclosed. But the day wasn’t all doom and gloom. Hertz (HTZ+3.21%) soared after Bill Ackman disclosed a big stake, and Eli Lilly (LLY+3.00%) jumped on strong trial results for its experimental weight-loss pill, a potential blockbuster in the booming obesity drug space. The S&P 500 held flat, the Nasdaq dipped slightly, and small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up nearly 1%. Thursday marks the end of a big earnings week — and with markets closed for Good Friday, investors are bracing for an even heavier slate ahead. Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL+1.23%), IBM (IBM+1.52%), Procter & Gamble (PG+1.60%), and Boeing (BA+2.21%) are all set to report next week, promising insight across just about every sector. U.S. stocks opened unevenly Thursday as Wall Street digested fresh earnings, continuing tension over chips, and fallout from a sharp selloff the day before. The S&P 500 ticked up 0.2%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.13% — a modest bounce after its 3% plunge on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, dropped more than 1%, pulled lower by a staggering 20% drop in UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) stock. The healthcare giant slashed its 2025 profit forecast and missed earnings expectations, spooking investors and weighing heavily on the price-weighted Dow. Nvidia also remained under pressure, down more than 1% in early trading, extending losses after its $5.5 billion charge related to new chip export restrictions to China. The broader tech sector continues to grapple with geopolitical fallout, regulatory uncertainty, and earnings jitters. The Nasdaq remains down about 15% year to date. As the Trump administration sought to blame Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for tariff-related market fallout, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates again Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to 2.25% — its seventh cut in the past year. ECB President Christine Lagarde pointed to rising global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariffs, as a major drag on euro-area growth. “Anybody in this room who thinks that we are in a shock-free world, would I suggest maybe raise their hands or have their head examined either way,” she said. “We are not in a shock-free world, that’s for sure.” Alongside UnitedHealth, Thursday’s earnings slate also included reports from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM-0.94%), Netflix (NFLX+2.09%), American Express (AXP+1.95%), and homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI+1.46%). Wall Street observers leafed through a fresh round of corporate results as they continue to navigate what increasingly feels like a geopolitical storm without a forecast. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or that things are business as usual is eroding. As the market moved toward close yesterday, the major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks. The S&P 500 fell 2.2%, the Dow dropped more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunged over 3%. In individual names, Apple (AAPL+2.21%) fell 3.9%, Tesla (TSLA+1.13%) dropped nearly 5%, and Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) plunged almost 7%. The drop came despite a stronger-than-expected March retail sales report and earnings beats from several blue-chip names, further underscoring just how much markets are being driven by abrupt policy shifts rather than fundamentals. It may all sound abstract — until you consider that Apple, Nvidia, and their peers are among the most widely held stocks in U.S. retirement funds. If you have a 401(k), odds are good you’re along for the ride. On Wednesday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s two-part mission to foster price stability and maximum employment, warned that tariffs are likely to deliver both upward pressure on inflation and drag on growth, and suggested he would not bow to political pressure. Powell’s comments may be particularly relevant because some commentators have speculated that the market selloff may not be a bug but a feature. The theory: By putting pressure on corporate margins and stoking uncertainty, the White House was attempting to engineer the very conditions that would force the Fed to cut rates — and failing that, is now seeking to deflect blame for the economic fallout of its own policies. Then again, attributing coherent strategy to what’s often a chaotic stream of mixed signals, offhand remarks, and rapidly shifting narratives may be a reach. Whether there’s a real plan — or just a series of improvisations with global consequences — is anyone’s guess. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

U.S. stock futures were mixed early Thursday as investors processed another volatile session driven by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s stark remarks on the inflationary risks of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. In premarket trading, the Nasdaq rose 0.6%, S&P 500 futures edged up 0.34%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank 1.5% — pointing to an uneven open amid deepening market anxiety. Here’s what to watch today. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-0.94%) reported a 60% year-over-year increase in first-quarter net profit, reaching T$361.6 billion ($11.12 billion), beating analyst expectations. Robust demand for semiconductors, particularly those used in artificial intelligence applications, from major clients like Apple (AAPL+2.21%) and Nvidia (NVDA+0.54%) drove the surge. UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday, citing higher-than-expected medical costs due to increased outpatient care among older adults. Shares slid a whopping 20% in early trading after the healthcare giant said it now expects adjusted earnings of $27.50 to $28 per share in 2025, down from its previous forecast of $27.50 to $28.50. American Express (AXP+1.95%) reported a 6% increase in first-quarter profit, reaching $2.58 billion, driven by sustained spending from its premium customer base despite economic concerns and new tariff announcements. The company maintained its full-year projections, forecasting revenue growth of 8% to 10% and earnings between $15 and $15.50 per share. But CEO Stephen Squeri noted the guidance remains “subject to the macroeconomic environment.” D.R. Horton (DHI+1.46%) lowered its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to between $33.3 billion and $34.8 billion, down from its previous estimate of $36 billion to $37.5 billion, citing weaker housing demand and affordability concerns. The homebuilder also reduced its projected home closings to 85,000–87,000 units, attributing the slowdown to cautious buyers amid economic uncertainty and high interest rates. Netflix (NFLX+2.09%) reports earnings after the bell. But Wednesday’s sell-off suggests that any sense of stability or business-as-usual may be eroding. The major indexes posted their steepest declines in weeks on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling 2.2%, the Dow dropping more than 700 points, and the Nasdaq plunging over 3%. Apple stock declined 3.9% and Nvidia sank almost 7%. The drop came despite a stronger-than-expected March retail sales report and recent earnings beats from several blue-chip names, further underscoring just how much markets are being driven by abrupt policy shifts rather than fundamentals. It may all sound abstract — until you consider that Apple, Nvidia, and their peers are among the most widely held stocks in U.S. retirement funds. If you have a 401(k), odds are good you’re along for the ride. In a speech Wednesday, Powell reiterated the Fed’s dual mandate to foster price stability and maximum employment, and warned that Trump’s tariffs are likely to deliver both upward pressure on inflation and drag on growth. He also suggested he would not bow to political pressure. Powell’s comments may be extra relevant as some commentators have speculated that the market selloff may not be a bug but a feature. The theory: By putting pressure on corporate margins and stoking uncertainty, the White House was attempting to engineer the very conditions that would force the Fed to cut interest rates — and, failing that, now hopes to deflect blame for the economic fallout from its own policies. Then again, attributing coherent strategy to what’s often a chaotic stream of mixed signals, offhand remarks, and rapidly shifting narratives may be a reach.

TSMC earned $25.77 billion in revenue in Q1 2025 vs. expectations of $25.72 billion. For Q2, the fab giant expects to haul in revenues of between $28.4 billion and $29.2 billion (midpoint at $28.8 billion). Based on its visible H1 run-rate, TSMC is now on course to haul in $109 billion in revenue for FY 2025. — U.S. TARIFFS HAVE NOT IMPACTED CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR; DEMAND CONTINUES TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED SUPPLY. — PRODUCTION YIELDS IN ARIZONA ARE COMPARABLE TO TAIWAN FACILITIES; EXPECTED THAT 30% OF 2NM CAPACITY WILL EVENTUALLY BE BASED IN ARIZONA.$TSM $TSMC https://t.co/zHGRc3jKs6 — Michael Kitara (@MichaelKitara) April 17, 2025 Elsewhere, while conceding to the US tariff-related uncertainties ahead, TSMC says that it has seen no impact on customer behavior so far. As a refresher, NVIDIA and AMD have both disclosed significant financial hits from the Trump administration's recent imposition of licensing requirements on the H20 and MI308 GPUs, respectively. Also, TSMC has declared that the yields in its Arizona fab are now comparable to those in its Taiwan facilities. Moreover, the company now intends to increase its investments in the US to $165 billion. TSMC has no intention of forming joint ventures or engaging in technology sharing with other companies. (@intel) Puts stop to all the rumors. $TSM — Parv sharma (@Parv_S) April 17, 2025 Of course, the most critical comment to come out of TSMC's earnings call was its refusal to enter into any JV or technology transfer agreements with other companies, read Intel. Bear in mind that reports in recent days indicated that Intel and TSMC had apparently reached an understanding to constitute a JV that would then manage Intel's US-based fabs. The arrangement would have also roped in other chip designers such as Qualcomm, NVIDIA, and Apple. For its part, TSMC would have retained a 20 percent stake in the JV, financed via its in-kind contribution of technology and expertise. The Taiwanese fab giant, however, has now clearly denied any possibility of just such an outcome. Citi, of course, has remained skeptical of a JV between TSMC and Intel from the beginning, going on to declare: "We do not believe TSMC operating/forming a JV with Intel would work given differences in manufacturing and operations."

Nvidia (NVDA) shares tumbled nearly 7% Wednesday after the company said it’s set to take a $5.5 billion charge as a result of U.S. restrictions on exports of its AI chips to China. The company said via a regulatory filing that it would be required to have an export license to sell its popular H20 chips to China amid concerns they could be used by Beijing to build a supercomputer. The development caught market watchers off guard, given Nvidia designed the H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) to comply with Biden-era chip export curbs on advanced chips the former administration thought could be used by foreign adversaries. Nvidia shares have staged a modest recovery above this month’s low but have lost about a firth of their value since the start of the year as of Wednesday’s close amid uncertainty over Washington's trade policies and big tech AI spending. Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and apply technical analysis to point out key price levels worth watching out for. After attracting buying interest near the lower trendline of a falling wedge pattern last week, Nvidia shares rallied sharply before running into selling pressure near the pattern’s top trendline. It’s worth noting that although the stock fell sharply in Wednesday’s trading session, the price formed a doji, a candlestick pattern suggesting indecision between buyers and sellers. Let’s identify key support and resistance levels on Nvidia’s chart that investors may be monitoring. Nvidia shares fell 6.9% to close Wednesday's session at $104.49. Further selling in the stock could initially see the price revisit support around $96. This area may attract buyers near last year’s prominent March twin peaks, a location on the chart also situated just above this month’s tariff-driven low. The bulls’ failure to defend the April low could trigger a larger drop to the $76 level. Investors may look for buy-and-hold entry points in this region near last April’s notable swing low. A volume-backed breakout above the falling wedge pattern’s top trendline could drive a move to around $130, currently just above the 200-day moving average. The shares may face overhead resistance in this area near the August peak and December trough. Finally, buying above this level could see Nvidia shares climb to $150. Investors may decide to lock in profits at this price near several peaks that formed on the chart just below the stock’s record high set in early January. This area also aligns with a projected measured move price target that calculates the depth of the falling wedge in points and adds that amount to the pattern’s upper trendline. For instance, adding $40 to $110 forecasts an upside target of $150. The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
