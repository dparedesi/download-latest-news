This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a retailer of high-performance servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, is in a veritable maelstrom at the moment, battling allegations of financial malfeasance, a preliminary DOJ investigation, an audit-related nightmare where the firm has lost its second auditor in around 18 months, and an imminent de-listing from the Nasdaq exchange. Now, a Mizuho analyst is arguing that NVIDIA might not be able to emerge from this saga unscathed, especially as Super Micro Computer constitutes its third-largest customer. Mizuho on $SMCI $NVDA $DELL Klein also warns that SMCI supplier NVIDIA is now at risk of missing guidance if SMCI cannot fund their business as they operate with negative working capital and require a lot of cash and funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid cooling… — Kaushik (@BigBullCap) October 31, 2024 To wit, Mizuho believes that, as an enterprise with a negative working capital paradigm that necessitates extensive external funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid-cooled products "to build multi-million dollar NVL72 Blackwell rack systems," Super Micro Computer might not be able to tap the requisite external liquidity in the coming days, owing to a growing host of risk factors. Should SMCI face a funding deficit, it will have a direct bearing on NVIDIA, which is "now at risk of missing guidance," as per Mizuho's assessment. The analyst goes on to note: "My view is any customer that does not want the risk of missing a deadline or financial target due to issues related to SMCI is going to move their AI server business to another supplier, like DELL." Meanwhile, as noted above, Super Micro Computer's travails are only getting more entrenched. First, Hindenburg Research leveled hard-hitting allegations against Super Micro Computer back in August, asserting that the server provider engaged in distribution channel stuffing by pushing products to distributors based on artificially inflated demand forecasts, undertook partial shipments to meet specific sales targets and inflated its total shipment count in the process, re-hired top executives responsible for "widespread accounting violations" that had resulted in a $17.5 million settlement with the SEC, and paid nearly a billion dollars over the past three years to non-arm's-length suppliers such as Ablecom and Compuware. BREAKING: Super Micro Computer was warned if it fails to provide an audited compliance plan by Nov 16, it will be delisted from the Nasdaq. This news comes 1 day after auditor Ernst & Young resigned. $SMCI is $NVDA's 3rd largest customer & heavy user of $NVDA's vendor financing. https://t.co/SQKE9Oc3zB pic.twitter.com/cBSEFfFVQi — Financelot (@FinanceLancelot) October 31, 2024 In the aftermath, Super Micro Computer delayed the filing of its annual report for the fiscal year that ended on the 30th of June, 2024, presumably in a bid to undertake a comprehensive internal review. Under the prevailing statutory requirements, that report had to be filed by the 30th of August. What's more, SMCI's continuing dilatory tactics have now attracted the wrath of the Nasdaq exchange, which has warned of a potential de-listing action should the firm fail to file the requisite annual report by the 16th of November. What's more, the DOJ has also reportedly launched an investigation into the affairs at Super Micro Computer, with a particular focus on the alleged accounting violations. Elsewhere, as we recently reported, Ernst & Young (EY) sent a letter to Super Micro Computer's audit committee earlier this week, tendering its resignation as the company's officially designated accounting firm: “We are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.” Bear in mind that, with EY's resignation, Super Micro Computer has lost its second auditor in around 18 months. $SMCI said it "disagreed" with the accounting firm's decision and does not expect the "resolution of any matters raised by EY" to result in the restatement of its quarterly reports for fiscal 2024 or prior fiscal years. — NOTRELOAD AI (@thudderwicks) October 30, 2024 Interestingly, throughout this saga, SMCI has continued to profess innocence and has maintained that its annual report for the fiscal year 2024 will not undergo "any material changes." Over the past five trading days, Super Micro Computer shares have recorded a whopping loss of 37 percent.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq led a tumble in US stocks on Thursday after Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Techs amid rising artificial intelligence costs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%, as both indexes ended the month slightly in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also notched a monthly loss after dropping 0.9% on Thursday. The monthly declines snapped five straight months of gains for the S&P 500 and Dow. Optimism for a Big Tech boost to stocks took a knock as investors digested Meta's and Microsoft's quarterly reports. While the results beat Wall Street estimates, both companies flagged that they will step up already high spending on AI infrastructure. Concerns that would put pressure on profitability helped send shares in both Meta and Microsoft lower. The unsettled mood spread to Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which rounded off this week's "Magnificent Seven" earnings with reports after the close on Thursday. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) also fell over 4.5%. After the bell, the mood around Amazon improved, as its stock popped after the tech giant topped Wall Street's estimates for both revenue and earnings per share. Meanwhile, Apple shares slid slightly as a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision weighed on the company's earnings per share. On the macroeconomic front, investors received the latest reading on the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which largely matched expectations. The reading is the last key inflation input for the Federal Reserve before its policy decision next week. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards In jobs-related data, initial jobless claims declined to a five-month low of 216,000, lower than estimates. Next up is the all-important jobs report on Friday. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Apple (AAPL) announced its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, giving Wall Street its first look at whether the company’s Apple Intelligence platform is juicing iPhone sales. For the quarter, Apple saw earnings per share (EPS) of $0.97 on revenue of $94.9 billion. The company says it saw a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision that requires Apple to pay 13 billion euros to Ireland for back taxes. Without the charge, EPS would have come in at $1.64. That would have blown past expectations of $1.59 per share and revenue of $94.3 billion. The company reported EPS of $1.46 on revenue of $89.4 billion during the same period last year. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Intel (INTC) reported its Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday beating expectations on revenue, but falling short on earnings per share due to impairment charges. But positive Q4 guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher by as much as 12% following the report. For the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of $13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read more here. Amazon (AMZN) stock popped as much as 5% after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected. The company also said it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecasted $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said Operating income is expected to be between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall treet had projected $17.49 billion. Read more here. Big Tech led Thursday's losses, with all three averages ending lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) notched a monthly loss, dropping 0.9%. All three averages closed out October slightly in the red. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Tech amid rising artificial intelligence costs, with those stocks losing more than 4% and 6%, respectively. All of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks fell, with Al chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 4.5%. A slew of tech earnings are set to hit the tape again after the bell. Below is what Wall Street is expecting: Amazon: Amazon is expected to report earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Read the full preview. Apple: For the quarter, Wall Street expects Apple to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 on revenue of $94.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Read the full preview. Intel: For the quarter, Intel is expected to report a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read the full preview. Both Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) topped Wall Street's estimates for revenue and earnings per share. But both also talked about ramping up spending on artificial intelligence, which appeared to weigh on sentiment as each stock slumped about 5% on Thursday. Microsoft's capital expenditures picked up to $20 billion in the most recent quarter from $19 billion the quarter prior. CFO Amy Hood said the company is ramping up investments in response to "AI demands." The company did, however, note that the extra spend is weighing on Microsoft's margins. For its part, Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year capital expenditures from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li made a rather ambiguous statement about spending plans moving forward, saying the company expects "significant capital expenditure growth in 2025." The chart below shows a clear trend in growing capital expenditures. The companies say it's going to drive future revenues. For now, the market appears not to love it. But whether it will work in the long run remains a looming question that doesn't have a clear answer. RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote about Microsoft on Thursday, “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions, and would be a buyer on weakness." The October jobs report is expected to show job gains slowed significantly during the month as recent hurricanes and a strike by Boeing workers weigh on the labor market. The monthly report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 105,000 in October while the unemployment rate held flat at 4.1%, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. This would mark the lowest monthly number of job additions since December 2020. In September, the US economy shocked Wall Street by adding 254,000 jobs, well above consensus estimates. The unemployment rate declined to 4.1%. Here are the key numbers Wall Street will be looking at on Friday morning compared to the previous month, according to data from Bloomberg: Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates rose for a fifth straight week as pre-election volatility continued to rock the bond market. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.72% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, up from 6.54% a week earlier. 15-year mortgage rates also increased to 5.99% from 5.71% a week ago. Read more here. Technology stocks led the overall market declines on Thursday. The S&P 500 Technology Sector (XLK) ETF slid 2.8% by mid-session. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) was down more than 4% along with other semiconductor stocks. Among Big Tech's declinersoftware giant Microsoft (MSFT) fell more than 5% following its quarterly results. Social media company Meta (META) fell roughly 4% after indicating it will step up spending on AI infrastructure next year. Amazon (AMZN), set to report earnings after the bell, also dropped more than 3%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its double-digit declines on Thursday as the stock reversed sizable gains from earlier in the week. Shares fell around 15% and trading was briefly halted due to volatility. As Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports, the massive swings come as the stock suffered its largest percent decline on Wednesday after shares plunged around 22%. Since Tuesday, more than $3 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock is still up roughly 130% from its September lows. Read more here. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock dropped nearly 14%, extending declines of 33% in the prior session to erase all of its year-to-date gains, as some Wall Street analysts backed away from covering the stock after accounting firm Ernst & Young resigned during the company's audit. On Thursday, Argus downgraded the server maker to Hold from Buy, with no price target. Meanwhile analysts at Needham and Wells Fargo suspended coverage of the company. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Comcast (CMCSA) said Thursday that it has started exploring spinning off its cable networks into a separate company. The development comes as the media industry undergoes massive disruption, with more consumers cutting the cord, or dropping their pay-TV packages. Comcast stock rose more than 2% on Thursday morning. Read more here. Stocks accelerated their losses on Thursday as the Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropped as much as 2% with technology sliding. Among the biggest laggards, Nvidia (NVDA) sank 4% while Microsoft (MSFT) and Broadcom (AVGO) also fell 4%. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Stellantis (STLA) reported third quarter revenue and shipments that missed estimates, though the company said it's making "progress addressing operational issues." The stock gained more than 3% in early trading on Thursday. Read more here. Tech stocks led the major averages lower on Thursday following quarterly results from social media giant Meta (META) and software maker Microsoft (MSFT). The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped roughly 0.5%. Meta said it would increase capital spending significantly in 2025, while Microsoft's cloud growth forecast disappointed Wall Street as the company races to expand its AI infrastructure. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks sank premarket as investors weighed their hefty artificial intelligence expenditures against the time it will take to generate a return on their investment. Meta fell as much as 4.7% before paring losses, while Microsoft was down 3.6%. During their earnings reports the night before, both companies beat Wall Street’s expectations, but Microsoft’s weaker-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter and Meta’s raised outlook on capital expenditures appeared to spook investors. Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year spending from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li said the company expects “significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.” Microsoft indicated in its fiscal first quarter earnings reports that spending on general artificial intelligence infrastructure (e.g., AI chips) weighed on gross margins, which it expects to continue in the current period. Microsoft justified the spending by saying the demand for its AI products is real and that infrastructure spending is necessary to continue to meet that demand. “Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond,” said Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. Meta said it’s seeing “rapid adoption of Meta AI.” RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria said to buy the dip on Microsoft: “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions.” Analysts also reiterated their Buy ratings on Meta stock. Economic data: Core PCE index, (September); Initial & Continuing jobless claims, (week ending Oct. 26); Employment cost index, (third quarter); Challenger jobs cuts, (October); Personal income & Spending, (September) Earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Conoco Phillips (COP), Estée Lauder (EL), Kellanova (K), Intel (INTC), Mastercard (MA), Norwegian Cruise Lines(NCLH), Peloton (PTON), Merck (MRK), SiriusXM (SIRI), Comcast (CMCSA); Uber (UBER) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Microsoft stock slides as investors weigh earnings Meta beats, but stock falls on heavy spending plans Peloton names former Apple exec as CEO to steer turnaround 'Shadow campaigns': Microsoft-Google legal feud heats up Merck beats Q3 expectations, but China Gardasil sales lag Tesla chipmaker STMicro trims revenue outlook for 3rd time Gold climbs to record amid US election jitters Starbucks (SBUX) shares are indicating a slightly higher open today despite more details about the dreadful quarter the company preannounced last week. And I will tell you why: new CEO Brian Niccol. I have known Niccol for about 10 years, going back to his time leading Taco Bell at Yum! Brands (YUM). One thing among many that I have noticed about him is how he really digs into problems and calmly articulates them — and an action plan — to team members and investors. That was the same Niccol who senior reporter Brooke DiPalma and I encountered last night in a 15-minute post-earnings call phone chat. Such calm under fire will prove to be a good thing for Starbucks, as it has many, many problems to address. Niccol seemingly has more knowledge about Starbucks in his first three months than the prior CEO gained in more than a year! He is wasting no time fixing things at Starbucks, as Brooke reports here. But here is one exchange I had with him on the phone regarding the need to slash the menu size by 25% or more. Cutting the Starbucks menu down is vitally important to driving a better business on the top and bottom lines. It's good to see Niccol understand this (he made it a point to keep the Chipotle (CMG) menu small, carefully introducing a new item or two a year after thorough testing), as his predecessors never did.

Title: Nvidia stock sinks on fears of AI spending slowdown

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell nearly 5% Thursday on investor fears of a slowdown in artificial intelligence spending and potential delivery delays of its AI chips. Semiconductor stocks suffered across the board. The PHLX semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 4%, slumping more than the broader market. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 3%, while Intel dropped 3.5%, Qualcomm (QCOM) sank 2.9%, and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 3.9%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged 8.5%. Microsoft (MSFT), in its earnings report late Wednesday, indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from “third parties” weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software. “Microsoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can’t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,” wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance. Nvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Persistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen. “As long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow … the growth in capex will slow and the revenue growth will increase,” she said. “The pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.” Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), in its third quarter earnings report, said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. “As we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,” said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company’s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be “likely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.” Advanced Micro Devices’ quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well, as the company’s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday. To be sure, Big Tech companies’ AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft’s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google’s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on megacap tech stocks Thursday. Meta said it expects "significant capital expenditure growth in 2025." Nvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 84% to $0.74 and revenue to climb 83% to $33 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Nvidia and other AI stocks are getting dragged down by Microsoft and Meta
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-smci-amd-mu-avgo-ai-stocks-down-microsoft-and-me-1851686429
Time Published: 2024-10-31T17:01:32Z

Despite posting robust quarterly profits, Microsoft (MSFT+0.98%) and Meta (META-0.08%) shares slumped Thursday as both tech giants signaled substantial future AI spending requirements and slower growth prospects. The companies that have emerged as leaders in the AI sector saw their stocks decline despite heavy investments in generative AI that had previously fueled investor optimism. The downward pressure rippled through the broader AI ecosystem, dragging down shares of key semiconductor and hardware providers. Nvidia (NVDA+1.99%) fell 4.5%, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-1.55%) dropped 2.8%, Micron Technology (MU+0.07%) slid 4.4%, and Broadcom (AVGO-0.44%) was down 4.8%. Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer (SMCI-10.53%) faced an even steeper decline, plummeting 15% amid an ongoing dispute with its auditor. The AI hardware company is now at risk of potential delisting from the Nasdaq, adding further uncertainty for investors. In Microsoft’s (MSFT+0.98%) third-quarter earnings report Wednesday evening, it acknowledged that it can’t build data centers fast enough to meet the AI demand. Microsoft’s “inability to build data centres fast enough has constrained its guidance for the coming quarter,” Richard Windsor, founder of Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. During a post-earnings call with analysts, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company has run into external constraints due to high demand for artificial intelligence training and inferencing. “[Data centers] don’t get built overnight,” Nadella said. “Even in Q2 for example, some of the demand issues we have, or rather our ability to fulfill demand is because of, in fact, external third-party stuff that we leased moving up. That’s the constraints we have.” The tech giant’s shares were down over 5% during trading on Thursday, trading at $409 per share. The stock is approaching its worst performance in months, having dropped nearly 2% over the past three months. Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META-0.08%) has invested billions of dollars into artificial intelligence as it looks to keep pace with its Magnificent 7 competitors. The tech giant warned that this spending will only grow into next year and beyond. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg gave analysts a hint of what some of those investments could look like on a call Wednesday but said the company would offer more details once it finalizes its budget in the fourth quarter. “First, it’s clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years,” Zuckerberg said. “So, I think we should invest more there.” “And second, our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there too,” he added. The shares of Meta were down 3.75% on Thursday afternoon. – Britney Nguyen and Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: AI darling Super Micro Computer could get booted off the Nasdaq as the stock plunges another 15%

Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI-10.53%) fell an additional 15% on Thursday, trading at $28 per share, following the resignation of auditor Ernst & Young. Although the server company joined the S&P 500 in March 2024, this year hasn’t been smooth, and now it faces potential delisting from the Nasdaq. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years. Meanwhile, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh has maintained a neutral rating and a $45 stock price target amid concerns over the company’s internal financial controls. The company faced a recent setback when its accountant, Ernst & Young, decided to resign after months of disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. The conflicts between Ernst & Young and Super Micro Computer began in late July, as the auditor raised concerns regarding the company’s internal financial controls, governance, and transparency. In response, Super Micro formed a special board committee to investigate the issues. But Ernst & Young ultimately concluded it could no longer stand behind the company’s financial statements. In its resignation letter, EY said it was “unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management,” citing recent information that allegedly made it impossible to rely on representations from Super Micro’s executives and audit committee. The San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.99%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following these accusations, Super Micro’s stock price took a significant hit. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course. Despite the recent sharp downturn, the firm’s current price remains nearly 13% higher than it was a year ago. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Buy Dell stock on SMCI's auditor woes - analyst

Investing.com --- AI server maker Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) plunged 33% on Wednesday and is down another 12% today after the company disclosed that its registered public accountant Ernst & Young LLP resigned amid an audit of the company fiscal year results. Amid the chaos at SMCI, analysts say another AI server maker stands to benefit – Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL). Dell rose 6% on Wednesday, but Mizuho desk analyst Jordan Klein thinks there is more upside and is now bullish on the stock. “If you are not paying attention to the mess that is SMCI, you should,” Klein said. As a result, the analyst sees material upside for Dell over the next two to three quarters and would remain a buyer on any weakness. “My view is any customer that does not want the risk of missing a deadline or financial target due to issues related to SMCI is going to move their AI server business to another supplier, like DELL,” the analyst added. Klein also warns that SMCI supplier NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is now at risk of missing guidance if SMCI cannot fund their business as they operate with negative working capital and require a lot of cash and funding to purchase large volumes of GPUs and liquid cooling product to build multi-million dollar NVL72 Blackwell rack systems. “NVDA will probably start to move the majority of their GPU supply away from SMCI until they get clarity on the situation,” the analyst states. He said this benefits Dell. With SMCI potentially hamstrung, this “removes a price aggressor on Gen AI server rates systems," according to the analyst. “Dell walked away from large tier one cloud supply agreements over weak margins (they preferred not to lose money on the revenues),” the analyst said. “Their focused on profitable tier 2 cloud customers. But maybe they can go back and WIN TIER 1 CLOUD SERVER DEALS WITH MORE GPU SUPPLY AND LESS PRICING PRESSURE FROM SMCI.” Dell stock is down 3% in early trading Thursday.

Title: AMD still has a gap to close with Nvidia's AI chips
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amd-earnings-q3-2024-ceo-lisa-su-nvidia-ai-chips-2024-10

During Advanced Micro Devices' third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, CEO Lisa Su said the company had "closed a good part of" the gap with Nvidia, its AI rival. But AMD still lags behind Nvidia in the market for GPUs, or graphics processing units, which are heavily used in training AI models because they can process large datasets. Nvidia controls more than 80% of the market. AMD said revenue increased by 18% year over year, primarily because of gains in its data-center segment, including sales of its Instinct GPU and its EPYC CPU. At the same time, analysts raised concerns about a delay in AMD's GPU offerings. This month, AMD said its new-generation MI325X accelerator chip would begin production this year and become widely available in early 2025. It also plans to release its MI350 chip next year to compete with Nvidia's highly anticipated Blackwell chip, which is expected to start shipping in the fourth quarter. Though AMD's performance was about what Wall Street analysts had expected, its stock price dipped by as much as 10% on Wednesday. On the earnings call, Vivek Arya, a Bank of America Securities analyst, described AMD's chips as "kind of one year behind the industry leader." "Can you really gain share until that gap is closed?" he asked. Su responded that AMD's road map had "actually closed a good part of that gap" with Nvidia's products and that AMD held an advantage in data-center retrofitting. "I think MI325 is a great product," Su said. "It's going to compete very well with H200, and the MI350 series will compete very well with Blackwell." When Harsh Kumar, a Piper Sandler semiconductor analyst, asked what was hindering AMD from becoming a bigger player in the GPU market, Su said that acquiring the total addressable market takes time. It can also take years to design and test chips with more processing capacity. "We had an extremely good product even back in the ROM days," Su said. "But it does take time to ensure that there is trust built, there is familiarity with the product." Analysts said that while AMD got a later start in GPUs than Nvidia, it's slowly chipping away at Nvidia's lead in the AI boom. "As much as we still believe NVDA will be hard to shake from its 80-85% AI share, AMD still has done an enviable job from virtually zero to ~5% market share," Arya wrote in a note released on Wednesday. Even if this share remains unchanged, he added, the underlying AI growth will give AMD "the chance to participate." Morgan Stanley also bumped up its estimates of AMD's growth for the next year to $8 billion, though its analysts raised concerns about customer usage. AMD's customers include Microsoft, Meta, and Google. "Our checks continue to show several customers that are committed to using AMD architecture, but actual usage still seems relatively small," Morgan Stanley's equity analysts said. Jump to

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares plunged Wednesday after accounting firm EY resigned as the company's auditor following months of speculation about the company's accounting practices. EY, one of the country's "Big Four" accounting firms, told Super Micro Computer's board the decision comes "due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations." EY added it is "unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management." Super Micro Computer said it disagreed with EY's decision, as the audit it hired EY last year to complete isn't done yet, and that it takes the concerns the accounting firm raised about "whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity" seriously. The resignation comes as Super Micro Computer's stock has tumbled in recent months amid speculation about its accounting practices after it delayed the filing of its annual 10-K and a report from short seller Hindenburg Research alleging "accounting manipulation" and other issues. Last month, reports emerged that the Department of Justice had opened an investigation into Super Micro Computer's accounting practices following the Hindenburg report. Following EY's resignation, Hindenburg founder Nate Anderson said the firm's letter of resignation is "about as strongly worded as I have seen," and suggested EY's decision could make partners like Nvidia (NVDA) question doing business with Super Micro Computer going forward. Super Micro Computer shares were down nearly 30% in early trading Wednesday at $35.71, though even with Wednesday's losses, they've gained about one-quarter of their value since the start of the year.

OpenAI is undoubtedly a winner in the current artificial intelligence boom — and now it’s reportedly developing its own chips to power its growth. The ChatGPT maker is working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+1.25%) and Broadcom (AVGO-0.44%) to make its own in-house AI chips as demand for infrastructure grows, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. It reportedly also is adding Advanced Micro Devices’s (AMD-1.55%) AI chips to diversify supply from Nvidia (NVDA+1.99%). The company has reportedly considered ways to diversify its supply of chips and cut costs, including by raising capital for a network of chipmaking factories. But instead of the plan for foundries — which it has dropped for now — OpenAI is focusing on designing its own chips in-house, Reuters reported. OpenAI’s work with Broadcom on its first in-house chips for AI inferencing has been going on for months, people told Reuters, adding that while demand is currently higher for AI training chips, analysts expect AI inferencing to eventually take the lead. Inferencing, which comes after training, is the process of a trained AI model making predictions from new data. Two people told Reuters that OpenAI is still deciding between either developing or acquiring other features for its AI chip, and could find more chipmaking partners. OpenAI has been able to establish manufacturing capacity with TSMC through its partnership with Broadcom, Reuters reported. The Taiwanese chipmaker reportedly could have OpenAI’s first custom-designed chip by 2026, but that is not certain. Neither OpenAI, TSMC, nor Broadcom immediately responded to a request for comment. In September, OpenAI released a series of “reasoning” AI models that it said are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond.” OpenAI completed a $6.6 billion funding round earlier this month, giving it a valuation of $157 billion.

Eric Beiley, executive managing director of The Beiley Group at Steward Partners, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): It could be a crazy week for earnings. We got tech on deck. What are your expectations? ERIC BEILEY (EB): Expectations are high. The markets are trading near their highs. For the S&P 500, the markets are saying we’ve seen good earnings so far, and then this week is critical, right? You have the big Magnificent Seven names, Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), all reporting. AM: The Mag 7 are all at or near all time highs. They’ve been a part of a big wave of growth. How high can they go? Should investors keep investing in these seven-ish tech names? EB: I would say yes, because they’ve proven over the long term to produce tremendous results for investors, for their shareholders, and they continue to grow. So, and some of them, you could argue the valuations are, are attractive here, but it’s gonna be important to see what their, what their numbers are. Clearly. AM: One of the things that I am sure we’ll get some kind of read on is their spending on AI. Do you think that the market could react badly if investors don’t see a particular result in that spending yet? Or is it too early to tell? EB: No, I think AI is a major long-term powerful trend. You can’t ignore it, right? We’ve seen it. Look at Nvidia (NVDA) now, one of the largest companies in the world as demand for their chips is off the charts. And that’s because of this AI phenomena. And so Meta (META), formerly Facebook, Amazon, they’re all in that business for the long-term, investing billions of dollars. So I think AI is a long-term trend that’s gonna be positive for the markets and investors. AM: Tech is still okay. What other recommendations do you have for investors out there? EB: Well, clearly there’s a lot going on, right? You have this Friday, you have the employment numbers. That’s gonna be very important to see the health of the economy. And that’s gonna dictate where Fed policy goes, expectations are a few more rate hikes. We’re seeing that in the yield curve and that that’s positive for asset classes in general. Lower rates is positive. Then you have the election, clearly, right? That’s gonna be massive. The markets are right now trading based on what the predictions are for the election. So that’s very important. And then after that, you have the Fed meeting to show what their thoughts are. Are they gonna cut rates again? AM: The election. It’s gonna be a thing.Is there a way that investors can prepare for that? Should they sell everything? Should they double down? Like, not to be drastic or dramatic, but what do you think? EB: Well, as a financial advisor, we look for long-term goals to meet my client’s objectives. These are 5, 10, 15, 20-year financial plans we put together. So while this election is massive and very emotional for a lot of people, you have to look at the long-term. You have to look at your own situation and make those decisions. I think traders, we’re seeing it. The trading activity is certainly active right now, predicting whether Harris or Trump wins. You’re seeing right now, in my view, the markets are predicting a Trump victory. You’re seeing certain asset classes doing well that would perform a better in a Trump presidency, AM: Such as? EB: Crypto, number one. Clearly you’re seeing that the media stock for Trump has gone up tremendously in the last just week or so. So that’s showing signs that the markets are leaning toward Trump. AM: What is the market expecting for Friday’s Job number? EB: I think a good number. The markets again are acting extremely well. You’re seeing equity prices continue to go higher. The interesting part of the market now is where the rates, right, the long end of the yield curve, the 10-year treasury yields and longer have really gone up. And that’s predicting that the economy’s gonna stay strong and healthy. And therefore, while we’ll see more rate cuts, [there will be] not as many as predicted. And so Friday’s going to I think we’ll see a strong number and so the Fed will cut rates, but a small reduction and probably pause sometime next year in their cuts. AM: Gotcha. So it sounds like we’re in a good place right now, despite all of the news that’ll be coming out. EB: The trends are very positive and trends are powerful, right? Don’t fight trends, typically, for investors. Right now, the trends are higher and you have good signals out there. You’re having good third quarter results from companies. You have a good economy, rates coming down. All of those are very positive for asset classes in general. AM: Your firm is a fan of something called ‘dividend aristocrats’. Can you tell me about what a dividend aristocrat is and what your picks are? EB: Yeah, well I’m a fan of dividend aristocrats. So these are companies that have proven to be great long term investments because they share their profits with their shareholders. So they are doing that through dividends and they’ve increased their dividend payments every year for 25 consecutive years, which is hard to do, right? Because you think back over 25 years, there’s all types of economic cycles. Companies go through ups and downs and these companies have proven to increase their dividend payouts consecutively. And so I like these companies. There are three, I like Walmart (WMT), S&P Global (SPGI), and Brown and Company, the insurance company. They’ve all outperformed the S&P 500 on a 5- and 10-year basis. So, to me, these are great long-term investments. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Don't Ignore Intel's Near-Term Value Prospects
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/10/29/dont-ignore-intels-near-term-value-prospects/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T16:09:35Z

By Oliver Rodzianko Summary Intel (INTC, Financial) has recently been unfavorable among technology investors, primarily due to its poor results in the second quarter. Management has outlined a significant cost reduction plan in light of this, but past notions that it may leapfrog Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial)—also known as 'TSMC'—in manufacturing capability are no longer viable. Despite this, the stock is selling significantly cheaper than historically, and with Intel likely to deliver strong growth in FY25, I think this is a viable time to buy based on value. In the next 12 months, I see a market cap increase of approximately 50% as likely for the company. However, the longer-term returns seem less promising to me, given how the competitive market in chip design and manufacturing is developing. Operational analysis Firstly, readers need to place Intel’s recent 50% stock price decline into context. The company reported weaker-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, falling short of the GAAP EPS consensus estimate by $0.27 and missing the revenue consensus estimate by $147.82 million. At the time of the report, management announced a $10 billion cost-reduction plan, including cutting 15,000 jobs and suspending dividend payments. This is likely to significantly improve its prospects in 2025, especially as the company exits its peak capital expenditure cycle. Nevertheless, amid these challenges, Qualcomm (QCOM) has suggested it may seek to buy segments of Intel. Currently, Intel is lagging behind its major competitors in data center and AI chips—AMD and NVIDIA (NVDA, Financial)—and is also failing to leapfrog TSMC in semiconductor manufacturing, which was its initial intention with its 18A advanced semiconductor manufacturing node. Now, TSMC has its market-leading 2nm N2 technology in the pipeline, with volume production expected in 2025. With all of this context in mind, it’s clear why Intel’s stock has been performing so poorly recently. However, there are positive developments that fortify the company’s position at its currently depressed valuation. For example, Apollo Global Management (APO) has proposed a $5 billion investment in Intel, signaling confidence in its turnaround strategy. Furthermore, this year’s challenges are likely temporary; my independent perspective is that 2025 will be a much stronger year for the company. While the 18A node may no longer be leapfrogging TSMC, it is expected to launch in 2025, helping Intel regain a competitive position in semiconductor manufacturing. The growth generated from 18A will be significantly supported by the company beginning to capitalize on its in-house manufacturing capabilities. Moreover, Intel’s IDM 2.0 initiative was implemented to enhance its foundry services. The company has heavily invested in fabs in the U.S., Europe, and Malaysia, including a $20 billion investment in two new fabs in Arizona. This is strengthening its global supply chain and increasing its manufacturing capacity. This explains why the company has had such a significant contraction in its free cash flow recently. While there have been challenges thus far in achieving a successful return on investment, as indicated in its second-quarter earnings report, I believe the company is still well-positioned based on a medium- to long-term horizon. Intel Free Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures Chart It’s worth reminding ourselves of management’s long-term strategy here, which reveals why the current depressed stock price could be a value opportunity. With an expansive internal foundry network, the company will have an increased capability to produce the majority of its products in-house. Furthermore, over time, it is likely to become a major provider of foundry services to external customers, including providing advanced process design kits for nodes like 18A. However, none of this changes that TSMC’s moat and market position are still unbeatable—the company currently holds over 60% of the market share in the global semiconductor foundry market. Its market share is therefore several times higher than that of its nearest competitor, Samsung Foundry, which has a market share of approximately 10 to 11%. Intel’s current position is negligible in comparison to these two players. Therefore, investors should not expect high alpha from Intel’s foundry services alone. Valuation and financial analysis Given the real constraints on Intel’s ability to produce lasting high growth in any of its major operating segments due to competition, I believe the value opportunity inherent in the low stock price is currently more appealing as a near-term allocation than a long-term one. The company has been particularly weak in profitability in the last few years, given the extensive operational investments it has been making to support its competitive positioning. Furthermore, its EV-to-revenue ratio has contracted less than its price-to-sales ratio over the past five years, suggesting that the company's net debt position has worsened relative to its market cap. That being said, there is enough total contraction on a revenue and book value basis to support a short-term investment. This is further supported by the fact that in 2025, I estimate the company’s year-over-year earnings growth could be over 300%, given its volume production plans with 18A, exit from its high-investment phase, and in-house manufacturing capabilities reducing costs. Intel Price Valuation Chart On a revenue basis—which I believe is more apt for this investment due to its recent instability in profitability—the company could achieve total revenues of $55.5 billion for full-year FY25, based on my analysis. If its P/S ratio expands to 2.75 over the next 12 months and the market prices these sales into the stock a couple of months early, the company could have a market cap of $152.6 billion. This indicates the potential for a market cap increase of 52% in a year from the current market cap of $100.31 billion. The company’s 10-year median P/S ratio is 2.94, and its 10-year revenue growth rate is 4.7%. Therefore, I believe an expansion to a P/S ratio of 2.75 is more than reasonable—even given the negative sentiment at the moment—considering my estimate of 6% revenue growth in FY25. This is further supported by the consensus that FY25 is likely to be a strong year for Intel on an earnings basis, as I mentioned above. While the market has a valid reason to be skeptical about Intel, I also find it highly unlikely that sentiment will not improve as the company's fundamental growth rates begin to expand. Looking longer term, and given the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry, I don’t think we can expect 6% revenue growth to last. Certainly, 300% or more normalized earnings growth will be a one-off occurrence for FY25. Revenue growth is likely to taper for Intel after a successful ramp-up of its 18A node and the increased demand related to AI at the moment. Moreover, FY25 is likely to be strong because Intel’s upcoming products, such as the Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest chips, are set to leverage the 18A process node, offering improved performance for AI and high-demand applications. In FY26, I expect we could see revenue growth of 5.5% or lower, and in 2027 and beyond, I believe the company will likely achieve a revenue growth rate of approximately 5%. Given that competition from TSMC is so strong, the notion that Intel will be able to maintain a 7% or 8% revenue growth rate over multiple years seems unlikely to me, especially considering the current operational challenges the company has faced in streamlining and efficiency, impacting its profitability. Profitability When looking more closely at Intel’s prospects of generating stable profits, there are certainly concerns currently that ought to be understood when making an allocation. The company’s net margin has declined from over 25% in 2021 to just 1.8% in the recent trailing 12 months. Moreover, this is higher than its operating margin of 0.92% right now, likely a result of tax credits from the CHIPS Act. While the company’s current financial position is concerning, management has prepared for a robust 2025, reinforcing my near-term value thesis. For example, the company plans to deliver over 100 million AI PCs by the end of 2025. The company’s internal foundry model is also expected to deliver savings of $8-10 billion by the end of 2025—this involves Intel’s internal product groups operating in a foundry-style relationship with its manufacturing group. That being said, its foundry business is not expected to generate substantial revenue until 2027, with some revenue anticipated in 2026. This means that its foundry model won't lead to significant growth in the near term, but it is likely to aid in lowering the cost of production for its in-house chips, supporting my near-term value thesis. Intel is targeting significant margin expansion by 2030 through its foundry model and operational improvements, so long-term investors may be rewarded by buying the stock at its current depressed valuation. Currently, Intel looks a little stronger when analyzing it based on EBITDA rather than net or operating income. It currently has $10.08 billion in depreciation and amortization, taking its trailing 12-month EBIT of $1.036 billion to $11.116 billion in EBITDA—that puts its current EBITDA margin at 20.17%. With lower capital expenditures on the horizon after its new fabrication facilities are complete, these should bring down its cost of goods sold, supporting its free cash flow, net income, and EBITDA. That said, I reiterate that there is significant execution risk in this thesis, and if management fails to effectively bring its foundry model to market, I expect further hardship and compounding losses could occur over the long term. Risk analysis Between 2021 and 2025, Intel planned to achieve five processor nodes—Intel 7 and Intel 4 are already in use, Intel 3 is ready for high-volume manufacturing, and Intel 20A is set to debut with Arrow Lake processors, serving as a precursor to the more refined 18A node. Therefore, management is broadly on track, but any challenges in 2025 for full-scale production of 18A could significantly reduce the likelihood of my value thesis being successful. Compounding recent setbacks, Intel recently announced delays in the construction of two major chip-making factories in Germany and Poland, pushing back their completion by approximately two years due to lower-than-expected demand and financial challenges. Additionally, with the $10 billion cost-saving plan outlined in my operational analysis and the reduction of 15,000 positions in its workforce, the financial strain could lead to lower revenues, even if future profitability becomes more secure. Given the rapid advancements in the semiconductor industry led in manufacturing by the highly organized TSMC, any operational setbacks could further exacerbate Intel’s lag behind the leading semiconductor players. This also applies to chip design compared to market leaders AMD and NVIDIA. In the near term, operational failures, lower demand, and technology inadequacies could lead to Intel being a value trap. In the long term, significantly lagging behind its competitors seems a very real and likely outcome. Therefore, these risks should be taken seriously, and allocations should not be outsized, given the potential for future growth inhibitions. Conclusion I’m confident Intel is currently a strong value opportunity, given that FY25 is likely to be a strong year for the company. With my estimate of 6% revenue growth from the full-year 2024 consensus total revenue and my prediction of a moderate expansion in its P/S ratio, the company’s market cap could increase by approximately 50% in a year. However, looking longer term, I believe the competitive pressures from TSMC in manufacturing and AMD and NVIDIA in design will continue to be problematic. Therefore, this value thesis may work better in the near term than over five to 10 years, depending on management’s strategic decisions and execution. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: This 8% Dividend Is The Perfect Buy As Markets Turn Choppy

Old man and the sea, in a rowboat or skiff paddling and fighting the waves of the ocean. I get it if you’re a bit wary of this latest market rally: We’ve got a volatile (to say the least!) election now days away. And while the Fed says rates are headed lower, there’s still a lingering uncertainty about where, exactly, they’ll land. While a bit of anxiety is understandable, we do not want to make the same mistake many “vanilla” investors do at times like these: go all into cash. For one, humans are terrible at predicting the future—remember those warnings of a 100% chance of a recession in 2023?—so safe to say a good number of today’s investment worries are unlikely to come to pass. Worse, for us dividend investors, going to cash carries an extra cost: We lose our income stream. And if you’re in closed-end funds (CEFs), you stand to lose a lot of income indeed: CEFs yield around 8% as I write this, and the portfolio of my CEF Insider service yields even more: around 9.4% as I write this. Just as a fast aside before we go further: One thing that bothers me about the discussion around CEFs these days is that people who don’t know much about them talk about them like they’re speculative investments. Nothing could be further from the truth: Fact is, CEFs are heavily regulated. Just like big companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Home Depot (HD) or Walmart (WMT), CEFs must account for their operations and file statements with the SEC every quarter. Even more reassuringly, most CEFs are managed by big financial institutions, which have a lot of investment resources at their disposal, as well as access to top portfolio-management talent and deep connections in the markets in which their funds operate. So instead of going to cash, we’re taking a pragmatic, dividend-focused (and CEF-focused) approach to the potential volatility ahead: We’re going to: The first thing that jumps out about ADX (besides the dividend yield) is its age: This one has been around since 1929, so it’s weathered the Great Depression, Second World War, soaring rates, falling rates, financial crises, a pandemic, you name it. (I’ve actually heard of some people who pass their holding in ADX down from generation to generation.) Adams has parlayed its long institutional experience into a stellar total return for ADX—nearly 3,500% since late 1988! This is where the fund’s value comes in, because as I write this, ADX trades at an 11.5% discount to NAV, letting us buy in below the value of its assets. (Or 11.5% less than where these stocks trade today, if you were to buy them “direct” yourself.) This discount is a holdover from a few months back, when the fund had a policy of paying most of its dividend as a year-end special payout that could be difficult to predict. Many CEF investors either didn’t understand the payout structure or were too impatient, so they left ADX aside. But management changed that policy and now will pay no less than 2% of NAV per quarter, for an average 8% yield on NAV. That should help ADX’s discount narrow, pulling its price up as it does. And either way, ADX’s policy really amounts to “translating” its portfolio gains into an income stream for you and me. Given the general direction of the market is up over the long term, it’s fair to expect our payouts to rise in the long run, too. Meantime, the fund’s portfolio is extremely modern. Its holdings have a strong tech bent, giving us a chance to buy rapid growers like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) at that 11.5% discount. ADX Portfolio Plus, as you can see, these top holdings also give us a smattering of non-tech names, like Visa (V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The 8% yield means that an investment of $500,000 in ADX would kick out roughly $40,000 of annual income, allowing you to live off dividends while reducing the need to draw down your principal. Here’s another fun fact: While the vast majority of that quadruple-digit return ADX has posted since 1988 was in dividend payouts that were then reinvested, the payout hasn’t hogged the entire spotlight: Shares traded for around $9.75 each back in 1988 and have more than doubled since: They’re around $22 now. So even if you took out all of those dividends and spent them to pay your bills, take vacations, invest elsewhere, whatever—you still saw your original buy double. Not bad!

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AMD (AMD) will report its fiscal third quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, in what will serve as a temperature check on the health of the artificial intelligence market. AI continues to drive shares of tech giants ranging from AMD rival Nvidia (NVDA) to customers like Microsoft (MSFT), and investors and analysts are hoping to see their big bets pay off. AMD’s earnings come less than a month after the company detailed three of its upcoming chips including its 5th Gen AMD EPYC central processing unit (CPU) for servers, its Instinct MI325X AI chip, and the Ryzen AI Pro 300 for AI PCs for enterprise users. Shares of the chip company are up 65% in the last 12 months, beating out the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which is up 36%, and clobbering struggling Intel (INTC), whose stock price is down a staggering 34%. Nvidia, meanwhile, continues to surge, climbing an eye-watering 246% in the last year. AMD is Nvidia’s biggest rival in the AI chip space. Of course, with Nvidia estimated to have between 75% and 90% of the market, that’s not saying much. For the quarter, AMD is expected to bring in adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 on revenue of $6.7 billion, based on analyst consensus estimates from Bloomberg. That’s up from $0.70 per share and $5.8 billion in the same quarter last year. AMD’s data center business segment — its most important — is set to bring in $3.46 billion, up from $1.59 billion in Q3 2023. Analysts are expecting $1.39 billion from its AI/GPU revenue alone. The company’s second-largest segment, its Client business, which involves sales of CPUs for desktops and laptops, is set to bring in $1.71 billion, versus $1.45 billion last year. AMD’s gaming segment, however, is projected to drop in a big way. Analysts anticipate the business will bring in $572 million in the quarter. That’s nearly a $1 billion decline from the same period last year. The gaming segment includes sales of AMD’s Radeon graphics cards for laptops and desktops and custom chips for consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation. Graphics cards for gaming PCs and console sales have fallen since their peak during the pandemic, which saw consumers buying up devices to help them fill their nights and days when they were stuck inside on the couches. AMD’s earnings report will give investors and analysts a look at what to expect from Nvidia when it announces its own earnings on Nov. 20. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

October 28, 2024 12:15 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, Oct. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for one of its ETFs. The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the transaction. Reverse split will be executed on GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF. After the close of the markets on November 01, 2024 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Please note the CUSIP change, effective November 04, 2024: As a result of the reverse split, every twenty-five shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share of the Fund. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above. In addition, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and next day’s opening market price will be approximately twenty-five-times higher for the Fund. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on a split-adjusted basis on November 04, 2024. The next day’s opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for- twenty-five reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-25 Reverse Split Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption. The GraniteShares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. All GraniteShares leveraged and inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions.

Title: Is NVIDIA (NVDA) The Best Performing Large-Cap Stock in the Last 3 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. The past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries’ balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging. The tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end. However, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year. The aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent. Coming back to tech – the industry wouldn’t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown. The US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a Financial Times’ survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed’s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession. For instance, Piper Sandler’s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the “jumbo” rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn’t avert the problem. However, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists’ estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn’t without historical precedent. Further, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week’s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024. Moving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is ‘tactically bullish’ on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets “pricing in a soft landing”. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end. With regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said: “I think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we’re kind of underweight on software.” Rowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don’t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up. For our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 3Y CAGR: 82.08% NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), for all intents and purposes, is considered the driving force behind the AI boom, especially on the hardware side. Nvidia’s core business revolves around designing Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). The company’s biggest market is the gaming industry since GPUs are almost essential for high-performance rendering due to their parallel processing capabilities. As it turns out, GPUs are also incredibly useful for training AI models for the same reason, since AI models require a lot of matrix calculations simultaneously. It goes without saying that Nvidia isn’t the sole GPU designer but what put it at an advantage over its competitors is its proprietary parallel computing platform – CUDA. Having a GPU market share of 70.5% as of 2016, Nvidia recognized the need for a programmable architecture very early since programming parallel processing is recognized as notoriously difficult. The CUDA platform is now supported by a library of thousands of specific applications, which makes it hard to compete with Nvidia in the space of parallel programming platforms. This, coupled with the explosive demand for GPUs for training AI models, resulted in NVDA becoming the most valuable company in the world in June 2024 before Apple regained the top spot for itself. NVDA grew at an annualized rate of 82% over the past three years, and has gained nearly 212% over the past year and 184% year-to-date. Nvidia’s highly anticipated GPU – Blackwell – is expected to offer substantial inference performance gains over its previous GPUs, and is already experiencing a high level of demand from hyperscalers. The GPU will be rolled out in Q4, 2024, but has already been booked out for 12 months. This is what Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein senior analyst, had to say about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in one of the latest CNBC programs: “People are getting excited about the story again as we approach earnings, year-end, and next year when the new platform with Blackwell starts to ramp up. By all indications—based on supply chain checks and everything else—demand for this product looks off the charts.” The analyst believes the stock is trading at a discount: “It’s much cheaper today than it was before the run started a year and a half ago. The stock has risen significantly, but earnings have increased even more than the stock.” Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia has lots riding on this week even as earnings a month out

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. isn’t expected to announce earnings for another month, but results this week from the chipmaker’s biggest customers are about to set the tone for its shares, which are trading near an all-time high on optimism around the AI boom. Most Read from Bloomberg The Tartarian Candidate A Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl Inside NYC’s Playbook for Getting Federal Grant Funds Booming Cambridge Exposes England’s Widening Wealth Gap Robotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. all announce earnings in the coming days. Traders will be paying close attention to their capital spending to gauge demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are prized for artificial intelligence computing. The group accounted for more than 40% of Nvidia’s sales in the second quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Wall Street expects the four tech giants to unveil a record amount of capital expenditures, but any disappointment around the pace of outlays stands to rattle Nvidia shares, which have almost tripled this year, adding more than $2 trillion in market value. It’s likely to be a pivotal stretch for the entire stock market. Nvidia has been the biggest contributor to the S&P 500 Index’s gains this year, accounting for about a quarter of its 22% advance. “If these companies come out and broadly say that capex is increasing even at a modest rate, that’s what Nvidia really needs to keep this momentum going,” said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer at Roundhill Investments. “If anything is poor you could see a lot come out of the stock.” The four tech behemoths are projected to have pumped a combined record $56 billion into capital expenditures in the third quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Much of that spending is going to Nvidia and other makers of AI-related gear, and it’s projected to rise further in the coming quarters. All signs point to continued strength in AI-related spending. From chip equipment maker ASML Holding NV to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., AI has been a bright spot this earnings season. That backdrop has helped propel Nvidia shares, along with reassurances from CEO Jensen Huang that production of its new Blackwell chips is on track and in high demand. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the heavy spending on AI computing equipment. The stock hit a record high last week and its market capitalization is now roughly $3.5 trillion, just shy of Apple Inc., which is still the world’s most valuable company. To be sure, there has been some concern around all the spending on AI by the Big Tech companies, given investors’ perception that the billions of dollars the firms have invested has generated relatively little in revenue. So that will be another focus as the cohort announces earnings this week. “You’ve got to walk that fine line of investment,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, so that investors see you’re “not getting too far ahead of yourself.” Nvidia’s revenue is projected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, sales are estimated to increase 44% to $181 billion, in the chipmaker’s fiscal 2026. Of course, there are other beneficiaries of high AI spending for which this week will be important to watch, including Broadcom Inc., Super Micro Computer Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. Top Tech Stories Indonesia blocked Apple Inc. from selling its latest iPhones in Southeast Asia’s largest economy, saying the company has yet to meet local investment requirements. When Meg Whitman was living in California and running first eBay Inc. and then HP Inc., the idea that Africa had some role to play in her businesses rarely crossed her mind. “I literally thought about Africa 1% of my time,” she says. Olympus Corp. pushed out its chief executive officer after investigating an allegation he purchased illegal drugs, a stunning exit for the German native after less than two years at the helm. Hong Kong outlined its first policy guidelines dedicated to the use of AI in finance and floated a tax break for virtual assets, part of efforts to promote itself as an Asian business center.

Title: Bitcoin is better than gold — even as gold hits record highs. Here's why
URL: https://qz.com/bitcoin-gold-price-record-investment-bitwise-1851680456
Time Published: 2024-10-28T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Gold prices have soared to new heights, reaching a record $2,733 per ounce, while Bitcoin is thriving, approaching the $70,000 mark. The rally has been fueled by increased investor demand for safe-haven assets amid the Fed’s rate cuts, China’s stimulus plan, and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. This has reignited the debate over which asset makes for a better investment: gold or Bitcoin. Bitwise Asset Management, a firm specializing in crypto index funds and ETFs, views Bitcoin and gold as assets with distinct advantages. In an interview with Quartz, Matthew Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, explained that while Bitcoin has the potential for higher returns, gold offers greater stability. He emphasized that Bitcoin holds more advantages over gold, particularly in terms of growth potential and long-term utility. Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold” because it shares several key characteristics with the precious metal. Like gold, Bitcoin has a finite supply as only 21 million coins will ever be mined, creating a built-in scarcity that many believe will drive its value higher over time. This limited supply introduces a deflationary element, contrasting with traditional fiat currencies that can be printed at will. Additionally, both Bitcoin and gold are decentralized assets. This means they operate independently of central banks or governmental control, making them less susceptible to policy-driven fluctuations. Investors see this as a hedge against economic instability, particularly during times of inflation or market volatility. Consequently, both assets are often viewed as safe havens, providing a store of value when traditional markets experience downturns. Despite the striking similarities between Bitcoin and gold, there are also significant differences, one of which is price volatility. Bitcoin tends to experience far more dramatic price fluctuations than gold, sometimes within a single day. According to Hougan, the role of Bitcoin in an investment portfolio differs fundamentally from that of gold. While both assets can serve as hedges, Bitcoin’s higher volatility means it can amplify gains or losses, making it more suitable for investors willing to take on risk for potentially higher rewards. In contrast, gold’s stability offers a more conservative approach, providing steady protection against economic uncertainties. “When you add Bitcoin to a portfolio, it boosts returns without increasing risk, and when you add gold to a portfolio, you get the same return but less risk,” he told Quartz. Hougan pointed out that, despite their similarities and differences, gold and Bitcoin do not have the same impact on an investment portfolio. He used a vivid analogy to illustrate this, comparing the two assets to ingredients in a soup. Adding gold to a portfolio, he explained, is like adding water to a soup—it doesn’t alter the flavor significantly unless a substantial amount is added. Gold’s stability and gradual influence mean it acts as a steadying force, but its effect is subtle unless it forms a large part of the investment mix. In contrast, Hougan likened adding Bitcoin to a portfolio to adding pepper to a soup; even a small amount can make a noticeable difference. Due to its higher volatility and growth potential, Bitcoin can have a pronounced impact on portfolio performance, amplifying returns but also introducing greater risk. This analogy underscores how Bitcoin, despite its smaller allocation, can play a more dynamic and immediate role in an investor’s strategy. In his analysis, Matthew Hougan referenced data from Bitwise that demonstrated how even a modest allocation of Bitcoin—such as 1.0%, 2.5%, or 5.0%—to a traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio could significantly enhance returns while only marginally increasing risk. For instance, a 2.5% allocation to Bitcoin was shown to improve overall portfolio returns by as much as 50 percentage points, with only a slight uptick in volatility. This suggests that Bitcoin’s potential for high growth can meaningfully boost portfolio performance, even at low levels of exposure. In contrast, Hougan explained that gold had a more subtle impact on returns. While it did not contribute as much to boosting gains, gold played a key role in reducing overall portfolio risk, acting as a stabilizing asset during periods of economic uncertainty. This distinction highlights the different roles these assets can play within a diversified investment strategy—Bitcoin as a high-growth, higher-risk element, and gold as a steady, risk-mitigating component. Over the past 30 years, more than 5,000 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been launched across various sectors, but Bitcoin ETFs have outpaced them all, including the highly successful gold ETFs. Following SEC approval and their subsequent debut in January 2024, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $21 billion in total net flows, a remarkable achievement considering the typical challenges faced by new ETFs. By comparison, it took gold ETFs around five years to reach the same level of net inflows. Hougan agreed, stating that Bitcoin is a more effective addition to a portfolio than gold for achieving the goals most investors seek. This year, in addition to Bitcoin ETFs, Ether ETFs also received approval from the SEC, raising the likelihood that other crypto ETFs, such as those for XRP and Solana, could soon follow. At the launch of Ether ETFs, Hougan predicted that these exchange-traded products would have an even greater impact on Ethereum than they did on Bitcoin. He noted that the introduction of Ether ETFs could drive up the price of Ether, potentially pushing it beyond the $5,000 mark. He told Quartz that if Bitcoin is like digital gold, Ether is like a tech play, and it belongs in the Nasdaq 100 effectively, like Apple (AAPL-1.28%), Nvidia (NVDA+1.99%), Microsoft (MSFT+0.98%), and others. Like these tech giants, Ether is driven by innovation and utility, given its role as the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. “If you’re a tech investor and you don’t have Ethereum, you’re missing out,” he said. “It’d be like a tech investor not owning Nvidia.” Hougan emphasized the significance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, by noting the recent trends in both Bitcoin and gold prices. He pointed out that Bitcoin is approaching its all-time high, while gold has already reached its peak, signaling growing concerns among investors about the stability of traditional fiat currencies and broader economic uncertainties. According to Hougan, this trend underscores a shift in investor sentiment: Bitcoin offers the potential for higher returns, making it an attractive option for those seeking growth, while gold remains a go-to asset for those prioritizing stability and preservation of wealth. The choice between the two ultimately comes down to an investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Those willing to accept higher volatility for the possibility of greater rewards may lean towards Bitcoin, while more conservative investors might prefer the steady, time-tested security of gold. “Keep your stocks, keep your bonds, but carve out a little space for this new asset [Bitcoin] that provides unique enhancements to your portfolio and has, in our view, significant upside potential,” he added.

This limited supply introduces a deflationary element, contrasting with traditional fiat currencies that can be printed at will. Additionally, both Bitcoin and gold are decentralized assets. This means they operate independently of central banks or governmental control, making them less susceptible to policy-driven fluctuations. Investors see this as a hedge against economic instability, particularly during times of inflation or market volatility. Consequently, both assets are often viewed as safe havens, providing a store of value when traditional markets experience downturns. Despite the striking similarities between Bitcoin and gold, there are also significant differences, one of which is price volatility. Bitcoin tends to experience far more dramatic price fluctuations than gold, sometimes within a single day. According to Hougan, the role of Bitcoin in an investment portfolio differs fundamentally from that of gold. While both assets can serve as hedges, Bitcoin’s higher volatility means it can amplify gains or losses, making it more suitable for investors willing to take on risk for potentially higher rewards. In contrast, gold’s stability offers a more conservative approach, providing steady protection against economic uncertainties. “When you add Bitcoin to a portfolio, it boosts returns without increasing risk, and when you add gold to a portfolio, you get the same return but less risk,” he told Quartz. Hougan pointed out that, despite their similarities and differences, gold and Bitcoin do not have the same impact on an investment portfolio. He used a vivid analogy to illustrate this, comparing the two assets to ingredients in a soup. Adding gold to a portfolio, he explained, is like adding water to a soup—it doesn’t alter the flavor significantly unless a substantial amount is added. Gold’s stability and gradual influence mean it acts as a steadying force, but its effect is subtle unless it forms a large part of the investment mix. In contrast, Hougan likened adding Bitcoin to a portfolio to adding pepper to a soup; even a small amount can make a noticeable difference. Due to its higher volatility and growth potential, Bitcoin can have a pronounced impact on portfolio performance, amplifying returns but also introducing greater risk. This analogy underscores how Bitcoin, despite its smaller allocation, can play a more dynamic and immediate role in an investor’s strategy. In his analysis, Matthew Hougan referenced data from Bitwise that demonstrated how even a modest allocation of Bitcoin—such as 1.0%, 2.5%, or 5.0%—to a traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio could significantly enhance returns while only marginally increasing risk. For instance, a 2.5% allocation to Bitcoin was shown to improve overall portfolio returns by as much as 50 percentage points, with only a slight uptick in volatility. This suggests that Bitcoin’s potential for high growth can meaningfully boost portfolio performance, even at low levels of exposure. In contrast, Hougan explained that gold had a more subtle impact on returns. While it did not contribute as much to boosting gains, gold played a key role in reducing overall portfolio risk, acting as a stabilizing asset during periods of economic uncertainty. This distinction highlights the different roles these assets can play within a diversified investment strategy—Bitcoin as a high-growth, higher-risk element, and gold as a steady, risk-mitigating component. Over the past 30 years, more than 5,000 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been launched across various sectors, but Bitcoin ETFs have outpaced them all, including the highly successful gold ETFs. Following SEC approval and their subsequent debut in January 2024, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $21 billion in total net flows, a remarkable achievement considering the typical challenges faced by new ETFs. By comparison, it took gold ETFs around five years to reach the same level of net inflows. Hougan agreed, stating that Bitcoin is a more effective addition to a portfolio than gold for achieving the goals most investors seek. This year, in addition to Bitcoin ETFs, Ether ETFs also received approval from the SEC, raising the likelihood that other crypto ETFs, such as those for XRP and Solana, could soon follow. At the launch of Ether ETFs, Hougan predicted that these exchange-traded products would have an even greater impact on Ethereum than they did on Bitcoin. He noted that the introduction of Ether ETFs could drive up the price of Ether, potentially pushing it beyond the $5,000 mark. He told Quartz that if Bitcoin is like digital gold, Ether is like a tech play, and it belongs in the Nasdaq 100 effectively, like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and others. Like these tech giants, Ether is driven by innovation and utility, given its role as the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts. “If you’re a tech investor and you don’t have Ethereum, you’re missing out,” he said. “It’d be like a tech investor not owning Nvidia.” Hougan emphasized the significance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, by noting the recent trends in both Bitcoin and gold prices. He pointed out that Bitcoin is approaching its all-time high, while gold has already reached its peak, signaling growing concerns among investors about the stability of traditional fiat currencies and broader economic uncertainties. According to Hougan, this trend underscores a shift in investor sentiment: Bitcoin offers the potential for higher returns, making it an attractive option for those seeking growth, while gold remains a go-to asset for those prioritizing stability and preservation of wealth. The choice between the two ultimately comes down to an investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Those willing to accept higher volatility for the possibility of greater rewards may lean towards Bitcoin, while more conservative investors might prefer the steady, time-tested security of gold. “Keep your stocks, keep your bonds, but carve out a little space for this new asset [Bitcoin] that provides unique enhancements to your portfolio and has, in our view, significant upside potential,” he added.

Title: Intel Stock Price Levels to Watch as Struggling Chipmaker's Earnings Loom

Intel (INTC) shares will be in focus this week as investors await the beleaguered chipmaker’s third quarter results after Thursday’s closing bell. Analysts expect the company to report a decline in revenue for the period owing to softening demand for both its PC and server chips as it faces intensifying competition from rivals, such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and artificial intelligence (AI) darling Nvidia (NVDA). Investors will look for further updates from executives about the company’s turnaround plans, which has helped underpin a 23% recovery in the chipmaker’s stock from its early-September low. However, the shares still remain more than 50% lower since the start of the year through Friday’s close, as the company’s dominance in the chip market continues to shrink. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intel’s weekly chart and point out important price levels to watch out for as the chipmaker prepares to report its quarterly results. Since breaking above the neckline of a double bottom on above-average volume last month, Intel shares have remained stuck in a sideways drift, with a doji forming last week—a candlestick pattern that indicates indecision. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) has flattened out in recent weeks, confirming rangebound conditions in the stock. Amid the potential for earnings-driven volatility, let’s outline several important levels on Intel’s chart that investors will likely be watching. Firstly, it’s worth keep an eye on the $22 level. This area on the chart sits just 3% below Friday’s close and has provided support over the past month near the double bottom pattern’s neckline. A decisive breakdown below this region could see the chipmaker’s stock revisit the $19 level, an area where bargain hunters may look for buying opportunities near the August and September double bottom troughs. A breakout above the recent sideways drift may drive a move up to around $25. Investors who have purchased the stock at lower levels in recent months could seek exit points near three prominent swing lows that formed on the chart between October 2022 and February last year. A rally through this level could see the shares climb to $30, a location where the price may run into overhead selling pressure near major peaks and troughs on the chart from November 2022 through to June this year. Finally, a more bullish move may lead to a retest of the $36 level, an area just above the 50-week moving average where investors could decide to lock in profits near a trendline connecting a range of comparable trading levels on the chart between June 2022 and July this year.
