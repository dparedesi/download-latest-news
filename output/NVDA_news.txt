Title: These Stocks Score From AMD's OpenAI Deal, Wall Street Analysts Say

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a number of partners that could be set to benefit from its big deal with OpenAI, according to Wall Street analysts. The ChatGPT maker committed to buying several generations of AMD's AI chips, sending shares of the semiconductor firm up 24% yesterday and another 4% on Tuesday. The announcement also boosted shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB), Dell Technologies (DELL), and others that have business with AMD. J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note to clients Tuesday that they see current AMD partners and AI server makers Supermicro, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as poised to gain from the deal. They also highlighted Arista Networks (ANET) and Sanmina (SANM), which earlier this year agreed to buy ZT Systems’ Data Center Infrastructure manufacturing business from AMD and became a preferred manufacturing partner as part of the agreement. Several analysts suggested AMD's deal could be taken as a positive signal for the semiconductor sector and AI trade broadly, though they pointed to some of AMD's networking partners as more direct beneficiaries. The deal underscores the wide-ranging impact of the surge in AI demand on companies and stocks, with analysts likening the AI boom to a rising tide that lifts all boats. "While the announcements till date from OpenAI have largely focused on tight partnerships with semiconductor companies, we expect to see similar partnerships with Hardware and Networking companies as critical to scaling infrastructure," J.P. Morgan said. Citi analysts said they see AMD's OpenAI agreement as presenting a positive read-through for memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) and Astera Labs as well. Astera, which supplies connectivity solutions for AI data centers and counts Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD as customers, saw its stock pop 10% Monday, before pulling back Tuesday.

Time Published: 2025-10-07T14:57:32Z
Full Content:
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares rose Tuesday after soaring yesterday to a 19-month high on news that the chip designer and ChatGPT maker OpenAI have inked a multi-year supply deal. Under the agreement, OpenAI is committing to buying several generations of AI chips from AMD in a long-term deal that could see it take a 10% stake in the Nvidia (NVDA) rival. AMD said it anticipates the ripple effect of the deal to net it more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers. AMD shares, which jumped 24% on Monday, were up more than 5% at around $215 in recent trading, putting the stock on pace for a record closing high. The stock is up 77% since the start of the year, handily outpacing Nvidia’s 40% return over the same period. Below, we take a closer look at AMD’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to identify critical price levels worth watching out for. AMD shares staged a dramatic breakout from an inverse head and shoulders pattern on Monday, laying the groundwork for follow-through buying. While the surge coincided with the relative strength index crossing into overbought territory, the indicator remains below peaks that preceded drawdowns in November 2021 and March 2024. However, the stock closed near its low for the day yesterday, indicating a short-term over-extension. Let’s point out two critical overhead areas to watch on AMD’s chart if the shares continue their bullish run and also identify support levels worth monitoring during potential pullbacks. If the chipmaker’s shares regain their upward momentum, investors should initially keep track of the $227 area. This location on the chart would likely attract significant attention near Monday's high, which coincidently sits just below the stock’s record intraday high set in March last year. Investors can project an overhead area to watch above the stock’s all-time high by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to forecast future price movements. When applying the study to AMD’s chart, we calculate the distance from the inverse head and shoulders’ head to neckline in points and add that amount to the pattern’s neckline. For example, adding $98 to $174 projects a bullish target of $272, about 34% above Monday's closing price. During retracements, it’s worth watching for a potential fill of yesterday's stock gap down to around $174. Investors would likely see this as a high probability buying area near the inverse head and shoulders’ neckline, which could flip from prior resistance to future support. Finally, a steeper pullback would open the door to a retest of the $150 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the inverse head and shoulders’ two shoulders, which closely align with the December 2023 high.

Title: Nvidia Stock 2x To $350?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/07/nvidia-stock-2x-to-350/
Time Published: 2025-10-07T09:30:26Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Will Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) reach $350 in the upcoming years? This likelihood is more than mere speculation. In the last six months alone, Nvidia’s share price has almost doubled, soaring from around $94 per share to nearly $185. At first sight, trading at approximately 42x consensus adjusted FY’26 earnings and 62x for FY’25, the stock may seem expensive. However, considering Nvidia's remarkable earnings growth (with EPS anticipated to increase by nearly 50% this year), its leading role in accelerated computing, and the substantial potential for AI adoption, the valuation begins to appear more justifiable. CEO Jensen Huang foresees that spending on AI infrastructure could rise to $4 trillion by the decade's conclusion, and if artificial general intelligence (AGI) materializes even partially, the need for high-performance computing could soar. Below, we illustrate a possible path indicating how Nvidia’s revenue, profitability, and valuation multiples could elevate its stock to over $350 per share, nearing a $10 trillion market cap. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like NVDA, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Nvidia’s revenues have nearly doubled over the past 12 months, while achieving an average annual growth rate of about 69% over the previous three years, and this momentum could persist. If Nvidia increases its sales at an average annual rate of approximately 60% for the next two years and around 45% in the third year—its revenues could rise from about $131 billion in FY’25 to roughly $486 billion by FY’28, or nearly 3.7x. Several trends could continue to fuel Nvidia’s growth. While the initial AI models implemented by companies like OpenAI in 2022 were mainly text-based, AI is increasingly evolving to be multimodal—handling speech, images, video, and even 3D—which necessitates greater computing power and a higher quantity of GPU shipments. Activity in AI deal-making shows no signs of deceleration. In the past three months, Nvidia has completed some of its most significant AI-related agreements, including a $100 billion investment and partnership with OpenAI, covering the provision of advanced AI chips and an equity stake, a $6.3 billion cloud capacity agreement with CoreWeave, and Microsoft’s $19.4 billion contract with Nebius, which secures access to nearly 100,000 of Nvidia’s latest GPU chips to boost its AI capabilities. Separately, see How SOUN Stock Falls To $2? The next significant tech revolution could be AGI—Artificial General Intelligence—and Nvidia is positioned at the core of it. Though the timeline is uncertain, the objective is to enable AI to reason, plan, and learn new tasks without requiring retraining. Artificial General Intelligence could conduct scientific research, generate innovative insights, or design complete products independently. This potential could unlock breakthroughs and innovations across various industries, with some models suggesting that AGI could elevate global GDP growth from low single-digit percentages to over 20% annually. [1] As the world approaches AGI, Nvidia stands to gain significantly. AGI will require immense computing power to train and operate, far exceeding current AI models, and Nvidia’s GPUs are the gold standard for these high-performance functions. Combining this robust revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, expressed as a percentage of revenues) are on an upward trend—they increased from approximately 25% in FY’19 to around 51% in FY’25 as the company benefited from enhanced economies of scale and a more favorable product mix biased toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also on the rise. We can assume that margins will remain stable at current levels since Nvidia's introduction of pricier high-end products, such as the latest Blackwell chips, is offset by potentially increased costs and competition in the low-end market from competitors like AMD. With margins staying steady and revenue increasing 3.7x, we could witness earnings rise 3.7x. If earnings increase by 3.7x, the PE multiple will decline by 3.7x to approximately 18x, assuming the stock price remains constant. But that’s precisely what Nvidia investors are betting will not occur. If earnings grow 3.7x over the next few years, instead of the trailing PE decreasing from around 62x currently to roughly 18x, a situation where the PE metric remains around 32x appears quite probable. For context, Apple—a company experiencing low single-digit growth—trades at 30x. This scenario could mean Nvidia's stock could grow by approximately 1.9x within the next three years or so, a tangible possibility, leading to a share price exceeding $350. What about the timeline for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t significantly matter whether it takes three years or four, as long as Nvidia continues on this revenue growth trajectory, coupled with margins holding steady, the stock price could respond accordingly. As always, investing in a single company stock carries risk. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a blend of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000) to deliver strong returns for investors. The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provides a flexible approach to capitalize on bullish markets while minimizing drawdowns, as shown in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

The Malaysia stock market on Friday snapped the five-day winning streak in which it had rallied more than 35 points or 2.2 percent. The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index now sits just above the 1,635-point plateau and it figures to remain in that neighborhood again on Monday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is murky as the U.S. government shutdown continues. The European and U.S. markets were mixed and little changed and the Asian bourses are expected to open in similar fashion. The KLCI finished slightly lower on Friday following losses from the telecoms and mixed performances from the financial shares and property stocks. For the day, the index slipped 2.74 points or 0.17 percent to finish at 1,635.06 after trading between 1,631.43 and 1,658.73. Among the actives, 99 Speed Mart Retail rallied 1.39 percent, while AMMB Holdings sank 0.68 percent, Celcomdigi lost 0.54 percent, CIMB Group climbed 1.05 percent, Gamuda dipped 0.18 percent, IHH Healthcare tanked 1.57 percent, IOI Corporation gathered 0.25 percent, Kuala Lumpur Kepong stumbled 1.66 percent, Maxis rose 0.27 percent, Maybank and PPB Group both perked 0.20 percent, MISC added 0.54 percent, MRDIY jumped 1.20 percent, Nestle Malaysia and Hong Leong Bank both eased 0.10 percent, Petronas Chemicals advanced 0.94 percent, Petronas Dagangan increased 0.78 percent, Petronas Gas gained 0.43 percent, Press Metal shed 0.67 percent, Public Bank dropped 0.69 percent, QL Resources improved 0.92 percent, Sunway fell 0.34 percent, Telekom Malaysia slumped 0.70 percent, Tenaga Nasional tumbled 1.34 percent and YTL Corporation, YTL Power, RHB Bank, Sime Darby, SD Guthrie and Axiata were unchanged. The lead from Wall Street offers little clarity as the major averages opened higher on Friday but went off in different directions to finish mixed. The Dow jumped 238.58 points or 0.51 percent to finish at a record 46,758.28, while the NASDAQ sank 63.59 points or 0.28 percent to end at 22,780.51 and the S&P 500 perked 0.44 points or 0.01 percent to close at 6,715.79, also a record. For the week, the NASDAQ rallied 1.3 percent, while the Dow and the S&P both rose 1.1 percent. The NASDAQ sank on weakness from technology shares such as Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). The lackluster performance by the broader markets came as the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has led to the indefinite delay of key U.S. economic data, including Friday's closely watched monthly jobs report. However, weak data from non-government sources has increased confidence that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates in the coming months. Crude oil prices advanced on Friday amid U.S. dollar weakness as the government shutdown persisted. West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery was up $0.41 or 0.68 percent at $60.89 per barrel. For comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com October 03, 2025 16:10 ET First half of this week the focus was on efforts to avoid a government shutdown in the U.S. However, talks to avert one failed and an almost total blackout of federal government began on October 1, Wednesday. The weekly claims data due on Thursday and the job report on Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were not released. In Europe, inflation data in the euro area raised concern and the latest interest rate decision from India was among the main news in Asia.

Micron Technology's (MU) stock has had a strong run in 2025 so far, and some Wall Street bulls say it's set to move. higher, as AI-driven orders grow. The memory chip maker's shares were up about 3% to around $193 in recent trading, extending their recent rally and putting them on track to top Friday's closing record. The stock has added more than half its value since the year began, making it one of the S&P 500's top performers for 2025. Morgan Stanley analysts upgraded the stock to “overweight” from a neutral rating on Monday, and lifted their price target to $220 from $160, a bit above the $196 average target compiled by Visible Alpha, pointing to booming demand for its high-bandwidth memory to support AI. "Conviction from our purchasing contacts is very high," the analysts said, adding "we see more room to run." Many of the S&P 500's top performers this year are companies that make data storage or memory products needed to support AI data centers, like Micron, and stand to benefit from the same tailwinds. Micron, which counts leading AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) among its partners, last month posted record quarterly sales, thanks in large part to growth from its data center business. AMD announced a massive deal on Monday with OpenAI that sent its stock soaring nearly 30% in recent trading. The news also helped lift shares of partner stocks like Micron and Astera Labs (ALAB), which saw its stock jump 11%.

As investors and traders await any developments from Washington DC, Tom White points out the fact that in the previous 5 government shutdowns equity markets actually rose higher. He joins Diane King Hall to set up the trading week before turning to a pair of big premarket movers. AMD (AMD) is jumping on news that it reached a deal to sell a potential 10% stake to OpenAI in tranches. And, Micron (MU) begins Monday's action with an upgrade at Morgan Stanley and a new price target to $220.

APPRECIATED Thanks for your kind remark! I own a lot of AMD shares. I looked at the price when I went to bed and it was up like $1.25. Then a few hours before opening bell I saw it was up like $56 then as much as $64 I went to sleep happy.

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stock prices remained strong Friday on AI optimism and the expectation of lower interest rates later this year. The large-cap S&P 500 index rose slightly to close at a record high, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite pulled back 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index, rose 0.5%, also hitting a new high. The U.S. government shutdown has not soured the stock market, even though the closure delayed an important jobs report due Friday. Other data due this week will likely be delayed also. Enthusiasm for AI’s future is commanding more attention than U.S. political leaders’ inability to compromise. In the last two weeks, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL ) announced leadership changes to facilitate AI growth, OpenAI was valued at $500 billion, Hitachi partnered with OpenAI on a data center buildout and Fujitsu teamed with Nvidia (NVDA) to build AI robots. The AI frenzy still has legs, and it’s driving decisions at the world’s largest companies. Amid the deal-making, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos shared his characterization of the environment—that while AI has real benefits, the technology is in “an industrial bubble” where good and bad ideas are getting funded. Bezos was speaking at Italian Tech Week. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are up ahead of the market open on Monday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones have gained 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures are up 0.6%. Economic data coming from the federal government will be delayed due to the shutdown. Alcoholic beverage producer Constellation Brands (STZ) will report earnings after the market closes. Analysts expect STZ to report $3.41 EPS for the August quarter. The company’s EPS in the prior-year quarter was $4.32. Constellation Brands has fallen short of EPS expectations in two of the last three quarters. How does inflation affect your investments? The U.S. central bank, called the Fed, targets 2% inflation as the optimal rate for a healthy, growing economy. Inflation above 2% can create uncertainty, reduce consumer spending, put pressure on household and business budgets and shrink profits. Typically, the Fed addresses high inflation by raising interest rates, which can prompt more of the same: rising costs, lower spending and smaller profits. For these reasons, stock prices often grow more slowly or decline during periods of high inflation. But some companies fare better than others. Companies selling commodities or essential goods can do well in inflationary times. Commodities like oil, gas, precious metals and agricultural products become more valuable and can command higher prices under inflationary pressures. Essential goods have consistent demand—people keep buy toilet paper and toothpaste as prices rise. Essential goods with strong brand loyalty, like Charmin, do especially well, because their customers are less likely to switch to generic brands to save money. The other inflation consequence to consider is the drag on the value of your investment returns. Say your investments grow 10% at a time when inflation is 4%. You gained on the investments but lost on the inflation. Your net return can be approximated as 6%, or 10% less 4%. In investing lingo, the 10% is your nominal return and the 6% is your real return. Note that there is a more complicated real return formula that accounts for compounding, but the simple formula is adequate for estimates. Inflation can force a negative real return on assets that have appreciated or earned income. This is common for cash deposits and low-rate bonds. You could earn 1% in a traditional savings account while inflation is 2.9%, for example. In this scenario, the approximate net return is negative 1.9%. There are other benefits to holding cash, so investors commonly accept the potential for negative returns. The usual strategy is to offset negative cash returns by diversifying into higher-performing categories like stocks. Over the long-term, stocks outperform inflation.

Title: Major challenge to Nvidia: OpenAI’s massive new computing push will run on AMD chips | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks In a significant challenge to Nvidia’s dominance, OpenAI announced Monday it would buy 6 gigawatts of computing power from data centers that will run exclusively on AMD chips. Nvidia (NVDA) has become the go-to AI chipmaker in recent years, propelling it to a $4.6 trillion market capitalization that has made it the world’s most valuable public company. OpenAI, famous for its ChatGPT AI chatbot, is the artificial-intelligence frontrunner that just made waves when it launched the breakthrough video generator Sora 2. Just two weeks ago, the companies announced a $100 billion partnership, in which Nvidia agreed to start delivering chips in 2026. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X that the company plans to increase its Nvidia purchasing and that the AMD partnership is “incremental” to its “work with Nvidia.” But AMD is no slouch, and demand for AI computing power is so high that OpenAI needed to hedge its bets. The deal will provide OpenAI with 1 gigawatt of power by this time next year and it will add another 5 gigawatts on future generations of AMD’s high-end Instinct processors. OpenAI will work with AMD (AMD) to build the technology, and it will invest significantly in AMD to fuel its chip-building capabilities. Shares of AMD jumped 36% in premarket trading on the news. Shares of Nvidia fell 2%. “With a 10% stake in AMD this quickly brings Lisa Su and AMD right into the core of the AI chip spending cycle and is a huge vote of confidence from OpenAI and Altman,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in an industry note Monday morning. The companies said the partnership would deliver tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AMD, but they didn’t disclose the exact amount of the deal. AMD issued OpenAI a warrant of 160 million shares of its stock, worth more than $26.3 billion at Friday’s closing price. Those shares would vest over time as the partnership achieves specific milestones, including share-price targets and overcoming technological hurdles for what Lisa Su, AMD’s CEO, called “the world’s most ambitious AI buildout.” “This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI’s full potential,” Altman said in a statement. “AMD’s leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.” Su called the partnership a “win-win.” The amount of money getting thrown around the AI industry is staggering. In addition to the AMD and Nvidia deals, OpenAI agreed last month to pay Oracle $300 billion over five years for 4.5 gigawatts of data center space. And OpenAI is believed to have inked a $10 billion chip design deal with Broadcom to train its AI models, a move that could potentially reduce its reliance on partners like Nvidia and AMD. That’s why the AMD announcement may have been significant, but not exactly surprising — OpenAI has been diversifying its supply of chips for a while, notes Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “AMD is another big player in this space, so this deal is a logical move from OpenAI and is great news for AMD,” said Barringer. It’s no surprise that the eight most valuable companies on the market are all heavily invested in AI — and all are worth more than $1.4 trillion. Following Nvidia are Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META), each of which announced new consumer-focused AI products in recent months. Broadcom, with a $1.6 trillion valuation, is No. 7 on the list. And Elon Musk’s Tesla, which has bet its future on AI-powered robotaxis and could soon make a large investment in Musk’s xAI company, is No. 8 on the list. Although those companies have driven enormous market gains over the past several years, many Wall Street analysts fear that the AI market has become a bubble — powered by unsustainable gains that are driven more by FOMO than fundamentals.
