Title: OpenAI Is World's Top Startup With $500B Valuation After Employee Share Sale
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/openai-is-worlds-top-startup-with-500b-valuation-after-employee-share-sale-11822885
Time Published: 2025-10-02T14:54:23Z
Full Content:
OpenAI has reportedly finalized a secondary share sale that values the artificial intelligence company at $500 billion, making the ChatGPT owner the world's most valuable startup ever. The share sale, which allows employees to cash out, comes just months after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta Platforms (META) was poaching the company's AI staff with signing bonuses as high as $100 million. OpenAI's sky-high valuation suggests investor demand for AI plays, which has helped propel the major U.S. equities indexes to record highs, remains strong. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI's current and former employees sold about $6.6 billion in stock in a deal that has has vaulted the company past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. OpenAI had a $300 billion valuation earlier this year. Rocket company SpaceX is valued at $400 billion, Bloomberg said. Investors that bought into the secondary share sale—where investors buy from other investors rather than the company—included Japan's SoftBank, which put forth $30 billion in a funding round earlier this year. Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price also snapped up shares, the report said. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT), is the latest of a string of AI startups to have seen valuations soar as investors are eager for exposure ahead of potential market entries. Nvidia (NVDA) also said last month that it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, has a market capitalization of well over $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable publicly listed company. OpenAI didn't immediately respond to an Investopedia request for comment.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Telegram is taking another step toward bridging traditional finance with crypto. Through a new partnership among Wallet in Telegram, xStocks operator Backed, and US-based crypto exchange Kraken, tokenized equities will soon be available directly within the messaging platform. The announcement, made on Wednesday, confirms that users will gain access to tokenized versions of US equities. Wallet in Telegram, a third-party crypto wallet app integrated into the Telegram ecosystem, will serve as the gateway for this new offering. By leveraging xStocks, which specializes in tokenized assets, and Kraken’s infrastructure, the platform aims to deliver seamless trading of tokenized stocks and ETFs. Users will be able to purchase fractions of these equities in digital form, opening access to markets that are typically less inclusive. This move represents a significant evolution in Telegram’s crypto ecosystem, expanding beyond digital assets into the tokenization of traditional securities. It also underscores the growing role of tokenized finance in making equities more accessible, liquid, and tradable across global markets. With the launch planned for late October, investors are watching closely to see how Telegram’s massive user base responds to this new frontier. The news was shared by Wallet in Telegram’s chief strategy officer, Halil Mirakhmed, during Token2024 Singapore, highlighting the project’s mission to merge traditional financial markets with Web3 accessibility. At the same event, Max Crown, President & CEO of the TON Foundation, outlined the significance of the move in his keynote at Token2049. He emphasized that the partnership with xStocks, in collaboration with Kraken and Backed, will allow over 100 million Telegram users to access more than 60 tokenized US assets at launch. These will include major names such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and MicroStrategy (MSTR), all backed by a 1:1 collateralization framework to ensure trust and transparency. One of the most notable features of this integration is fractional ownership, which enables users to purchase small portions of high-value stocks that might otherwise remain inaccessible. Trading will also be available 24 hours a day, five days a week, breaking away from the restrictions of traditional US market hours. This flexibility lowers barriers for global investors and represents a major step toward democratizing access to equities. Looking ahead, xStocks is set to become available on the TON blockchain in Q4, further cementing TON’s role as the foundation for Telegram’s growing financial ecosystem. By combining blockchain scalability, tokenization, and Telegram’s massive user base, the initiative has the potential to redefine how millions of people interact with traditional markets. Toncoin (TON) is trading around $2.80 after a modest rebound of nearly 3.6% on the 3-day chart. Despite the short-term bounce, the broader trend remains bearish, with TON locked in a prolonged downtrend since peaking above $8.50 in early 2024. Price has consistently posted lower highs and lower lows, signaling persistent selling pressure. The moving averages reinforce this picture. TON remains well below its 50-period (blue), 100-period (green), and 200-period (red) moving averages. The inability to reclaim these levels underscores weak momentum and the dominance of bears in the market. The $3.00 area has become a critical resistance zone; without a decisive break above it, TON risks further sideways or downward action. Support continues to cluster near $2.50–$2.70, where buyers have stepped in repeatedly over the past months. A breakdown below this level could accelerate losses toward $2.00, while a successful defense may allow the token to consolidate and attempt another push higher.

Reports of a potential acquisition helped shares of a utility company power higher, while an agricultural sciences firm faced pressure after it announced a plan to separate into two independent entities. Major U.S. equities indexes recovered from early losses to end higher on the first trading day after a federal government shutdown took effect. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Dow eked out a 0.1% gain to finish at all-time highs. The Nasdaq climbed 0.4% to finish just short of its closing record. Find the full market summary from Investopedia here. Shares of renewable energy provider AES (AES) surged nearly 17%, gaining the most of any S&P 500 stock. The push higher followed reports that Global Infrastructure Partners, owned by asset management giant BlackRock (BLK), is in talks to buy AES. The deal could be worth around $38 billion, which would make it one of the largest infrastructure takeovers ever. Pharmaceutical stocks and others in the healthcare sector extended their gains Wednesday, a day after Pfizer (PFE) became the first major drugmaker to comply with a push from the White House cut medication prices in the U.S. to the lower levels seen in other countries. According to media reports, other major pharma companies could follow Pfizer's lead and seek pricing deals with the Trump administration. Shares of Biogen (BIIB), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), Eli Lilly (LLY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) all ranked among the benchmark index's top performers Wednesday. Shares of memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner Micron Technology (MU) advanced close to 9%, along with hard drive makers Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC). The moves extended recent gains on anticipation they could benefit from growing demand for data storage to support AI. Corteva (CTVA) shares tumbled 9.1%, logging the S&P 500's weakest performance Wednesday, after the agricultural sciences firm announced a plan to split its crop protection and its seed businesses into two independent companies. The company expects the transaction to be complete by the second half of 2026. Shares of tech-focused research firm Gartner (IT) fell 4.5%. Although the U.S. federal government accounts for less than 5% of Gartner's revenue, the government shutdown weighed on sentiment across the advisory industry. Gartner stock has also faced pressure stemming from concerns about how AI could disrupt the research business. Interpublic Group (IPG) stock lost 5% on Wednesday, reversing gains posted in the prior session after German biotech giant Bayer (BAYRY) named IPG as the exclusive creative and media partner for its consumer health business. IPG and fellow marketing firm Omnicom (OMC) announced that the regulatory approval process for their intended merger remains in progress and that they expect the deal to close by year-end. Omnicom shares also slipped 5%.

Title: AI Stocks Have Fueled the Bull Market for 3 Years—Will the Momentum Continue?

Full Content:
The U.S. stock market entered the final quarter of the year near record highs, boosted by soaring AI stocks that have become increasingly critical for the market's performance. Most of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year are directly tied to the AI boom. Data storage companies Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) have seen their shares nearly triple in value this year, while Palantir (PLTR) and Applovin (APP), two software firms that have excelled at translating AI capabilities into revenue, have more than doubled. And despite a rough start to 2025, all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are up since the start of the year. The artificial intelligence boom has been the primary source of fuel propelling the bull market of the past few years. As such, the performance of most investment portfolios is increasingly tethered to the performance of AI stocks. The Magnificent Seven account for one-third of the S&P 500, and thus have an outsized influence over the broader market’s performance. And these stocks, experts say, are increasingly tied to AI. The Mag 7's “share prices are a daily referendum on whether AI is considered hype or reality,” wrote Christopher Gannatti, Global Head of Research at WisdomTree, in a recent blog post. They “are priced as if AI is not just a growth driver, but the growth driver,” Gannatti added. As such, the investments, deals and optimism propelling the AI trade are likely to be pivotal for the entire stock market in the coming months. Massive infrastructure investment from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) has been a primary source of fuel for the AI rally. Their spending has caused revenue at chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron (MU) to explode, and underpinned the narrative that AI demand is insatiable. The hyperscalers will all update investors on their capital expenditure plans when they report quarterly results in late October and early November. Alphabet and Meta each lifted their capex forecasts in their most recent earnings reports, while Microsoft and Amazon said they would continue to invest heavily in infrastructure throughout the year. Tax changes codified by the One Big, Beautiful Bill, which empowers companies to immediately write off infrastructure investments, could give them reason to lift capex further. Experts note immediate write-offs should boost free cash flow, allowing companies to invest even more in AI. Hyperscalers have had a few months to figure out how the bill, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, will affect their finances and, thus, investments. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers, including Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV), will spend $490 billion on infrastructure, up from their prior estimate of $420 billion. “We expect the major hyperscalers to reflect this incremental spend in guidance discussions during 3Q results,” the analysts wrote. Unexpected increases to capex guidance could reinforce Wall Street’s bullishness on the semiconductor, software, and energy companies benefiting most from the AI buildout. “We’re seeing a bit of an evolution” in the drivers of the AI rally, Gannatti told Investopedia. “It kind of started with the hyperscalers—Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet—saying, ‘We have a certain amount of cash flow. We’re going to make investments.’” Today, Gannatti says, AI companies are investing in one another, and using those investments to buy goods and services from each other. The most notable example of this was announced last month, when OpenAI committed to deploying 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems to train and run its next-generation models. In return, Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as capacity comes online, effectively subsidizing the start-up's infrastructure expenses. “So there’s a bit of circularity,” says Gannatti, who notes there’s a risk to these sorts of deals. “None of these things are guaranteed,” he said, including OpenAI’s commitment to spend $300 billion on Oracle’s cloud computing services over the next five years. “If the business environment changes, the music might need to stop—not necessarily forever, but for a while.” Investors have worried about an AI bubble for quite some time, and the rally faces the risk that AI sentiment sours, weighing on investment and depressing stock valuations. So far, tech companies have been able to show investors enough benefit from AI to keep Wall Street comfortable with their spending, said Gannatti. “But you feel like you’re always one earnings cycle away from a negative interpretation of a certain announcement,“ the kind of less-than-ideal development that throws cold water on a red-hot market, he added. Several events this year have briefly appeared to be this watershed moment. In January, investors caught wind of Chinese start-up DeepSeek’s super-efficient reasoning model, briefly calling into question the wisdom of Silicon Valley’s AI spending. And AI stocks swooned over the summer when an MIT study found that 95% of corporate generative AI pilot projects failed to deliver any material return on investment. Yet, on every occasion, investors have shaken off the panic and continued to pile into AI stocks. There are reasons to be optimistic that today’s AI boom is more resilient than the bubbles to which it is often compared. “The positive is it’s not being financed by debt, at least not yet,” said Gannatti. “So it's not like the fiber optic buildouts in, say, 1999 and 2000, where the companies didn't even have the fundamentals.” Instead, the companies funding the AI buildout have some of the biggest businesses, healthiest balance sheets, and deepest pockets of any companies on earth. Their hugely profitable non-AI businesses could mitigate the fallout of a shift in sentiment toward AI.

Title: Big Tech's AI Spending—and Borrowing—Will Be Even Higher Next Year, Says Citi
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/big-tech-s-ai-spending-and-borrowing-will-be-even-higher-next-year-says-citi-11821812
Time Published: 2025-09-30T22:39:30Z
Full Content:
After a series of big cloud computing deals this month, Citigroup analysts now expect AI spending to exceed their already eye-watering forecast. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers—including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV)—will spend $490 billion on infrastructure and other capital goods next year, up from a prior estimate of $420 billion. Citi’s forecasts are slightly above the Wall Street consensus. The AI infrastructure boom has been a major force behind U.S. stock market gains and economic growth in recent years. If tech companies rely on debt to fund their massive AI investments, they could expose the AI buildout—and the broader economy—to greater risk. The analysts pointed to an onslaught of announced partnerships, investments, and products in recent weeks as evidence of strong AI demand. They said their recent conversations with CIOs and CTOs at a range of companies “reflect a similar increase in urgency around adoption at the enterprise level.” Citi expects AI infrastructure providers like Nvidia (NVDA) to benefit from higher spending. As such, the firm’s analysts raised their price target on Nvidia shares to $210 from $200 on Tuesday. The hyperscalers are among the world’s largest, most profitable companies, a fact that has enabled them to increase their infrastructure spending exponentially over the past few years. But not even hugely profitable tech giants can undertake this level of investment on their own. “It is notable that we have gone from the cash flow funded stage of this investment cycle to the debt funded stage, with the incremental risks that come with it,” Citi’s analysts wrote. Oracle last week sold $18 billion of bonds in the second-largest U.S. debt deal this year, according to a Bloomberg report. Oracle, which has spent more than it's made in each of the last two quarters, is expected to use the debt to increase its cloud capacity so it can deliver on a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Adding that much capacity will be expensive. Citi sees Oracle’s capital expenditures ballooning to $58 billion in fiscal year 2027, nearly three times what it spent in the fiscal year that ended in May. OpenAI, another company that will need to spend a lot to support its ambitions, took a different approach to raising money. Last week, the company struck a deal with Nvidia to deploy 10 GW of Nvidia systems over the next five years in exchange for an incremental $100 billion equity investment. OpenAI is reportedly discussing leasing—not buying—the chips from Nvidia, a novel arrangement that could cut its hardware costs by 10 to 15%, according to The Information. The deal raised eyebrows on Wall Street, where some analysts and investors expressed concern about the “circularity” and concentration of the AI ecosystem. Some skeptics likened it to a bailout, with Nvidia stepping in as an investor of last resort to support a cash-starved OpenAI. It has also inspired comparisons to the Dotcom Bubble, when telecom equipment providers lent to and invested in their own customers, fueling speculative fervor. But analysts see important differences between the 1990s and today. “The critical distinction, in our view, is the ‘off-ramp’ created by growing external demand for AI services driven by enterprise adoption,” write Citi analysts. Companies like OpenAI and Meta (META), they say, are rolling out AI-driven applications and services with clear monetization prospects. And the rate of AI’s technological progress, they argue, is quickly expanding the scope of potential applications.

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. As we prepare for the fourth quarter of 2025, I find it very useful to look at the strongest stocks in 2025. I sort stocks on a year-to-date percent change basis. This exercise helps me easily spot “leading” stocks and it helps remove emotions from the decision making process. Also, it helps me find leading stocks and wait for proper buy points because many times, leading stocks tend to be in strong uptrends that can last several years. Of course, there’s a chance any and all of these stocks fall. It’s just a good exercise to see what the strongest stocks are in the market at any given time. Here are the ten strongest mega-cap stocks (so far) in 2025: 1. Palantir (PLTR)Palantir is the strongest performing mega cap stock in the market (as of this writing 9/30/25) on a year-to-date percent change basis. Palantir is a leading tech/AI stock that is growing rapidly. The company continued converting a large pipeline of government and commercial contracts into sustainable recurring revenue in 2025. Its platform-based approach is unique because it integrates data, analytics, and operational workflows. All that makes it sticky among large customers who increasingly treat Palantir as a mission-critical software partner. Expansion into vertical solutions and success in platform monetization (subscription plus consumption-based fees) contributed to stronger revenue visibility and improving operating leverage. As profitability metrics advanced, market skepticism diminished and the multiple expanded. 2. AppLovin (APP)AppLovin is another monster stock in 2025. The company developed a mobile app ecosystem to help developers monetize their work. The company is ad-tech and mobile-software player that combines effective user-acquisition tools, a growing independent game publishing arm, and targeted monetization services to grow earnings by triple digits in each of the past 4 quarters. In 2025, the company benefited from robust mobile-ad demand, improvements in measurement and privacy-safe targeting, and a higher-margin mix of platform services. Strategic investments in creative optimization, in-app commerce, and cross-promotion improved ROI for advertisers and developers, boosting revenue per active user and driving solid margin improvements. 3. General Electric (GE)General Electric’s (yes the giant industrial company) stock has soared this year. GE’s turnaround gained traction recently thanks in part to Trump’s made in America policies. GE is a leader in aviation, renewable-energy equipment, grid technologies, and many other important industries in our economy. The company has been able to focus on higher-value services and long-term service agreements which increased recurring revenue and smoothed cyclicality. Capital redeployment toward high-return businesses, debt reduction, and portfolio simplification enhanced investor confidence. Renewable and electrification tailwinds — particularly in gas turbines and wind-turbine services — supported a favorable outlook for orders and backlog conversion. All this has helped GE become one of the strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. 4. Oracle (ORCL)Oracle’s stock is an absolute monster stock. The stock vaulted over 40% after its most recent earnings report. That move made Larry Ellison the richest man in the world, surpassing Elon Musk! Oracle’s recent pivot to multi-year cloud based services has been a huge win. The company has emphasized autonomous database capabilities and verticalized cloud stacks and all that led to massive earnings and revenue growth. Subscription and cloud services growth accelerated as enterprise customers migrated mission-critical workloads to Oracle’s Gen2 and industry-focused cloud offerings. All this has helped sales and revenue grow. 5. Uber (UBER)Uber has grown far beyond just being a ride-hailing app. Today, it’s a global platform that moves people, food, and goods across dozens of countries—and in 2025, the company really hit its stride. Uber leaned on a multi-pronged growth playbook: the rebound (and expansion) of ride-share demand, profitable scaling of its delivery and logistics businesses, and new ways to monetize the platform through dynamic pricing, subscription offerings, and enterprise partnerships have all helped the stocks rally. At the same time, driver utilization and overall platform efficiency improved, which boosted unit economics. International market recoveries added another layer of growth, while Uber’s heavy investment in routing technology, machine learning, and bundling rides with delivery helped expand margins and strengthen market share against local rivals. 6. RTX (RTX)RTX, the aerospace and defense giant formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has been steadily reshaping itself into a more focused industry leader. That transformation paid off in 2025. Global defense budgets remained elevated, aerospace supply chains continued to improve, and commercial aerospace services proved resilient—all of which fueled organic growth. RTX also leaned on its reliable aftermarket and services revenue, while operational efficiencies and selective divestitures helped strengthen margins. With strong free cash flow, the company was able to buy back stock and reduce debt—moves that reassured investors looking for balance sheet discipline during a year of economic uncertainty. 7. Broadcom (AVGO)Broadcom has built a unique business that combines its world-class semiconductor products with a fast-growing software portfolio. That mix gives the company both steady hardware revenue and recurring, high-margin software income—a rare balance in the tech world. In 2025, Broadcom saw strong demand for networking gear, data center connections, and broadband and AI infrastructure. On the software side, margins have been stable and predictable. Broadcom has also benefited handsomely from the growth in AI. 8. Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia continued to dominate and remains a standout leader in the AI, Crypto, Graphics, and gaming space. Strong adoption of generative AI workloads across hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers kept demand for Nvidia’s data-center GPUs extremely high. Nvidia is a great example of a leading stock that has been leading for years. If you look at a monthly chart of Nvidia, you’ll see a very impressive uptrend. There’s a strong chance this uptrend will continue as we head into Q4 2025 and beyond. 9. Goldman Sachs (GS)Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s most influential investment banks, stood out from its peers in 2025. The firm saw stronger investment banking activity, steady inflows into its asset-management arm, and solid trading revenues. A rebound in mergers, acquisitions, and capital markets deals—especially in key regions—helped boost results. Goldman also secured lucrative advisory work on corporate restructurings and strategic acquisitions.
