Title: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Price & RTX 50 SUPER Launch Rumors: AICs Yet To Receive Plans, G7 Memory Prices Raised
URL: https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-price-rtx-50-super-launch-rumors-aics-yet-to-recieve-plans-g7-memory-prices-raised/

70% Probable Source 4/5 Corroboration 3/5 Technical 4/5 Timeline 3/5 There are various conflicting reports about the GeForce RTX 50 Super series, so it's best to take these reports with a grain of salt. Reports of DRAM getting expensive have reportedly affected the planned launch of the GeForce RTX 50 Super series. In our previous post, we mentioned that the GeForce RTX 50 Super series is reportedly delayed to Q3 2026, although it was previously planned to launch in Q1. One of the reasons is that GDDR7 memory is becoming more expensive. However, two more reports emerged today: one confirms the delayed launch while the other denies it altogether. However, NVIDIA revealed to AIC yesterday that it has not canceled the RTX 50 SUPER plan, but has temporarily postponed the release date of RTX 50 SUPER to Q3 2026. "Uniko's Hardware" is not correct. (Machine Translated) - HKEPC HKEPC states that the rumor about NVIDIA canceling the RTX 50 Super series is completely inaccurate, and NVIDIA has postponed the launch to Q3 2026, as previously mentioned. However, Benchlife says that both reports about cancellation and delayed launch are untrue. The reason cited here is the absence of any technical information with the AICs about the Super series. Benchlife says that since NVIDIA hasn't yet revealed any design information to its board partners, reports on the launch of RTX 50 Super series are nonsense. Our earlier report mentioned that NVIDIA has not yet given the design information of the GeForce RTX 50 Super series. As of November, no AIC has received the design information. Without any information, whether it is canceled or postponed, it is just nonsense. (Machine Translated) - Benchlife The GDDR7 prices have indeed increased, but there appears to be no link between the RTX 50 Super series postponement and the higher GDDR7 prices. Moreover, it's NVIDIA that ships the GDDR7 modules to its board partners along with the GPU dies, and it's NVIDIA that has reportedly raised the prices of the memory. Prominent leaker @Zed__Wang says that he doesn't know what caused this, and whether popular memory makers like Hynix, Samsung, and Micron have increased the DRAM prices. I don’t know the situation between NVDA and Hynix/Samsung/Micron, but NVDA raised the GDDR7 price when it sold to AICs in the past few weeks. NVDA sells GPU dies and memory together to the AICs, AICs do not directly purchase memory from Hynix/Samsung/Micron. It's pretty late as a refresh product, but I think NVDA will try to prolong the life cycle of the entire RTX50, so maybe it's okay for them. Nonetheless, the reports about the GeForce RTX 50 Super series launch remain under wraps. Since AICs haven't received the technical information about the series, and we are just two months away from CES, it's safe to say that NVIDIA might be releasing the new family later in 2026.

US stock market futures today surged as optimism built over Washington’s progress on ending the record 2025 government shutdown. Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures climbed sharply after the Senate cleared a 60–40 procedural vote on a short-term funding deal through January 2026. The move boosted risk appetite and sent global markets higher, with KOSPI up 3%, Nikkei 1.3%, and Hang Seng 1.5%. Tech rebounded, led by Nvidia, while energy and financial stocks gained. The 10-year Treasury yield edged up to 4.13% as investors rotated back into equities.

Title: NVIDIA Shares Dropped 7% This Week: 3 Catalysts For the Fall
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/11/09/nvidia-shares-dropped-7-this-week-3-catalysts-for-the-fall/
Time Published: 2025-11-09T21:00:44Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St Shares of NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) dropped 7.1% this week, sinking sharply after hitting a high of $211.34 on Monday morning. Yet, even with the losses, NVIDIA shares had quickly plummeted into correction territory midday Friday. Shares sank to a low of $178.91 before rebounding to close the day at $188.15, a slight gain from Thursday’s close. So, the big question facing NVIDIA investors is whether last week’s losses were the result of ‘market noise’ or were a signal of something larger and more troubling. Let’s dive into 3 catalysts that led to this week’s sell-off. The Nasdaq Composite fell more than 3% last week. Tech stocks in particular were under pressure with the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) down 4.2% NVIDIA may have fallen 7.1%, but other semiconductor stocks also fell. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) fell 5.5% while AMD (Nasdaq: AMD) plunged 8.8%. The biggest news among this group of companies at the forefront of producing AI accelerators was AMD’s earnings. Overall, the earnings were a positive piece of news for the industry. AMD forecast outlook of $9.6 billion next quarter, far ahead of Wall Street estimates of about $9.2 billion. Looking further out, AMD projects ‘tens of billions’ in revenue from their data center business from 2027. If you’re an ‘AI bull’ who believes the cycle is far from slowing down, AMD’s earnings generally supported that idea. If you’re looking for reasons the broader market took a nose dive this week, it appeared to be a broader ‘risk-off.’ Most days, technology stocks fell, more defensive industries like Financials, Healthcare, and Consumer Staples rose. Macroeconomic headlines like consumer confidence plummeting amidst the continuing government shutdown also rattled markets. Another key reason technology stocks fell this week was OpenAI ‘spooking’ the market. Earlier in the week, comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman were widely shared across both social media and within money management circles. In the video (embedded in the X post below), you can see Altman get very defensive about a very reasonable question about the company’s ability to finance aggressive spending plans from venture capitalist Brad Gerstner. Apparently, if you ask @sama how his $13 billion money-losing for profit not-for-profit can support $1.4 TRILLION of spend commitments, he gets very defensive and starts to attack non-existent short sellers.I cannot wait for @OpenAI to be a public company. pic.twitter.com/DTPVJJf86x Another key OpenAI storyline was the Wall Street Journal reporting the company was seeking a government backstop on its data center investments. The comments were made by CFO Sarah Friar in an interview with the paper, and OpenAI tried walking them back as ‘poor wording.’ Yet the damage was done. Investors are quickly reversing course and viewing OpenAI as less of a catalyst in the AI space and more of a risk. The company has been on a barnstorming PR tour for more than a month, announcing major deal after major deal and the longer the PR tour goes, the more ‘bubble talk’ grows. There were other headlines this week that captured the media’s attention, such as Jensen Huang stating ‘China is going to win the AI race’ (another statement that has been walked back). But beyond all the noise, the bottom line for NVIDIA investors is that the actual earnings news was very positive last week. Earlier, we detailed how AMD’s guidance for next quarter was very positive and the company also forecast massive scale into 2027. Another bright spot was optics companies. Lumentum, Fabrinet, and Coherent all forecast extremely strong sales. That’s an important indicator for other AI infrastructure companies, as a surge in optics is just one more datapoint in a major acceleration in data center builds. Overall, NVIDIA saw a big decline this week, but the actual news flow around the company was fairly positive this week, thanks to earnings. Their losses are mostly attributable to investors selling off risk this week and comments from OpenAI leading to added selling pressure on AI stocks.

Bitcoin is entering a much more “mature era” that is healthy for the asset and will see attention returning, according to Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn. Optimism around Bitcoin (BTC) was far stronger at the start of the year, but it may not be long before the cryptocurrency regains that same level of hype, according to Galaxy Digital’s head of research, Alex Thorn. “Attention will come back to Bitcoin, it always does,” Thorn said during an interview with CNBC on Friday, emphasizing that “Bitcoin was the hottest trade of the year at the start of the year” after Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential election. Thorn said investors have turned their attention toward areas like AI, nuclear energy, quantum technology, and gold. “There were a lot of other places to get gains this year that impeded the allocation to Bitcoin,” he said. “We’re entering a much more mature era, where distribution from old hands to new is incredibly healthy for distributing the ownership of Bitcoin,” Thorn added. While Thorn remains long-term bullish on Bitcoin, he reduced Galaxy Digital’s year-end price target to $120,000 from $185,000. A move to $120,000 represents an increase of around 17% from Bitcoin’s current price of $102,080, according to CoinMarketCap. Many of the sectors Thorn said are pulling investor attention away from Bitcoin, especially gold, are the same ones it’s often compared to. JPMorgan analysts recently said that the rise in gold volatility during its rally to all-time highs in October makes the precious metal riskier and Bitcoin “more attractive to investors,” based on the Bitcoin-to-gold volatility ratio falling to 1.8, meaning BTC carries 1.8 times the risk of gold. As for AI, it was reported on Oct. 10 that Bitcoin and Nvidia stock (NVDA) are now moving more in sync than at any point in the past year. That has some market watchers worried about a looming crash similar to the dot-com bubble era in the late 1990s.

Borderless Capital’s Amit Mehra recently said quantum computing remains years away from threatening Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole, said the situation is far more urgent and argues that the industry must implement solutions as soon as possible before it is too late.

Title: Microsoft Has Reportedly Developed “Toolkits” to Break NVIDIA’s CUDA Dominance, Slashing Inference Costs with AMD AI GPUs

Time Published: 2025-11-08T15:44:28Z

Microsoft is exploring ways to leverage the 'stack' of its AMD GPUs for inferencing workloads, as the company develops toolkits that convert NVIDIA CUDA models into ROCm-supported code. One of the reasons NVIDIA has managed to retain its dominance in the AI space is that the firm has a robust CUDA software ecosystem in place, which its competitors, such as AMD, cannot currently rival. Efforts have been made to allow cross-platform support of software stacks, but we haven't seen a solution that has become mainstream. However, according to a 'high-ranking' Microsoft employee, it is reported that the tech giant has developed 'toolkits' that allow the firm to run CUDA code on AMD GPUs by translating it into a ROCm-compatible version. Breaking CUDA's dominance isn't an easy task, as the software ecosystem is so integral to the AI industry that its adoption is almost ubiquitous, even in nations like China. However, Microsoft's toolkit, mentioned by the employee, likely employs a route that has been in the market for quite some time. One way to perform a CUDA-to-ROCm translation is through a runtime compatibility layer, which enables CUDA API calls to be translated into ROCm without requiring complete source code rewrites. One example of this is the ZLUDA tool, which intercepts CUDA calls, translates them into ROCm, and does so without requiring a full recompile. We built some toolkits to help convert like CUDA models to ROCm so you could use it on an AMD, like a 300X. We have had a lot of inquiries about what is our path with AMD, the 400X and the 450X. We're actually working with AMD on that to see what we can do to maximize that. However, due to ROCm still being a relatively 'immature' software stack, there are several API calls or pieces of code in CUDA that have no mapping with AMD's software, which, in some cases, collapses the performance, which is a high-risk problem in large datacenter environments. Another possible variant of the toolkit being mentioned here is likely an end-to-end cloud migration tool that integrates with Azure, targeting both AMD and NVIDIA instances. Of course, this does bring problems when conversions happen on a large scale, but by the looks of it, the toolkits developed by Microsoft appear to be in confined use. Now, the reason why Microsoft is pursuing the 'software conversions' here is simply because the firm is seeing an increase in inference workloads, and the company is looking for a more cost-effective workload, which is why AMD's AI chips make sense here, since they are the only counterpart to the 'pricey' NVIDIA GPUs. And since you cannot leave out CUDA models across inference environments, the translation from it to ROCm becomes the next big step for Microsoft.

Sarah Burris is a long-time veteran of political campaigns, having worked as a fundraiser and media director across the United States. She transitioned into reporting while working for Rock the Vote, Future Majority and Wiretap Magazine, covering the Millennial Generation's perspective during the presidential elections. As a political writer, Burris has had bylines at CNN, Salon.com, BNR, and AlterNet and serves as a senior digital editor for RawStory.com. Women in Media Center The Nasdaq Composite had its worst week since April this week, numbers show. Market Watch attributed the flop to the tech industry and the government shutdown. Yahoo Finance cited "seesaw stretches for 'Magnificent Seven' stalwarts Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). The S&P 500 and the Dow also closed out the bumpy week in the red as persistent worries about an AI bubble and Big Tech valuations run high." MSNBC VP of editorial and bookings, Jesse Rodriguez, wrote on X, "US stock indexes are on track for their worst five-day start to November since 2008." "The Warren Buffett Indicator (market cap to GDP), the Shiller CAPE ratio (stock prices to earnings), and my Dr. X bubble detector are at record highs. WHEN WILL THE BUBBLE BURST?" asked Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. "You can get people to believe a lot of things, but I guarantee you can't get them to believe grocery prices are down," said chief economist Tim Duy at SGH Macro Advisors, referring to President Donald Trump's argument that prices for everything are better. Stock associate Mike Bostic flagged concerns over the labor market, shutdown and AI bubble as the possible cause. "Ping! Is that the bubble bursting?! Bad day for American AI and tech stocks today..." said academic researcher Dr. Ian McCormick. He later added, "The selloff seems to be driven by anxiety over the ongoing US government shutdown, the resulting dearth of economic data, and warnings that an AI bubble might burst soon." In the background, "Elon will be a trillionaire. Wild," said Certified Financial Education Instructor Kalu Aja. "Thanks, Donald!" blamed media executive John Goodman.

Title: Elon Musk says 'TeraFab' chip fab may be the only answer to Tesla's colossal AI semiconductor demand — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warns against 'extremely hard' challenge

A new approach to chipmaking? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Elon Musk is thinking about outsourcing some of Tesla’s chip production to Intel Foundry and even establishing the company’s own chip production operation, he said at the company’s Annual Shareholder Meeting event. Musk is perhaps the first executive of a big company to consider building an entire semiconductor production facility due to the extreme complexities and costs associated with such a project. Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, already reacted to Musk’s musings, noting that the head of Tesla may be underestimating the challenge. “I think we may have to do a Tesla TeraFab,” Musk said. “It is like [TSMC’s] Giga[fab] but way bigger.” TSMC calls its fab complexes with production capacity from 30,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month ‘Megafabs’, whereas fab complexes with production capacities of over 100,000 WSPM are referred to as ‘Gigafabs.’ A ‘Terafab’ would mean capacity way beyond 100,000 WSPM, which would transform Tesla into one of the industry’s biggest chipmakers. To put the capacity into context: TSMC’s Fab 21 complex in Arizona — which will cost the foundry $165 billion in total — is expected to become a Gigafab with six fabs, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D center. Apparently, Musk is eyeing something bigger. But let us decode the whole story first, as it takes more than money to become a chipmaker these days. “Building advanced chip manufacturing is extremely hard,” Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, said at a TSMC event on Thursday. “It is not just build the plant, but the engineering, the science, and the artistry of doing what TSMC does for a living is extremely hard.” 3/5 Jensen on Elon Musk’s chip fab plan: “Building advanced chip manufacturing is extremely hard. It’s not just build the plant, but the engineering, the science and the artistry of doing what TSMC does for a living is extremely hard. $NVDA $TSLA $TSMNovember 7, 2025 As a major carmaker that also owns some of the industry's largest AI supercomputers, Tesla needs a steady supply of high-performance processors to power its artificial intelligence efforts. The company already uses tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, and now that its Dojo project has been cancelled, it plans to use its AI5 processors for cars and robots in its data centers as well. To get plenty of these processors, Tesla plans to double-source them from TSMC and Samsung. Musk also mentioned tapping Intel for chip production, though this might be a bit challenging as the company does not have any automotive-grade process technologies. “One of the things I am trying to figure out is how do we make enough chips,” Musk asked rhetorically during his keynote speech at the Tesla event. “So, I have a lot of respect for the Tesla partners, TSMC and Samsung, you know, maybe we will do something with Intel. We have not signed any deal, but it is probably worth having discussions with Intel.” However, he believes that his company will need more AI processors in the long term, which will necessitate building its own chipmaking operations, essentially becoming an integrated device manufacturer (IDM), a role that even established chip designers like AMD, Fujitsu, IBM, and Panasonic gave up in recent decades. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. “Even when we extrapolate the best-case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, it is still not enough,” Musk told the audience. “So, I think we may have to do a Tesla TeraFab. It is like [TSMC’s] Giga[fab] but way bigger. I cannot see any other way to get to the volume of chips that we are looking for, so I think we are probably going to have to build a gigantic chip fab. It’s gotta be done.” It costs leading-edge chipmakers billions of dollars to develop a fabrication process and tens of billions to build a single fab with a 20,000 WSPM capacity capable of making chips on a state-of-the-art process technology. Rapidus — Japan’s first new chipmaker with plans to build chips on advanced nodes in decades — estimates that it needs around ¥5 trillion (about $32 billion) in total investment to develop a process technology and build a fab capable of commercial production of 2 nm-class chips in 2027. While we can only applaud this ambitious project, it remains to be seen whether becoming a leading chipmaker from scratch is possible in the 2020s and with leading-edge nodes. Developing a new process technology from scratch is a particularly complex, multidisciplinary endeavor that takes 5 or more years these days, from inception to yield ramp. A development cycle of a fabrication technology begins with pathfinding, materials research, transistor structure development, and then running countless TCAD simulations to model doping, strain, and leakage for a new transistor. Rapidus has licensed its 2nm GAA transistor structure from IBM, but it is also possible to license a chunk of similar technologies from imec and CEA-Leti, public-private R&D institutes. But while it is hard to overestimate the importance of the right transistor structure, this is only the start. Once transistor technology is complete, engineers build thousands of tightly coupled process steps organized into FEOL, MOL, and BEOL modules — covering transistor formation, interconnects, and metallization. Each of these steps demands atomic-level precision in deposition, etch, lithography, and anneal. Tuning those steps (each with hundreds, if not thousands, of parameters) for manufacturability, uniformity, reliability, defectivity, power, and performance requires decades of engineering experience and time from the team. At this point, technology providers like IBM, Imec, or CEA-Leti cannot really help. Once each deposition, etch, implant, lithography, and anneal step is stable in isolation, engineers start combining modules (e.g., transistor gate stack and source/drain) on test wafers and tune their sequencing and temperature budgets to prevent cross-contamination or material degradation. This is essentially when the ordered stack of hundreds of steps that define the node — the process flow — takes shape. Again, these integration recipes are not available for licensing from R&D companies or institutes. After device performance, power, and yield meet targets, the process must be made design-usable by generating PDKs, SPICE models, verified standard-cell libraries for EDA tools, and IPs for chip designers. At the same time, engineers begin implementing the fabrication process in actual fabs and production lines. That implementation and setting the right parameters for equipment is another challenge that demands experience, not something money can buy. Finally, fabs must achieve high yields in mass production, which is a hard, long, and iterative process involving plenty of experienced engineers.Can this all be done from scratch in a mere five years by a newcomer?

Title: Disaster Ensues After AI Behemoth Floats Idea Of Stealing Your Tax Dollars If They Fail
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/11/06/openai-wall-street-journal-article-too-big-to-fail-bailout-china-tech-race/
Time Published: 2025-11-06T21:39:00Z
Full Content:
AI behemoth OpenAI tried to lay the groundwork for a taxpayer-funded bailout Wednesday and was met with swift condemnation. The Wall Street Journal published a story Sunday suggesting that OpenAI has now become “too big to fail.” In other words, if the company were to go under, it would be such a blow to the U.S. economy that the government would have to intervene and save it; otherwise, there might be a spiraling drain effect that sucks down the entire system. A domino effect from hell. OpenAI’s CFO, Sarah Friar, seemed to test-pilot the idea at a Wall Street Journal conference Wednesday, saying that the company wants to build up an ecosystem of banks, private equity groups, and a federal government “backstop” or “guarantee” to help build and finance the crucial data centers. (RELATED: Battle Against Data Centers Driving Up Electric Bills Unites Republicans, Democrats) There was swift backlash on social media, however, which forced OpenAI to do some cleanup. Friar later clarified her comment, saying that the mention of a “backdrop” muddied her point that “American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part.” OpenAI wants federal taxpayer backstop for new investments, per Bloomberg. CFO has clarified this was a “misspeak.” — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) November 6, 2025 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a long statement Thursday on X, claiming they are not looking for “government guarantees,” or a handout from Uncle Sam. I would like to clarify a few things. First, the obvious one: we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or… — Sam Altman (@sama) November 6, 2025 “First, the obvious one: we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market. If one company fails, other companies will do good work,” he said. Sam just wrote a 1,500-word essay explaining why he absolutely doesn’t want government guarantees… while outlining a $1.4 trillion moonshot that somehow needs them in spirit, if not on paper. It’s performance art at this point. 😂 He’s basically saying: “We don’t want… — Void Freud (@voidfreud) November 6, 2025 Altman went on to say that OpenAI has discussed government-subsidized loans to help build semiconductor factories in the U.S. “The one area where we have discussed loan guarantees is as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US, where we and other companies have responded to the government’s call and where we would be happy to help (though we did not formally apply),” Altman said. “The basic idea there has been ensuring that the sourcing of the chip supply chain is as American as possible in order to bring jobs and industrialization back to the US, and to enhance the strategic position of the US with an independent supply chain, for the benefit of all American companies. This is of course different from governments guaranteeing private-benefit datacenter buildouts,” he goes on. White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks joined the mop-up, as well. (Sacks is essentially Silicon Valley’s lobbying voice in the Trump White House.) There will be no federal bailout for AI. The U.S. has at least 5 major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place. — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 6, 2025 But, if there were a real market meltdown soon, why should we take these people’s statements that they don’t want a guaranteed federal bailout as true at face value? Clearly, they have been mulling over the idea. And it would be much easier to finance a mass buildout of data centers if investors knew that the federal government and taxpayers would ultimately foot the bill. In other words, if they knew the risk and downside of the whole AI bubble blowing up in their faces was passed on to the public. Altman recently got snappy when Brad Gerstner, an American investor, dared to ask him how OpenAI is going to pay for $1.4 trillion of long-term spending commitments on hardware and data center infrastructure from 2025-2035, even though the company’s revenue still is middling. “First of all. We’re doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer. I just, enough. I think there’s a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I think people who talk with a lot of breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever, that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we could sell your shares or anybody else’s to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply,” Altman claimed. Of course, the “people who are making the most noise on Twitter about this” just seem to be those with common sense, an ability to do basic math, and a growing skepticism that AI technology will actually be worth the investment. One MIT study found that 95% of organizations that have tried to implement generative AI, like OpenAI’s technology, ChatGPT, got zero in return. Another study from the Rand Corporation revealed that 80% of AI implementations fail. All of it is beginning to reek of … ‘Just give me more money, and this time, there will be a major breakthrough, and it will all be worth it. The best is yet to come!’ I don’t know exactly how many times Altman and other tech CEOs have said something to this effect over the years, but I know it’s more than once. And something of note: the famous investor who shorted the U.S. housing market ahead of the 08/09 financial crisis, Michael Burry, now has a short position on tech behemoths Palantir and Nvidia. He’s betting that these stocks are overvalued and will soon crash. 🚨 BREAKING: Michael Burry goes short on $PLTR and $NVDA in his latest 13F filing Scion Capital just bought put options on 1M Nvidia shares and 5M Palantir shares 👀 The Big Short is feeling bearish on AI pic.twitter.com/Kn6EcINm20 — Michael Burry Stock Tracker ♟ (@burrytracker) November 3, 2025 News of the trade sparked a big selloff in tech, as speculation that AI is a bubble ready to burst is running rampant.
