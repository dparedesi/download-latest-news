Title: Nebius Stock To $450?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/can-nebius-stock-keep-surging/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T09:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Approximately one year ago, AI-centric cloud company Nebius (NASDAQ: NBIS) was largely dismissed as a leftover from Russian technology. Emerging from a split with Yandex, Russia's leading internet firm, it appeared destined to remain on the periphery of global technology. Instead, it has orchestrated one of the most impressive comebacks in the sector. Since it began trading last October at $20 per share, Nebius has rallied to $89, elevating its market capitalization to over $21 billion – a 350% increase in just about twelve months. Unlike many "story stocks," this increase is rooted in fundamentals: revenues are projected to rise from $117 million in 2024 to an anticipated $568 million in 2025 and $1.5 billion in 2026. Further fueling the momentum, Nebius recently secured a landmark $17.4 billion agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to provide GPU infrastructure capacity over the following five years – validating its capabilities. Now, some of the biggest names in technology – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) – have built multi-trillion dollar valuations based on their cloud infrastructure. With AI now serving as the key growth driver in tech, we present an argument for how Nebius can leverage its exclusive AI focus to pave a path towards a valuation exceeding $100 billion in the upcoming years. Nebius is not a general-purpose cloud like AWS or Azure. It belongs to a new category of "Neoclouds" – infrastructure platforms designed exclusively for AI workloads, with computing, storage, networking, and management tools all optimized for training and operating large-scale AI models. While hyperscalers attempt to cater to everyone, Nebius concentrates on providing exactly what AI labs and organizations require most: high-performance, dedicated GPU infrastructure. The Microsoft agreement reinforces this strategy. The software giant has repeatedly encountered shortages in AI computing, exacerbated by its obligations to supply OpenAI. To bridge this gap, Microsoft will obtain dedicated capacity from a new Nebius data center in Vineland, New Jersey, starting later this year. From ChatGPT transforming how we operate and conduct research to AlphaFold accelerating drug discovery and generative tools reshaping creative workflows, AI is driving nearly every sector – and Nebius could be powering the essential infrastructure that enables it all. Before we delve into the specific figures for Nebius stock, let’s recognize a crucial reality. Investing in individual stocks, particularly in high-growth firms like Nebius, carries inherent volatility. While the potential for upside is significant, the journey can be tumultuous. That said, if you're looking for upside with reduced volatility compared to holding individual stocks, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently surpassed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns greater than 91% since its launch. This diversified strategy can offer exposure to high-quality growth firms while managing the risks associated with individual stocks. Now, with this context in mind, let’s explore what makes Nebius's unique narrative so compelling. Indeed, there is considerable competition in this industry, but Nebius sets itself apart in a few key ways despite the competitive landscape. Firstly, the company maintains a close partnership with AI chip frontrunner Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which manufactures the most advanced GPUs and essentially establishes industry benchmarks. Nvidia serves as both a significant partner and investor, having participated in a $700 million funding round last year and holds over 1 million Nebius shares. This partnership may provide Nebius preferential access to Nvidia’s most desired GPUs, such as the Blackwell super chips, granting it a vital advantage in a market where supply continues to lag behind demand. Another key differentiator is Nebius’s vertically integrated model. The company designs its own servers internally, bypassing OEMs and collaborating directly with manufacturers to cut costs, enhance performance, and quickly integrate the latest GPUs. This control accelerates deployment cycles and boosts efficiency — with infrastructure costs reportedly as low as $0.025 per GPU-hour. The company also provides transparent billing and imposes no lock-ins, making it particularly attractive to AI-first startups, where many innovations are taking place. This could help it better secure early customers. Let’s assess the scale of the opportunity. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads with an annual revenue run-rate exceeding $120 billion, while Microsoft’s Azure exceeded $75 billion in the previous fiscal year. AI workloads are even more compute- and memory-intensive, indicating that the AI cloud market may ultimately outstrip the current general-purpose cloud in terms of scale. The AI cloud segment is growing much more rapidly than the general-purpose cloud, as generative and automation use cases proliferate. Moreover, in contrast to hyperscalers, AI-centered clouds deploy specialized GPU clusters, liquid cooling, and tailored orchestration software, allowing for premium pricing, enhanced customer lock-in, and accelerated growth. The Microsoft agreement validates Nebius’s technology and could create opportunities for further partnerships with hyperscalers or enterprises. The numbers support the bullish perspective: consensus projections indicate revenue will increase from $568 million in 2025 to roughly $1.5 billion in 2026. Extending the trend, if Nebius compounds at 50% annually from 2026 through 2030, revenue could reach approximately $7.6 billion. Notably, the Microsoft contract alone could contribute over $3.5 billion annually by 2028, rendering the $7.6 billion figure possibly conservative. For context, Nebius currently trades at about 40× the estimated revenue for 2025. Even if this multiple contracts to 15× sales – which is not unusual for high-growth cloud infrastructure – that suggests a market cap of $114 billion. For comparison, Microsoft, valued at over $3.5 trillion, trades at nearly 12x sales, so this multiple should be reasonable for an earlier growth stage company like Nebius. With roughly 250 million shares outstanding, this translates to a stock price of around $459 per share by 2030. That represents an upside of more than 5x from the current stock price of $89. The bullish case for Nebius is predicated on the flawless execution of its significant Microsoft contract, ongoing preferential access to Nvidia’s most advanced GPUs, and financing rapid expansion without severely impacting its margins. Microsoft will also represent a disproportionate share of future revenue, leaving Nebius highly reliant on a single customer. Additionally, with the stock already trading at nearly 40× FY25 revenue – significantly above peers – any slowdown could adversely affect its valuation. It's also important to consider Nebius’s background and acknowledge its origins. The company was established as an offshoot of Yandex, Russia’s tech giant, and founder Arkady Volozh faced EU sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine, which made investors apprehensive. Since then, Nebius has fully severed ties with Yandex’s Russian operations and has relocated to Amsterdam with an international engineering team. The EU lifted its sanctions last year, alleviating most of the geopolitical concerns, though the company’s Russian roots remain a small residual risk. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven history of outperforming its benchmark that includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they offer a smoother investment experience, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Bitcoin Escaped Nvidia's Clutches, Is AI Next?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/15/bitcoin-escaped-nvidias-clutches-is-ai-next/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) supremacy in artificial intelligence accelerators has made it one of the most valuable firms globally, with a market capitalization exceeding $4 trillion. Its financial results have been robust, with revenue climbing 56% compared to the same period last year, reaching $47 billion in the last quarter, and net margins consistently surpassing 50%. However, history serves as a warning. In the world of cryptocurrency, GPUs once held the top position but were ultimately substituted by custom-made ASICs that provided greater efficiency. With Broadcom recently announcing a substantial $10 billion order for its specialized AI chips, reportedly from OpenAI, investors are starting to wonder if AI might follow a comparable path. What could this imply for Nvidia’s long-term future? Regardless of how fast-growing and enticing, putting money into a single stock entails significant risk. Trefis High Quality Portfolio aims to mitigate stock-specific risk while offering potential upside. When Bitcoin was initially introduced, mining occurred using standard CPUs. Shortly after, miners realized that GPUs were more adept at handling the parallel computations demanded by Bitcoin's algorithm. Eventually, GPUs emerged as the preferred hardware, only to be later overtaken by FPGAs and eventually ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). ASICs introduced a significant transformation. These chips, designed specifically for Bitcoin’s hashing algorithm, provided orders of magnitude more efficiency and speed compared to GPUs. A single ASIC miner could achieve terahashes per second (essentially, the rate at which a machine can execute these guesses), while using considerably less power than setups centered around GPUs. The downside was specialization: ASICs were limited to mining Bitcoin or similar algorithms, while GPUs could easily transition between different coins or even be adapted for gaming and AI. This led to a complete restructuring of the industry. Mining became capital-intensive and was dominated by large industrial entities capable of investing in extensive ASIC farms. GPUs remain popular among smaller miners, hobbyists, and those mining altcoins that resist ASICs or are tailored for GPU mining. Nvidia’s GPUs set the standard for training large language models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, and they support the majority of the AI infrastructure at hyperscalers. Over the past three years, tens of billions were invested in GPU clusters, driving Nvidia’s swift ascent. For perspective, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) anticipated spending a combined $364 billion in capital expenditures for their respective fiscal years. However, the economics surrounding AI may also be shifting. Training large models remains heavily reliant on GPUs, yet this is likely to be a relatively initial-heavy task. As the most readily available data on the Internet is utilized by LLMs (large language models) with diminishing returns from larger models, training growth could moderate somewhat. The majority of future demand is likely to be for inference – executing trained models at scale to respond to billions of queries. In contrast to training, inference is repetitive, reliable, and very sensitive to costs. This is precisely where custom chips could excel, just as ASICs did for Bitcoin. Related: Will Broadcom Chips End AMD Stock’s AI Dreams? The most compelling indicator emerged last week, when Broadcom announced a $10 billion order for custom AI chips from a singular client, widely thought to be OpenAI. If true, this could imply that OpenAI is relocating a portion of its inference operations away from Nvidia GPUs, likely in pursuit of improved efficiency and reduced costs. Broadcom’s CEO, Hock Tan, has underscored the rise of XPUs or custom accelerators, crafted for specific workloads. These chips could provide hyperscalers with greater control over their infrastructure costs while decreasing reliance on Nvidia’s high-priced GPUs. For OpenAI, whose ChatGPT serves millions of daily users, minor reductions in cost per inference could lead to substantial savings at scale. Having alternatives to Nvidia also enhances bargaining power for GPUs. The attraction of ASICs in both crypto and AI is evident: efficiency, lower energy consumption, and consistent performance for repetitive tasks. For firms operating AI workloads at large scales, these benefits may prove irresistible. However, there are downsides as well. Once produced, the functionality of an ASIC chip is mainly static, in contrast to GPUs which can be reprogrammed or upgraded. Just as Bitcoin ASICs were confined to the SHA-256 algorithm and vulnerable to protocol alterations, AI-specific chips may not possess the flexibility of GPUs. If AI models rapidly advance or architectures evolve, ASICs could become outdated. On the other hand, GPUs remain extremely adaptable, capable of managing both training and inference across diverse models. The design and manufacturing of custom ASICs is also expensive and time-intensive, potentially making them less accessible to smaller firms. For Nvidia, the risk is that its central growth driver – GPUs for AI – may not be as stable as it appears. While training tasks will likely continue to be dominated by GPUs, as the shift toward custom silicon for inference unfolds, Nvidia might experience a decline in demand. Broadcom’s agreement could signify the first step in a larger trend, as hyperscalers like Google, Amazon, and Meta contemplate similar approaches while additionally developing their own chips. Nvidia still benefits from ecosystem advantages and a comprehensive software platform (CUDA) that assists in better securing customer loyalty. Nonetheless, considering the high valuations and strong momentum, the threat posed by ASICs is one that investors should closely monitor. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a proven history of comfortably surpassing its benchmarks, which include all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk relative to the benchmark index, providing a smoother ride, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Alibaba's $100M Investment Fuels X Square Robot's Push For Embodied AI, Global Sales, And Next-Gen Humanoids

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. X Square Robot, a Shenzhen-based humanoid startup, secured approximately $100 million in funding led by Alibaba Group Holding BABA through Alibaba Cloud in a deal that strengthens the company's expansion in the robotics market. The latest investment brings the startup’s total funding to around $280 million across several financing rounds since launching in December 2023, X Square Robot Chief Operating Officer Yang Qian told CNBC earlier this week. HongShan, formerly Sequoia Capital China, joined the funding round alongside Meituan, Legend Star, Legend Capital, and INCE Capital. Qian confirmed the company is already generating revenue from sales to educational institutions, hospitality venues, and senior care facilities. Don't Miss: Venture capitalists are pouring unprecedented amounts into humanoid robotics as the integration of generative artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize human-machine interactions. X Square Robot exemplifies this trend, having completed eight funding rounds in less than two years of operation. “Right now we need robots to operate and complete complex tasks autonomously,” Yang told CNBC. She emphasized that after decades of developing robots capable of only limited functions like grasping objects, the industry has recognized that AI is essential for expanding machine capabilities. The company on Monday announced WALL-OSS, an end-to-end embodied foundation model, with code linked via GitHub and Hugging Face. The project focuses on vision-language-action alignment for manipulation tasks in real-world settings. Embodied AI here means models that perceive, reason, and act through physical systems such as robots. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share. X Square Robot also unveiled its Quanta X2 robot, featuring 360-degree cleaning capabilities with attachable mop heads and advanced hands capable of perceiving subtle pressure changes. According to CNBC, this represents a significant step toward more human-like functionality in commercial robotics applications. Currently, the company’s humanoid robots carry an $80,000 price tag according to research firm Humanoid Guide. Competitor Unitree offers a humanoid model for $16,000, though the advanced capabilities of that unit remain unclear. X Square Robot acknowledged it does not yet have a product ready for mass market delivery, with specific pricing determined by individual use cases, CNBC reported. Yang expects consumer adoption to accelerate once robot prices drop to approximately $10,000, achieved primarily through hardware cost reductions. She projects this milestone is achievable within three to five years, coinciding with the X Square Robot's prediction that “robotic butlers” will become reality within the same timeframe. See Also: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It The startup plans to begin preparing for an initial public offering next year, though Yang noted the company has not determined the listing location. X Square Robot is already expanding internationally, with ongoing discussions with potential customers in Japan and Singapore. Yang acknowledged that AI for robotics currently lags behind generative AI advancements in chatting and code generation. She estimates robotic AI technology will require at least 12 months to achieve ChatGPT 3.5-type capabilities, noting that “embodied AI” lacks clear benchmarks for measuring relative progress. While X Square Robot utilizes Nvidia NVDA chips for computing functions, other operations rely on less powerful automotive chips that can be sourced domestically within China, Yang told CNBC. This hybrid approach provides the company with supply chain flexibility as it scales operations to meet growing demand across educational, hospitality, and healthcare sectors.

Title: Goldman Sachs Warns An AI Slowdown Can Tank The Stock Market By 20%

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to all-time highs, but Goldman Sachs GS recently warned that once AI spending slows down, the stock market can tank by 20%. A research note from Goldman Sachs Analyst Ryan Hammond cited the danger of hyperscalers inevitably cutting back on AI expenditures, according to Fortune. "A reversion of long-term growth estimates back to early 2023 levels would imply 15% to 20% downside to the current valuation multiple of the S&P 500," Hammond reportedly wrote in his research note. Don't Miss: Right now, AI spending is full steam ahead, but Hammond wrote that a few analysts are assuming that a sharp deceleration will take place in Q4 2025 and 2026. Tech giants haven't gotten the memo. Meta Platforms META said this week it will spend $600 billion on AI over the next three years. Zuckerberg later posted on Threads that it's possible the company will invest more than $600 billion during those three years. He even said a "significantly higher number" was likely through the end of the decade. Microsoft MSFT made another big AI deal this week by securing a five-year, $17.4 billion AI infrastructure deal with Nebius NBIS. This type of rapid spending indicates AI growth can continue beyond the current rally. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share. Artificial intelligence plays a critical role in the stock market's performance based on the top companies in major benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Data from Slickchart shows that top AI beneficiary Nvidia NVDA makes up approximately 7% of the S&P 500. The top eight publicly traded corporations on the S&P 500 are all heavily invested in artificial intelligence. They are ramping up their AI spending and aim to release products and services that use AI. These eight companies make up more than 36% of the S&P 500. There are also corporate giants outside of the S&P 500's top 10 that still invest heavily in artificial intelligence. Oracle ORCL, Palantir PLTR, and Cisco CSCO are some of the most notable S&P 500 members in the category. Those three stocks make up more than 2% of the S&P 500 combined, and if they continue to outpace stocks with less of a focus on AI, then the technology's influence on the stock market will continue to grow. If the AI trade fades, many stocks will lose value and drag the S&P 500 considerably lower from its current levels. See Also: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It It's almost never a good idea to sell stocks just because of headlines or what an analyst says in a research note. However, Hammond reportedly brings up a point that some investors are ignoring. What if AI spending eventually slows down? There's only so much money and profits big tech can spend on AI, so growth rates will eventually have to decrease. It can still take a few years before a meaningful slowdown in the growth of AI spending, and decelerating growth rates don't necessarily translate into big tech pulling out of AI spending completely. Investors should consider the bullish and bearish points of any of their positions. While the stock market is exuberant on AI and its long-term potential, it's good to consider the possible downside of any slowdowns in AI spending.

Title: Stocks Reach Highs On Oracle And Fed Expectations
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/09/13/stocks-reach-highs-on-oracle-and-fed-expectations/
Time Published: 2025-09-13T15:38:14Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high last Thursday but declined fractionally on Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed with Oracle’s (ORCL) earnings further reinforcing the artificial intelligence (AI) growth narrative. Notably, banks performed well, which hints that the market is expecting a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut next week and a resilient economy. All signs point to artificial intelligence as being a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Indications suggest that the adoption of artificial intelligence is continuing at a rapid pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. This spending has created a virtuous cycle of spending and earnings for several mega-cap technology companies, including many of the Magnificent 7, which have seen their earnings and valuations flourish. While not included in the Magnificent 7, Oracle (ORCL) has quietly become a beneficiary of the seemingly insatiable current demand for AI training and the emerging demand for AI inferencing. Oracle’s management believes that its architecture enables better AI training at a lower cost for clients, providing a competitive edge. Additionally, their legacy database business enables Oracle’s clients to utilize their own data to offer AI inferencing, producing actionable insights, decisions, and predictions. AI inferencing is the crucial next step to AI demand and growth, since it is the use case for AI and expands the potential demand base to all corporations. Last week, Oracle announced a remaining performance obligation (RPO) of $455.3 billion, which can be thought of as an order backlog or contracted revenue that hasn’t yet been fulfilled. Oracle’s RPO grew by $317.5 billion quarter-over-quarter from AI-related contracts. This growth in RPO stems from multi-year contracts, so this revenue will likely be realized over a roughly seven-year period. In any case, analysts’ estimates now expect Oracle’s revenue growth to accelerate from 8.4% year-over-year for fiscal 2025 to 21.9% in 2027. While the exact margins and thus profits on this new business remain unknown, the apparent demand for their services sent the stock soaring by 25.5% last week. The supportive news from Oracle fueled the continued rally in many AI-related technology companies, with Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA) outperforming the S&P 500 handily last week. The August employment report saw payrolls grow by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Additionally, Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. Since then, on September 9, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released preliminary revisions to payroll data, showing that 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the twelve months through March 2025 than were initially reported. This record-breaking downward revision roughly halved the job growth estimate from previous projections. According to recent data, the four-week average of initial claims for unemployment benefits rose to near a year-to-date high. While the absolute level of initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits looks benign, the trend is moving higher. Continuing claims for benefits are also above the lows, indicating a slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. While the four-week average of initial claims for benefits is typically used to remove the volatility, the weekly claims were the highest in over three years. Consensus estimates suggest that the weekly claims will revert to roughly the four-week average level this week, as the spike last week was primarily due to filings in Texas. Following the weaker jobs data, a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting is a virtual certainty. Fed fund futures are pricing in a 100% chance of a rate cut this week. Beyond the cut this week, markets expect an additional two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts for the remainder of 2025. Bottom line: The September rate cut is widely expected, so that the focus will shift to expectations for future cuts. The Fed’s release of its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), along with Chair Powell’s comments, will be closely scrutinized for clues as to the expected pace of lower short-term rates. There are only five companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with FedEx (FDX) as the most notable for economic insights. August retail sales are scheduled for Wednesday. The US consumer has remained resilient, which is crucial for economic growth expectations, as consumer spending is the primary driver. Expectations are for some moderation from last month’s pace, but the data will be watched for signs that tariffs or the softening job market might be weighing on spending. Stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of banks and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. Further, the implied expectation is that the Fed will cut interest rates aggressively enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. While there are signs of deterioration in the labor market, there remains little evidence of an impending recession, and tech spending around AI is supporting rapid earnings growth in that sector. While the Fed will almost certainly cut rates this week, the implied future pace of easing might be slower than markets would like, which could result in increased stock volatility. Disclosure: Glenview Trust may hold stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Business Is Booming for Many Tech Giants. They're Laying Workers Off Anyway.

When business is surging, companies often expand their workforces to handle demand. That's not what's happening lately at some of America's biggest tech companies. Oracle's (ORCL) booming AI-driven backlog sent its stock to a record high this week—just weeks after reports the computing giant laid off hundreds of workers as part of an effort curb costs. Several other tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have shed jobs recently even as their revenues rose. (Oracle did not respond to a request for comment on the layoffs in time for publication.) The tech sector has been one of the heaviest hit by layoffs so far this year, second only to government jobs, according to a report from Challenger, Gray, and Christmas. And many of the industry's biggest companies are cutting from a large base: Data from online job board Indeed shows that listings for tech jobs peaked in 2022, outpacing the growth of available jobs in the economy at large, but that trend has reversed. Leading tech firms are trimming their ranks as demand for their services grows. Their swelling spending on AI data centers and hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) is one contributing factor, according to Wall Street analysts. AI expenditures are pushing tech leaders to cut costs elsewhere, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria has previously told Investopedia, driving many to cut staff or slow hiring to relieve pressure on profit margins. Some, he said, also expect to need fewer workers because of the technology. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June that he expects AI will likely lead Amazon to eventually operate with a smaller total headcount. He encouraged them to become more familiar with AI tools, suggesting that those who do could be better-positioned "to have high impact and help us reinvent the company." Economists at Goldman Sachs have estimated that about 6% to 7% of U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI. However, they're still optimistic about its effects on the job market, suggesting that losses could be "fleeting" and observing that job displacement due to labor-saving technological advances in the past have tended to fade after about two years. "We remain skeptical that AI will lead to large employment reductions over the next decade," they wrote. "Predictions that technology will reduce the need for human labor have a long history but a poor track record."

OpenAI said its nonprofit parent will have an equity stake exceeding $100 billion in the ChatGPT maker, making it "one of the most well-resourced philanthropic organizations in the world." OpenAI, which said the "recapitalization would also enable us to raise the capital required to accomplish our mission," also said it and backer Microsoft (MSFT) had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to extend their partnership, and were "actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement." OpenAI had initially announced plans last year to transform into a for-profit company, a condition for money it raised in funding rounds, including one where it raised $6.6 billion from investors including Microsoft and AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA). Becoming a for-profit company would allow OpenAI to make financial returns for its shareholders and also go public, marking a departure from its original mission of building open-source technology that wouldn't be subject to commercial priorities. Separately, Microsoft avoided a potentially massive antitrust fine from the European Union by striking a deal to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its popular office apps. The European Commission, the EU's enforcement arm, said it has accepted the moves by Microsoft to untie Teams from its productivity applications Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, included in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites for business customers. Microsft will now make these apps available to consumers without Teams at a lower price, allow customers tied to longer licenses to switch and let customers move their data out of Teams to use competitors. Microsoft shares, which entered Friday up by almost a fifth this year, are rising 1.4% in premarket trading.

Broadcom (AVGO) shares rallied to an all-time high this week as the chipmaker positions itself as a key competitor to AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The stock surged nearly 10% to a record close near $370 Wednesday, before pulling back slightly in Thursday's session. They've added more than half their value since the start of the year, with a close to 20% gain over the past five days alone, boosted by the company’s strong quarterly results, a new $10 billion customer, and the resurgence of the AI trade after Oracle (ORCL) reported a massive increase in its backlog. In a note to clients on Monday, Melius Research analysts said they expect Broadcom could gain about 30% of the AI compute market, while Nvidia’s market share falls over time. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels to watch after the stock’s recent bullish run. After retracing just below the 50-week moving average in March, Broadcom shares have staged an impressive reversal, with gains accelerating recently after the chipmaker’s quarterly results. While above-average trading volume has signaled buying conviction, the relative strength index warns of overbought conditions, with the indicator reaching a level that preceded major consolidation phases in the stock during late 2021 and mid-2023. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast how a long-term uptrend for Broadcom could play out, and also identify support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can use bars pattern analysis to project a potential bullish price target and speculate how high the stock could go from here. When applying the technique to Broadcom’s chart, we take the stock’s uptrend from May 2023 to June 2024 and overlay it from the start of last week’s bullish move. This indicates a period of consolidation for several months before a possible rally toward $680 by October next year, if price action rhymes with the prior trend. The earlier trend began with two weekly price bars that delivered a combined gain of 27%, compared to the over 20% cumulative advance of the two most recent weekly bars. During potential pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth tracking the $250 level. This area on the chart may provide support near the stock’s December and January twin peaks. Selling below this level could see the Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $185. Investors may seek entry points in this location near the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between June and November last year.

Title: Nvidia has finally won over one of its biggest Wall Street bears

It seems that Nvidia's success is too great for one of Wall Street's biggest bears to ignore. In an update to clients, DA Davidson raised its rating on Nvidia stock from "neutral" to "buy" and raised its price target from $195 to $210 a share. That implies around 18% upside from current levels. It also reflects a sharp change in sentiment from what the firm has previously said about the stock, with analysts predicting as much as a 48% drop in March. "Our increasingly optimistic view of the growth in AI compute demand supersedes our list of concerns regarding NVDA," analysts led by Gil Luria, the firm's head of technology research, wrote. In the past, Luria and his team warned that spending from hyperscalers—mega-cap tech firms that are shelling out billions to further their AI ambitions—could peak in 2026, which could significantly impact Nvidia's business. The use cases for AI also need to be more significant to justify how much money comapnies are pouring into Nvidia, they added. But things have changed over the last six months. In a note shortly after Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report, Luria said the firm's perspective on the stock had "shifted quite a bit" over the past half-year, thanks to the rapid development and adoption of AI among companies. Hyperscaler spending, meanwhile, doesn't look to be nearing a peak. "It does mean that the most important thing—the overwhelming growth in demand for compute—is the only thing that matters," Luria and other analysts wrote. "NVIDIA should be able to sustain growth over the next two years, regardless of which segment that growth comes from," he added. The majority of Wall Street analysts have issued "buy" ratings on Nvidia, even considering the stock's record-breaking run-up over the last several years. The AI chipmaker is up 32% year-to-date. Luria's team, though, said they would continue to keep an eye on several "cross-currents" they saw potentially working against the stock. Here are some of the factors on their radar: Jump to
