Gold (XAU), a traditional store of value but also a "non-productive" asset, has surged to a market capitalization exceeding $30 trillion in 2025, dwarfing digital gold, bitcoin, and U.S.-listed tech giants alike. The yellow metal's price per ounce has surged 66% to a record high of approximately $4,380, with prices rising 13% in October alone, according to TradingView data. This rally has pushed gold's market capitalization to about $30.42 trillion, based on an estimated above-ground global supply of 216,265 metric tonnes, as reported by the World Gold Council. Nvidia (NVDA), arguably the most consequential company globally due to its foundational role in powering the AI revolution, holds a distant second place with a market capitalization of $4.42 trillion. It is followed by Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (Google), silver, Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, bitcoin BTC$106.922,27, considered digital gold, ranked eighth with a market cap of $2.17 trillion. Gold's premium to tech giants doesn't necessarily reflect a positive outlook for the global economy because it is a non-productive asset. Unlike stocks, bonds, or real estate, gold does not generate dividends, interest, or rent, nor does it contribute directly to economic activity. Its price is directly tied to its appeal as a traditional safe haven and store of value asset as opposed to underlying cash flow or productive output. So, the fact that it trades at a significant premium to the most valuable tech companies is likely a telltale sign of economic malaise. It indicates that investors are seeking refuge in perceived safe havens amid broader economic uncertainty. Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel, recently expressed significant concern over the trend of investors viewing gold as a safer asset than the U.S. dollar, calling the yellow metal's record rally as cautionary signal about the U.S. economy's stability. According to analysis, the rally has been catalyzed by fiscal imprudence in the U.S. and across the advanced world, sticky inflation, geopolitical tensions and expectations for the Fed rate cuts. The consensus is for the uptrend to continue. Features that describe gold as a non-productive store of value also apply to bitcoin. However, while gold's price has rallied sharply this year, surging over 60%, bitcoin has gained a more modest 16% in 2025. Industry observers are optimistic that when the gold rally eventually cools, investment funds may rotate into the relatively cheaper digital store of value.

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. If you’ve read any market news lately, you’ve likely seen OpenAI all over the headlines. First, a $100 billion investment from NVIDIA. Then, 5 new data centers through partnerships with Oracle and SoftBank, which are part of a larger $500 billion initiative. The key takeaway? Massive amounts of capital are flowing into the AI race. Of course, AI investments are not new, even if the magnitude of each investment seems to rise with each announcement. The influx of capital begs the question, “how can investors take advantage of the AI race when most technology stocks are already overvalued?” Finding an AI stock that isn’t already overvalued is extremely difficult in today’s market. Difficult, but not impossible. To find value in the industry, one must look at the infrastructure behind AI. Behind the flash and hype sit massive, power-hungry data centers that require enormous amounts of energy. My Long Idea this week is a company that’s well positioned to benefit from the AI data center driven energy demand. The company has industry leading profitability, multiple development agreements in place, and its stock is cheap, unlike most AI tech stocks. It’s not news that the ongoing race to build massive, power-hungry, data centers will drive strong energy demand in the coming years. It’s also not news that most of the stocks involved in AI and related industries have seen their values explode higher. So, my scoop is that I found a great stock that benefits from AI, but it has been overlooked and remains Attractive. This week’s Long Idea, Black Stone Minerals L.P. (BSM), is well positioned to collect royalties all along the way. I first made Black Stone Minerals a Long Idea in November 2023, and reiterated my bullish opinion on the stock on October 2024. Since my original report, the market has failed to recognize the company’s strong position to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. My original investment thesis on this company remains intact and increasing AI spending makes future growth prospects even more attractive. Nvidia (NVDA) recently announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to help it build data centers to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA’s systems for OpenAI’s AI infrastructure. What does a deal this big mean for energy consumption? Brian Sullivan of CNBC notes 10 gigawatts is equal to the power generated by: This partnership between Nvidia and OpenAI is just one of many examples of AI and data centers driving huge energy demand. McKinsey projects that by 2030, worldwide data centers will require $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures just to keep pace with the demand for compute power. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects electricity demand from data centers will more than double by 2030, to ~945 terawatt-hours (TWh), which is slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan. Natural gas is an increasingly attractive power source for two main reasons: reliability and efficiency. Reliability is paramount for data centers, as outages can result in millions of dollars in lost revenue and significant reputational damage. Natural gas offers a safeguard against traditional energy risks including grid instability, intermittent power supply, and extreme weather events. Unlike diesel, which is constrained by limited on-site storage and supply chain vulnerabilities, natural gas is delivered continuously via pipelines, which ensures a steady supply even during extended grid outages. Additionally, natural gas can be quickly turned on and off and has much lower ramp times than solar and wind power. When selecting a power source, efficiency is also very important to keeping costs low and margins in the green. To measure efficiency, one can analyze an energy source’s capacity factor, which measures the actual energy produced relative to the maximum possible energy that could have been produced if operating at peak capacity. Solar power typically operates at capacity factors between 10% and 25%, while power generated from wind, hydroelectric, coal, and wood sources operate at capacity factors of around 34%, 35%, 43%, and 56%, respectively. Natural gas – combined cycle on the other hand has an average capacity factor of 60%, with some uses, such as combined heat and power (CHP) systems fueled by natural gas operating at capacity factors of 80%. The only energy source that operates at a higher capacity factor then CHP natural gas systems is nuclear energy, at 92%. The United States is the largest natural gas producer in the world, and the companies that own stakes in natural gas assets are particularly well-positioned to meet the rising needs of data center power consumption. More specifically, Black Stone Minerals’ management believes “gas-powered electrical generation will cause the next 10 to 15 years of the gas market to not be perfect, but more reliable than it’s been over the past 15 years.” Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports present another large driver of demand for U.S. natural gas production. LNG provides transportation advantages through the process of liquefying natural gas, which reduces it to 1/600th of its original volume. U.S. LNG exports have nearly quadrupled over the last five years, and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts U.S. LNG exports will increase 36% from 2024 to 2026. Furthermore, the EIA projects U.S. monthly natural gas production to grow from 112.9 billion cubic foot (Bcf) in December 2024 to 115.1 Bcf in December 2026. See Figure 1. Figure 1: U.S. Monthly Natural Gas Production: 2010 – 2026 U.S. weekly oil production has increased from 9.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in September 2015 to 13.5 million bpd in September 2025. Since October 2023, output has consistently ranged between 13.0 and 13.5 million bpd. See Figure 2. The EIA projects that U.S. oil production will remain stable near these record levels, averaging 13.4 million bpd in 2025 and 13.3 million bpd in 2026. Figure 2: U.S. Oil Production: September 2015 – September 2025 Black Stone Minerals holds mineral rights to 20+ million gross acres across 41 states and 60+ productive basins. According to the company’s September investor presentation, in 2Q25 BSM maintains rights to 11% of the 571 total rigs in the U.S. This exposure is spread across all of the major onshore producing basins, which include Haynesville/Bossier, Permian, Bakken, and Eagle Ford basins. See Black Stone Minerals’ acreage presence by region in Figure 3. Figure 3: Black Stone Minerals’ Acreage by Major Basin in 2024 Black Stone Minerals’ management team is taking steps to expand its already large asset base to capitalize on growing natural gas production. In May 2025, Black Stone Minerals entered into a development agreement with Revenant Energy for 270,000 gross acres across the company’s Haynesville/Bossier acreage in the Shelby Through region. Through deal, the annual well commitments escalate over five years from a minimum of 6 wells per year starting in 2026 and scales to a minimum of 25 wells per year. When discussing the agreement on the company’s 2Q25 earnings call, Black Stone Minerals’ CEO noted “these new developments, coupled with our existing agreements, are expected to more than double our drilling obligations in the area over the next 5 years, providing significant natural gas growth for the partnership.” The company also finalized an amendment with Aethon Energy which will release over 50,000 gross acres back to Black Stone Minerals in the Shelby Through. These agreements build on the company’s ongoing Haynesville Expansion (HEX) initiative, which extends development in the Shelby Trough and geologically connects to the Western Haynesville. As part of the HEX, the company’s Kurth Lake Expansion (KLX) encompasses 220,000 gross acres with an annual well commitment that escalates from a minimum of 1 well per year starting in 2026 to a minimum of 12 wells per year through 2035. To summarize, Black Stone Minerals is adding about 50 wells and 50,000 acres of to boost its natural gas production capacity over the next ten years. As I highlighted in my previous reports, Black Stone Minerals generates revenue by leasing its mineral and royalty interests in oil and gas properties across the U.S. The company does not bear the costs or operational risks associated with drilling or maintaining wells. Instead, it leases its rights to exploration and production (E&P) companies, which assume the associated expenses and risks. This business model allows Black Stone Minerals to benefit from rising natural gas and oil production in a much more stable and predictable manner compared to E&P companies. While profits are down from record 2022 levels, Black Stone Materials continues to generate strong Core Earnings and free cash flow (more on that later). Black Stone Minerals generated $245 million in Core Earnings in the TTM ended 2Q25, which is higher than any other year in my model except 2022 and 2023. Black Stone Minerals has grown revenue by 1% compounded annually and Core Earnings by 7% compounded annually since 2015. See Figure 4. More recently, the company’s net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) margin improved from 48% in 2019 to 64% in the TTM, and in turn its return on invested capital (ROIC) improved from 11% to 17% over the same time. Figure 4: Black Stone Minerals’ Revenue and Core Earnings: 2015 – TTM Black Stone Minerals’ rising free cash flow (FCF) remains impressive. It gives the company the means to expand production and support an increasing level of capital return to shareholders as highlighted below. The company generated a cumulative $1.9 billion in FCF while paying $1.6 billion in combined distributions ($1.5 billion) and common unit repurchases ($23 million) since 2020. Black Stone Minerals generated a cumulative $2.4 billion (78% of enterprise value) in FCF from 2018 through 2Q25. See Figure 5. Figure 5: Black Stone Minerals’ Free Cash Flow: 2018 – 2Q25 Black Stone Minerals reduced its total debt from $399 million in 2019 to $100 million in the TTM. The company earns an Attractive Credit Rating in part because of its reduced debt load and consistent cash flows. Black Stone Minerals earns a Very Attractive rating in four of the five criteria that drive my Credit Ratings. Even if economic conditions deteriorate, the company’s strong financial footing secures its operations for the foreseeable future. Figure 6: Black Stone Minerals’ Credit Rating Details Black Stone Materials’ superior profitability compared to its peers reflects just how strong the oil and gas royalty business is. Per Figure 7, Black Stone Minerals generates the highest ROIC and NOPAT margin of its peer group. The peer group, detailed in Black Stone Minerals’ proxy statement, includes California Resources (CRC), Gulfport Energy (GPOR), Northern Oil & Gas (NOG), Magnolia Oil & Gas (MGY), and more. Figure 7: Black Stone Minerals’ Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM Black Stone Minerals has consistently returned capital to shareholders for nearly a decade. The company increased its regular distribution from $0.08/unit in 2Q20 (lows of COVID-19) to $0.30/unit in 3Q25. When annualized, the current regular distribution provides investors a 9.3% yield. From 2020 through 2Q25, Black Stone Minerals paid $1.5 billion (56% of current market cap) in regular distributions. Black Stone Minerals also repurchases units, though in lower amounts relative to distributions. Black Stone Minerals repurchased a total of $23 million in units since 2020. As of June 30, 2025, the company had $150 million remaining in repurchase authorization. Should the company continue repurchasing units at TTM levels moving forward, it would repurchase units worth 0.1% of its current market cap. When combined with distributions, investors could see a yield of 9.4%. Oil prices declined in the first half of 2025 due to weakening global demand amid changes in trade policies and escalating trade tensions, alongside a significant supply increase as OPEC+ members unwound voluntary production cuts and non-OPEC+ producers increased output. The company’s realized oil and condensate price was $67.07/Bbl in 1H25, compared to $77.35/Bbl in 1H24 and $98.34/Bbl in 1H22. Lower oil prices drove the company’s oil and condensate sales down 27% YoY in 1H25. Oil prices are forecasted to continue to decline into early 2026, which will continue to put pressure on Black stone Minerals’ oil and condensate sales. However, rising natural gas prices have offset the decline in oil prices. The company’s realized natural gas price was $3.66/Mcf in 1H25, compared to $2.39/Mcf in 1H24. The increase in prices drove natural gas and NGL sales 33% higher YoY in 1H25. Total revenue in 1H25 increased 2% YoY. Furthermore, natural gas prices are projected to rise going into next year, from $2.91 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in August 2025 to $4.30 MMBtu in 2026. The good news is even if natural gas prices were to increase less than expected or oil prices were to fall, any downside to profits is already more than priced into Black Stone Minerals’ current stock price. At its current price of $13/share, Black Stone Minerals has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.7, which means the market expects its profits to permanently fall 30% from current levels. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to quantify the cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for BSM. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: BSM would be worth $13/share today – equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, Black Stone Minerals’ NOPAT would fall 3% compounded annually through 2034. For reference Black Stone Minerals has grown NOPAT by 7% compounded annually since 2015. If I instead assume: BSM would be worth at least $20/share today – a 54% upside to the current price. In this scenario, Black Stone Minerals’ NOPAT would grow just 1% compounded annually over the next decade. Should Black Stone Minerals grow profits more in line with historical rates, the stock has even more upside. Figure 8 compares Black Stone Minerals’ historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above DCF scenarios. Figure 8: Black Stone Minerals’ Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios

BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Nvidia's financial performance has been extraordinary, making it the most valuable U.S. company at a $4.4 trillion market cap.Its market dominance stems can be attributed to the company's leadership, it's high-powered chips and a comprehensive, full-stack AI infrastructure strategy.Despite its stock run-up, valuation metrics indicate Nvidia may still be undervalued given its strong growth potential. A $1,000 investment in Nvidia (NVDA) five years ago would be worth more than $12,000 today. The chipmaker’s stock has enjoyed a remarkable run, fueled by surging demand for its high-powered GPUs amid the AI boom. This wasn’t a hype-driven rally. The stock never got ahead of its fundamentals; if anything, investors were late to recognize what Nvidia had been quietly building for years. When AI’s moment arrived, Nvidia was ready to embrace it. Over the last five years, Nvidia executed two stock splits: On Oct. 14, 2020, Nvidia closed at $14.05 on a split-adjusted basis. That means a $1,000 investment would have bought 71 shares. As of Oct. 14, 2025, Nvidia closed at $180.03 per share, making those 71 shares worth $12,782.13—a more than 12x return, and that’s excluding any dividends received along the way. For comparison, a $1,000 investment in the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 index, would have grown to $1,986.69 in the same period. The takeaway? Whether you held or missed out, Nvidia’s return has been extraordinary. What drove this exponential return? Nvidia’s strategic pivot — repurposing its powerful graphics chips for AI workloads — proved transformational as AI became a dominant investment theme after OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022. Though AI had been evolving for decades, ChatGPT made it tangible, accessible and personal for the mainstream.. Nvidia positioned itself at the center of the AI narrative, capturing demand from cloud providers, data centers and enterprises racing to build next-generation infrastructure. In May 2020, Nvidia launched the A100, the first GPU based on its Ampere architecture. Delivering up to 20x performance improvements over the previous generation Nvidia GPU, A100 quickly became the gold standard for AI. Major customers included Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle. After the launch, NVDA shares rose from $8 in mid May to end the year at $13.02, representing a gain of 63% Nvidia stock ended 2021 at $29.36, gaining 125% from the previous year’s close, as the Covid-ridden world embraced high-performance computing for remote work, gaming and data analytics. Demand from crypto mining also contributed to stock gains. In April 2021, Nvidia announced the general availability of Omniverse Enterprise, a 3D simulation platform for creating digital twins and virtual worlds. A key attribute of the Omniverse is to create physically accurate visualizations and simulations of products and environments, reducing the time and costs of physical testing. Nvidia announced its first Hopper-architecture-based GPU, the NVIDIA H100, in 2022, calling it “the engine of the world’s AI infrastructure.” The H100 was designed to be deployed in every type of data center, including on-premises, cloud, hybrid-cloud and edge. While investor response to the H100 announcement was initially muted, the GPU would prove to be a critical enabler of large-scale AI workloads in the following years. ChatGPT’s release on Nov 30, 2022, marked an inflection point for AI. Nvidia stock jumped 8% that day — an early sign that the market was beginning to recognize Nvidia’s potential. However, by the end of the year, the Nvidia stock retraced to 2020 levels, wiping out its 2021 gains. A major reason was the crypto market crash, which significantly reduced demand for Nvidia’s gaming GPUs used by miners. The same year, Nvidia faced yet another setback when the U.S. government introduced controls to prevent the chipmaker from exporting its most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100 GPUs to China, threatening a solid revenue stream. The explosion of investment in generative AI in 2023 led to a surge in demand for AI infrastructure. With its H100 GPUs already in production, Nvidia became a clear beneficiary.. Both institutional and retail investors piled into the AI theme and Nvidia’s stock more than tripled over the year, closing 2023 near $50. Nvidia also crossed $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time. The momentum carried into 2024. As major tech companies allocated billions of dollars to expand their AI capabilities, Nvidia's datacenter revenues soared. At its annual GTC conference in March 2024, Nvidia unveiled its next-generation Blackwell GPU platform, reinforcing optimism about its roadmap. In June 2024, Nvidia executed a 10-for-1 stock split to increase accessibility for investors. Later that year, Nvidia was added to the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average – a recognition of its market leadership. Nvidia’s financial performance has been equally impressive. The AI bellwether more than doubled its revenues for fiscal 2024 and then doubled its revenues again in fiscal 2025 in rapid succession. Positive investor sentiment drove record inflows into the stock, making Nvidia the most valuable company in the U.S. with a $4.4 trillion market cap. Recently, CEO Jensen Huang confirmed that the exponential demand for AI computing, particularly for the newer Blackwell GPUs, showed no signs of slowing down. With Nvidia stock setting new highs, some analysts are even forecasting a potential future valuation of $7 trillion, despite setbacks with China and intensifying competition from AMD. Nvidia’s decision to repurpose its graphics chips for AI was nothing short of visionary. Recognizing that the parallel processing architecture originally designed for rendering complex graphics was also perfectly suited for the intense computational demands of AI – marked a pivotal turning point and redefined the company’s future. The introduction of the Compute Unified Device Architecture in 2006 is Nvidia’s most significant differentiator. CUDA provided software tools that allowed developers to program Nvidia GPUs for general computing tasks beyond graphics. Thus Nvidia built a robust software ecosystem around its hardware. This early move created a durable competitive moat, fostering developer loyalty and driving long-term platform adoption. It meant that researchers and developers building AI models were already accustomed to Nvidia's software and hardware long before the AI boom truly kicked off, positioning Nvidia as the default choice for AI infrastructure. Unlike its competition, Nvidia focuses on building the entire AI infrastructure. Its end-to-end AI platform encompassing GPUs, CPUs, networking hardware, and full-stack software gives it the capability to build AI supercomputers, while enabling customers to deploy AI with greater ROI. Nvidia’s ability to deliver new GPU architectures with significant performance gains — such as Ampere, Hopper and Blackwell — has kept it consistently ahead of the curve. The company’s rapid iteration has made it the go-to provider for customers racing to keep pace with the computing demands of generative AI and large language models. Nvidia’s financials have been growing at a faster pace in recent fiscal years, leading to the sharp rise in its share price. Revenues have grown from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023 to $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024 and to $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025. The growth in revenue has been accompanied by strong profitability. Operating income has grown from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $32.9 billion in fiscal 2024 to $81.5 billion in fiscal 2025 and earnings per share from $0.17 in fiscal 2023 to $1.19 in fiscal 2024 and to $2.94 in fiscal 2025. Nvidia has shown remarkable resilience, enduring the 2022 crypto crash that severely impacted its gaming segment and the current US-China trade tensions. China has been a key market for Nvidia; it represented $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened from 95% before 2022 to just 50% after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China over national security concerns. Instead of resisting policy constraints, Nvidia adjusted swiftly by introducing the H20, a watered-down version of its H100 GPU designed for U.S. compliance — demonstrating its agility in navigating complex regulations. With China turning away from its chips now, Nvidia is accelerating expansion into new markets, again highlighting its resourcefulness. Huang’s leadership remains Nvidia’s greatest asset. The visionary chief executive touted the transformational potential of AI long before it went mainstream and prepared Nvidia to be at the heart of the AI buildout boom. As a founder-CEO, he brings continuity, long-term strategic vision and assertiveness to steer Nvidia through a complex technological and geopolitical situation. Huang’s pragmatic leadership has been on display repeatedly: He lobbied effectively to ease U.S. restrictions on H20 chip exports, yet accepted China’s subsequent rejection of Nvidia’s H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips with composure. Chinese regulators have reportedly directed companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to cancel orders for Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D processors, which are specifically designed to comply with U.S. export rules and serve the Chinese market. Instead of dwelling on the setback, Nvidia shifted strategy — assuming a “China zero” baseline in financial guidance and treating any China-related sales as potential upside rather than expectation. The recent U.S. approval to sell AI chips to the UAE drove Nvidia stock to new highs, and a deal to sell directly to OpenAI, bypassing traditional cloud partners — reflects the company’s evolving sales strategy. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s strategic investment in Intel points to initiatives to diversify manufacturing sources beyond TSMC, as Taiwan faces an ongoing geopolitical threat of invasion from China. This proactive de-risking underscores Huang’s forward-looking approach that continues to set Nvidia apart. Nvidia still has a long growth runway extending into the next decade. Last month, Nvidia unveiled Rubin CPX, a new class of GPU designed to handle million-token coding and generative video applications. Rubin CPX is offered in multiple configurations, including the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX , which Nvidia says will enable companies to generate $5 billion in token revenue for every $100 million invested. Rubin is on schedule for volume production next year. Over the next five years, Nvidia expects to scale into a $3-4 trillion AI infrastructure opportunity with its Blackwell, Rubin and other successors. The AI infrastructure market continues to expand significantly with $600 billion in data center and computing-power investments expected this year. The key drivers for these investments include reasoning agentic AI that would require a lot of computing power, global build outs for sovereign AI, enterprise AI adoption, and the arrival of robotics and physical AI. Blackwell has set industry benchmarks for AI inference ROI. As agentic and reasoning-based models gain traction, inference workloads are scaling across sectors, positioning Blackwell as a core growth engine. Nvidia claims that its Blackwell platform delivers the highest ROI at AI factory scale and can generate $75 million in token revenue over three years from a $5 million investment. Token revenue is earned during an AI system’s inference phase, where it processes input tokens and generates output tokens to produce responses. The faster and more efficiently it handles each token, the greater the potential revenue the system can generate. Nvidia’s RTX Pro servers enable enterprises to build AI factories and accelerate enterprise workloads from agentic AI and LLM inference to industrial AI and digital twins. About 90 companies have already adopted RTX Pro servers, including Hitachi, which uses these for real-time simulation and digital twins, Lilly for drug discovery, Hyundai for factory design and AV validation and Disney for immersive storytelling. RTX Pro servers are expected to become a multibillion-dollar product line as enterprises modernize data centers. Sovereign AI has emerged as a growth pillar, as nations seek to build in-country AI infrastructure using Nvidia’s full-stack. Nvidia is working on Sovereign AI initiatives across The UK and Europe. The European Union plans to invest €20 billion to establish 20 AI factories in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, including five gigafactories to increase its AI infrastructure tenfold. Isambard-AI, deemed as the UK’s most powerful AI supercomputer, is powered by Nvidia. This supercomputer aims to accelerate breakthroughs in fields of drug discovery and climate modeling. Nvidia expects to achieve over $20 billion in sovereign AI revenue this year, more than twice its revenue last year. Networking, which is shaping up as a critical contributor for Nvidia, fetched second quarter revenues of $7.3 billion, up 98% year-on-year and up 46% sequentially. Strong demand across Spectrum X Ethernet, InfiniBand, and NVLink spurred the strong growth. Spectrum X, which is the world’s first Ethernet networking platform for AI, is now annualizing over $10 billion in revenue, accelerating from an $8 billion annual run rate in the first quarter. THOR, Nvidia’s new robotics computing platform is seeing early adoption from leading players like Meta, Amazon Robotics, Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, Figure, Hexagon and Medtronic. Robotic applications require exponentially more computing power and infrastructure, representing a significant long-term demand driver for Nvidia’s data center platform. Last but not the least, Nvidia’s near-term outlook looks upbeat. It sees third-quarter revenues of $54 billion, plus or minus 2% – implying a range of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion compared to the consensus of $53.1 billion. This is higher than the $46.7 billion in revenues it generated for the second quarter. The outlook assumes no H20 shipments to China. So, does Nvidia look like it’s slowing down? Even at record highs, Nvidia’s stock may not be as overvalued as it appears. Several valuation metrics suggest there’s still room for upside: These metrics suggest that, despite its impressive run-up, Nvidia stock may still be undervalued relative to its historical and sector benchmarks. Nvidia stock isn’t trading on hype The market is pricing in its AI leadership and perhaps even under-pricing the scale of its opportunity. Despite a hefty $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia remains deeply embedded in the multitrillion-dollar AI infrastructure cycle that continues to unfold. Nvidia isn’t some accessory to AI buildout, it is the backbone of the process. The company’s financial results continue to validate this growth narrative, with sustained momentum across key segments. Competition from AMD cannot be brushed off, but Nvidia’s full-stack advantage remains difficult to replicate. China is a near-term setback, but Nvidia is already expanding into other international markets. Nvidia’s dominance in data centers, sovereign AI initiatives and enterprise AI point to a multi-year growth runway. The recent dip in Nvidia stock presents a buying opportunity, in my opinion. Despite a nearly 1,200% surge over the past five years, Nvidia’s growth shows no signs of fatigue. No stock, including Nvidia, has a straight upward trajectory and periods of volatility are inevitable. However, pullbacks in Nvidia stock could offer attractive entry points for investors with a long-term view. As the buildout of AI infrastructure continues to accelerate, Nvidia stock appears well-positioned to set new highs. How much would $1,000 invested in NVDA five years ago be worth now? A $1,000 investment in Nvidia shares five years ago would now be worth more than $12,000, excluding dividends. What was the main driver of Nvidia's stock price growth? Nvidia’s early and strategic positioning at the center of the AI boom — serving cloud providers, data centers, and enterprises racing to build next-generation infrastructure — fueled its extraordinary gains. Is Nvidia still a good investment today? As the buildout of AI infrastructure continues to accelerate, Nvidia stock appears well-positioned to set new highs, thanks to its dominant market share, cutting-edge technology and expanding end markets.

Title: Why NVIDIA Stock Rose 80% In 6 Months?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/16/why-nvidia-stock-rose-80-in-6-months/
Time Published: 2025-10-16T12:23:47Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 77.2% change in NVIDIA (NVDA) stock from 4/18/2025 to 10/15/2025 was chiefly motivated by a 48.4% change in the company’s P/E Multiple. While there is more to this narrative than mere numbers, let’s first analyze the stock price movements by examining its contributing elements. Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet a significantly diversified approach offers great value, such as the one we adopt with Trefis High-Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in a single stock you like or create a portfolio designed for success across market cycles? Our data illustrates that the High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking uncertainties into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is integrated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth manager and Trefis partner – whose asset allocation framework produced positive returns during the 2008-09 timeframe when the S&P declined by more than 40%. Returning to the “change”: the alterations in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenues, and profit margins have an underlying narrative regarding business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed crucial developments that affected the stock price movement for NVDA stock. Before that, as a brief background: NVDA provides graphics, computing, and networking solutions for the gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive sectors globally, in addition to a strategic partnership with Kroger Co. Opinion: We currently consider NVDA stock appealing yet volatile. Why is that? Take a look at the complete narrative. Read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock to understand what drives our current view. Risk: That said, Nvidia isn’t exempt from significant declines. It dropped 68% during the Dot-Com bubble and suffered an even steeper decline of 85% during the Global Financial Crisis. During the inflation shock, it declined approximately 66%, while the corrections in 2018 and the Covid pandemic pulled it down by 56% and 38%, respectively. Even with strong fundamentals, Nvidia’s history indicates it can incur steep losses when market conditions turn. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor – particularly given the volatility linked with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four-year period. What is the reason for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have historically yielded better returns with less risk when compared to the benchmark index; showcasing a more stable performance as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Full Content:
AI darling Nvidia just struck another big data center deal—this time as part of a group with Microsoft, BlackRock, and others. A consortium including BlackRock (BLK), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) said Wednesday it would buy AI data center infrastructure company Aligned Data Centers in an agreement valued at $40 billion. Aligned Data Centers is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing data center firms, and the group said the purchase “will fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure.” The massive deal could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand expectations, with Nvidia, Microsoft, and BlackRock making big bets on AI-driven growth. The deal marks the latest in a string of high-profile agreements and partnerships for AI chip leader Nvidia, and infrastructure deals for BlackRock, which has been eying energy providers as another way to ride the AI boom. BlackRock CEO and AIP Chair Larry Fink said that with the acquisition, “we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth.” Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft pared back early gains and were down about 1% in recent trading. Shares of BlackRock were less than 1% lower. This article has been updated since it was first published for clarity and to reflect more recent stock price values.

Title: What Chipmaking Equipment Giant ASML's Q3 Results Said About AI Demand, China Trade
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-chipmaking-equipment-giant-asml-q3-results-said-about-ai-demand-china-trade-11830006
Time Published: 2025-10-15T15:55:20Z
Full Content:
Chipmaking equipment supplier ASML says it's upbeat on AI demand, even in the face trade policy headwinds. The Netherlands-based firm said it doesn't see its 2026 sales falling from 2025 levels even though it expects sales in China to “decline significantly,” thanks in part to strong demand for its machines to make chips supporting AI data centers. CEO Christophe Fouquet said the company has seen “continued positive momentum around investments in AI, and (has) also seen this extending to more customers.” U.S.-listed shares of ASML (ASML) were up about 3% in recent trading. Shares of other companies in the semiconductor industry, including Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Lam Research (LRCX), also gained after a down day for the sector yesterday. As one of the world’s leading suppliers of chipmaking equipment, ASML's results can be taken as a signal of whether chipmakers are feeling confident in the future of their businesses. ASML reported third-quarter earnings per share of 5.49 euros ($6.38), above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though its revenue of 7.52 billion euros ($8.74 billion) missed. Fouquet said ASML sees current-quarter sales of between 9.2 billion and 9.8 billion euros ($10.7 billion and $11.4 billion), above the analyst consensus, and that the company plans to provide more details on its 2026 outlook in January. With Wednesday's gains, ASML shares have added 46% in 2025 so far.

Title: Will You Be Comfortable Buying Nvidia Stock?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Do you already hold Nvidia stock? You may want to think about retaining it. Are you planning to buy in? This could be your opportunity. Nvidia has emerged the most important semiconductor player in the AI space, driven by its advanced GPU architectures that form the backbone of AI training and inference workloads across industries. The stock has surged 30% this year, and remains up about 90% from its April 2025 lows. Reflect on the following information. While we prefer to buy dips if the fundamentals are strong — for NVDA, see Buy or Sell NVDA Stock — we remain cautious about falling knives. Particularly, it’s essential to determine whether, if conditions worsen and NVDA declines another 20-30% to $126 levels, we could maintain our position in the stock. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. Interestingly, the stock has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during several economic downturns. We evaluate this based on both (a) how much the stock declined and (b) the speed of its recovery. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a broader diversified strategy that we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Let us pose this question: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed — the S&P 500, the S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework helps stack the odds in your favor. Here are the specifics, but first, as a brief background: NVDA offers graphics, compute, and networking solutions for gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets worldwide, in strategic partnership with Kroger Co. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic 2018 Correction 2008 Global Financial Crisis Concerned that NVDA may drop significantly further? You might want to explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks renowned for comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which encompasses all three — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What’s the reason? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index; providing a smoother investment journey, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
