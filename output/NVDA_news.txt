(Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) See more on Trefis.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Feb. 26, 2025, after the market closes. The semiconductor leader currently holds a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia reported revenue of $113 billion, with operating profits of $71 billion and a net income of $63 billion. The stock’s reaction post-earnings will largely depend on how the results and future outlook align with investor expectations. Analyzing historical performance can be beneficial for event-driven traders: either by understanding past trends to position themselves before the earnings release or by examining the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings to make informed trades the day after the announcement. Specifically, past data suggests the maximum positive one-day movement post earnings, was a little over 20%. Full analysis below. Separately, see our counter scenario on – Nvidia’s 50% Downside. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that Nvidia is a pretty volatile stock. Over the past five years, there have been 20 earnings reports, with 11 positive and 9 negative one-day returns, indicating positive 1D returns approximately 55% of the time. This percentage increases to 58% when considering data from the last three years. The median of the 11 positive returns is 4.9%, while the median of the 9 negative returns is -5.9%. Additional data for observed returns 5-days (5D) and 30-days (30D) post-earnings are summarized in the table below. NVDA returns 1 day, 5 days, and 30-days post earnings A potentially less risky strategy (though its effectiveness depends on the strength of the correlation) involves understanding the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns post-earnings. Identifying pairs with the highest correlation can guide trading decisions. For instance, if 1D and 5D returns exhibit the highest correlation, a trader might consider a "long" position for the next five days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data based on five-year and three-year (more recent) histories. Note that "1D_5D" refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns At times, the performance of peer companies can influence a stock’s post-earnings reaction, with market adjustments potentially beginning before the earnings announcement. The table below presents historical data comparing Nvidia post-earnings performance with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings 1D returns. Peer stocks post-earnings one day (1D) return Not too happy about the volatile nature of NVDA stock?

Title: What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks about DeepSeek
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-thinks-deepseek-ai-q4-earnings-1851765905
Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:37:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA+0.21%) chief executive Jensen Huang doesn’t have hard feelings for Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. After the Hangzhou-based AI startup spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company — amid a global selloff of tech stocks. In December, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 of Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips to train its DeepSeek-V3 model — much less than the tens of thousands of more advanced Nvidia chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. The AI startup’s models, which it demonstrated to be on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META-1.52%), prompted questions over the tens of billions of dollars its U.S. rivals are spending on cutting-edge chips and AI infrastructure. During an interview with DataDirect Networks chief executive Alex Bouzari, Huang said he thinks DeepSeek’s reasoning models, R1, which it released in January ahead of the stock rout, will lead to more demand for computing power, because reasoning is “fairly compute intensive.” “I think the market responded to R1 as in ‘Oh my gosh, AI is finished. It dropped out of the sky, we don’t need to do any computing anymore,’” Huang said. “It’s exactly the opposite.” Huang also noted that R1 is “the world’s first reasoning model that’s open-source,” meaning developers and consumers can freely use it. “It is so incredibly exciting, the energy around the world as a result of R1 becoming open-sourced. Incredible,” Huang said. Earlier this month, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM-1.07%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. Therefore, Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia is expected to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings next week.

David Howse, president of the California College of the Arts (CCA), delivered grim news last summer to his faculty and students: given rapidly declining enrollment, the college’s future was in serious peril. Less than a year later, the nonprofit arts college has received a lifeline thanks to the philanthropy of Nvidia (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The Jen-Hsun (Jensen Huang’s Chinese name) and Lori Huang Foundation, founded by Huang and his wife nearly two decades ago, is donating a staggering $22.5 million to the San Francisco-based school—the largest gift in its history. The donation matches additional funds raised from other individuals and entities connected to either the college or local arts and tech communities, giving the CCA a total of nearly $45 million to address its financial struggles. Huang’s foundation “saw an opportunity both to support CCA in this time of need and also to challenge others to rise to the moment,” said Howse in a statement. Like other nonprofit arts colleges across the U.S., CCA has faced mounting challenges in recent years amid a dramatic drop-off in enrollment exacerbated by demographic factors and the Covid-19 pandemic. In August, the school announced a series of cost-cutting measures, such as layoffs, as it faced a $20 million deficit. Besides addressing its deficit, CCA said its new funds will be earmarked for program launches and future fundraising opportunities. The school was founded more than a century ago and focuses primarily on art, architecture, design and writing; offering 22 undergraduate and 10 graduate programs. Huang is currently the world’s 11th richest person with an estimated net worth of $121.8 billion—an achievement enabled largely by Nvidia’s dominance in today’s A.I. boom. The chipmaker’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have become a rare commodity amongst tech developers scrambling to power their A.I. products, with companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL) pouring billions of dollars into Nvidia’s sought-after hardware. While the bulk of the Huang Foundation’s donations have been funneled into donor-advised funds, a type of philanthropic savings account utilized by the wealthy, the nonprofit has also supported a number of educational institutions over the years. In 2023, for example, it gave $10 million to Oregon State University (OSU), which both Huang and his wife Lori attended. The couple previously pledged $50 million to their alma mater in 2022 to build a supercomputing complex. And in 2008, they gave $30 million to help establish an engineering center at Stanford, where Huang received a degree in electrical engineering back in 1992. The billionaire’s donations have additionally benefited the Oneida Baptist Institute, a Kentucky boarding school he attended that received $2 million from Huang in 2019. While CCA isn’t one of the Nvidia founder’s alma maters, the art school’s alumni are well-connected across Silicon Valley. Graduates are frequently pursued by the likes of Google and Apple (AAPL), according to the school. Huang’s foundation “recognizes the essential intersection of technology, art and design in driving innovation,” said Eric Jensen, chief operating officer of the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation, in a statement. “Our investment in CCA reflects our commitment to supporting institutions that cultivate the creative leaders of tomorrow.” Huang isn’t the only tech billionaire injecting capital into arts education across Silicon Valley. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, led a nonprofit’s acquisition of the San Francisco Art Institute last year. The school, which will now house an artist residency program, went bankrupt in 2023—making CCA San Francisco’s last standing nonprofit arts college.

Title: Satya Nadella Unveils Microsoft’s Quantum Breakthrough: a New State of Matter

For a field that many have long considered decades away, quantum computing sure is getting a lot of buzz in Silicon Valley. Yesterday (Feb. 19), Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled a quantum chip known as Majorana 1, created with an entirely new state of matter that’s beyond solid, liquid and gas. “Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a post on X yesterday. “We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. While traditional computing currently relies on bits, quantum computing utilizes qubits—a unit of information that can operate in multiple states simultaneously, instead of being either on or off. To build qubits, most quantum companies use superconducting units. But for decades, Microsoft has taken a notably unique approach. Majorana 1 contains eight qubits created with a new state of matter the company calls a “topological state,” a feat achieved by combining both semiconductors and superconductors. These topological qubits are “faster, more reliable and smaller,” providing a clearer path to eventually fitting a million qubits on a single chip, according to Nadella. Researchers have spent decades studying the feasibility of a so-called quantum computer, which could tackle calculations beyond the wildest capabilities of today’s supercomputers. Quantum computing is still a way off from becoming commercially viable, but recent research progress has heated up the tech industry’s race to develop quantum computers—a milestone that could have major implications for everything from the health care industry to supply chains and climate change. A one-million-qubit quantum computer is largely considered the threshold for delivering real-world results, Microsoft said. Due to their ability to draw from quantum mechanics, such machines could solve problems across chemistry and materials science that are impossible with current computing capabilities. Potential results could include discovering why materials crack, a breakthrough that could lead to self-healing materials; or creating a way to break down all types of plastic. “Most of all, quantum computing could allow engineers, scientists, companies and others to simply design things right the first time,” Microsoft said. Microsoft isn’t the only Big Tech company attempting to crack the quantum computing. Decades of research from companies like IBM, Intel and Google (GOOGL) has seemingly begun to pay off. Most recently, Google sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley when it unveiled a new quantum chip called Willow. In less than five minutes, the computer was able to perform a standard benchmark computation that would take today’s supercomputers 10 septillion years—a number that surpasses the age of the universe—to complete. But not everyone is convinced that true breakthroughs are just around the corner. Tech leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang have raised red flags about the technology’s timeline. In January, Huang sent quantum stocks tumbling after declaring that “very useful quantum computers are still a few decades away.” Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed these concerns a few days later while speaking on Joe Rogan’s podcast. “My understanding is that’s still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm,” Zuckerberg said. Nadella is more optimistic. Microsoft’s new advancements mean the company could be the first to achieve milestones like a one-million-qubit chip and thousands of error-corrected qubits, said the CEO during an episode of the Dwarkesh Podcast yesterday. “And then it’s game on. You suddenly have the ability to build a real utility-scale quantum computer,” he said. While it’s under Nadella’s leadership that Microsoft is finally edging closer to reaping the rewards of such research, its quantum computing strategy started back in the 2000s—long before Nadella joined the company. “It’s unbelievable,” Nadella said of the effort, which has taken place under previous chief executives like Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. “I’m the third CEO of Microsoft who’s been excited about quantum.” Despite the long waits they generate, such projects are key to the success of Microsoft’s research division, according to Nadella. “We’ve got to go at it each year knowing that most of these bets are not going to pay off in any finite frame,” he said. “Maybe the sixth CEO of Microsoft will benefit from it.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Nvidia's new AI tool can teach sign language
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-signs-asl-american-sign-language-ai-tools-learn-1851765619

Nvidia (NVDA+0.21%) is launching an artificial intelligence-powered platform for learners of American Sign Language — the third-most prevalently used language in the U.S. Together with the American Society for Deaf Children and creative agency Hello Monday, Nvidia developed an interactive web platform called Signs to support ASL learning. The platform will also provide a dataset validated by fluent ASL users and interpreters that developers can use to build more accessible AI applications. Signs features a library of ASL signs for learners to improve their vocabulary, as well as a 3D avatar teacher. Learners can get real-time feedback on their signing via an AI tool that analyzes webcam footage. The platform initially has 100 signs, and is focused on hand movements and finger positions. Users can also learn the meanings of different facial expressions and head movements. Nvidia said it wants to grow the signs library to 400,000 video clips for 1,000 signed words. Signs users can contribute to the video dataset, which is open-source. The company added that it plans to make the dataset available to the public for building accessible AI agents, video conferencing features, and other AI tools. “Most deaf children are born to hearing parents. Giving family members accessible tools like Signs to start learning ASL early enables them to open an effective communication channel with children as young as six to eight months old,” Cheri Dowling, executive director of the American Society for Deaf Children, said in a statement. “And knowing that professional ASL teachers have validated all the vocabulary on the platform, users can be confident in what they’re learning.” The company is currently working with the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research to improve the platform, and is looking to include regional and slang terms in the Signs library. The dataset will be released sometime this year, Nvidia said, and the ASL learning service is live now. Meanwhile, Nvidia is preparing for its annual GPU Technology Conference in March, where attendees can also use Signs. The company is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings next week.

Title: Here Is What Wall Street Analysts Are Forecasting About NVIDIA’s GB200, B200, And NVL Rack Server Shipments Ahead Of The Earnings Next Week

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Wall Street analysts remain split on the extent to which NVIDIA's slower production ramp-up of the GB200 GPU would end up affecting its upcoming earnings and the outlook for the year ahead. While Baird analyst Tristan Gerra is dismissive of all "lingering concerns around [the] GB200 mix for the year," his counterpart at HSBC is much more cautious, lowering his forecast for NVL rack server shipments for the year from 35,000 units to 30,000 units. To wit, Baird analyst has leveraged his supply chain meetings to note that GB200 shipments are now finally gaining momentum after a "late and slow start." In what is a critical tidbit, Gerra notes that apart from "architectural novelties" that took time to optimize, the GB200 GPUs were also initially constrained by the available data center infrastructure (electricity/space). The analyst goes on to note: "Investors should not assume that these initial delays will lead customers to skip to the next-generation products. We expect GB200 to represent the majority of NVIDIA's GB mix in 2H25 and into 2026. GB300 crossover is expected not until 2H26." Meanwhile, as mentioned above, HSBC analyst Frank Lee is much more cautious on NVIDIA, going so far as to take the rare step of lowering his stock price target for the GPU manufacturer from $185 to $175, while maintaining an overall 'Buy' rating. Lee believes GB200's "supply chain issues" could remain an "overhang going into H1FY26." Bear in mind that NVIDIA's fiscal year concludes in January, hence its mismatch with the December-ending calendar year. Coming back, Lee has now lowered his "FY26e NVL rack server assumption from 35k to 30k [units]," while noting that NVIDIA will be able to "offset the slower GB200 ramp with upside in B200 GPU shipments in H1 FY26e," enabling the company to still "book Blackwell revenues of cUSD5bn and cUSD10bn in 4QFY25 and 1QFY26, respectively, leading to total revenue of USD40bn/42.2bn in 4QFY25/1QFY26 vs consensus of USD38.2bn/USD42bn." As for the upcoming earnings, Lee expects NVIDIA to show $40 billion in total sales for Q4'25 against a company-guided figure of $37.5 billion and Wall Street's consensus estimate of $38.2 billion. The HSBC analyst concludes his note with the following projection: "We also expect 1QFY26/2QFY26 sales of USD42.2bn/USD55.4bn vs consensus of USD42bn/USD46.2bn, implying H1 FY26 is unlikely to disappoint the market despite ongoing supply side issues." Elsewhere, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh concedes that "manufacturing constraints are limiting shipments of GB200 NVL server racks," but predicts that "this will be more than offset by the following: 1) given the lower initial manufacturing yields of GB200 NVL, we believe customers have been able to push out orders of GB200 and backfill with HGX-based B200 servers with x86 head nodes; 2) DeepSeek, as well as limited supply of Huawei’s Ascend AI ASIC, has created a surge in demand for H20 GPUs from China CSPs; 3) we believe NVDA’s customers, esp CSPs, are financing its inventory at EMS providers, so effectively sell-in shipments from NVDA to EMS are recognized as revenues." Finally, we bring you Oppenheimer's investment note on NVIDIA, where analyst Rick Schafer projects that the demand for H200 GPUs remains stronger than expected and will constitute ~30 percent of the company's sales mix this year. On the GB300 GPU, Schafer notes: "We believe GB300 (expected late CY25) likely a single rack (NVL72) configuration, suggesting DC cooling kinks being ironed out." The Oppenheimer analyst goes on to note that "DeepSeek [is] a positive for NVDA as CSPs rapidly integrate innovations into Western models." Schafer also thinks that the CapEx of hyperscalers will be up 40 percent this year to over $300 billion vs. the $220 billion figure for 2024. And, in what aligns with our previous post on the topic, Schafer thinks AI ASICs will coexist with GPUs: "CSP custom AI ASIC projects coexist with GPUs, in our view—ASICs primarily used for internal workloads while GPUs used for broader, dynamic, higher performance AI applications. NVDA remains best positioned in AI, benefiting from full-stack AI hardware/software."

Title: Microsoft says it’s found the missing piece in quantum’s puzzle

Microsoft (MSFT-0.90%) is changing what you learned about the states of matter in elementary school with a creation that it said will advance “the path to useful quantum computing.” As part of what it calls the “year to become Quantum-Ready,” the company unveiled its first quantum computing chip, Majorana 1, built with “topological superconductors” or “topoconductors” — a “breakthrough” material that enabled the company to create a new state of matter called “topological superconductivity.” Quantum computers typically use quantum bits — or qubits — which are usually electrons, photons, or another subatomic particle. Connected together, qubits have far more processing power than binary 0s and 1s that classical computers use. Unlike classical binary bits, qubits can be 0 and 1 at the same time in a state called superposition. The more qubits that are used, however, the more errors usually occur in a computation. Microsoft claims its solution to reducing those errors lies in the topoconductors. Unlike familiar solids, liquids, and gases, this new state of matter occurs when electrons pair up and flow with zero resistance while being protected by special mathematical properties that make them extremely stable. The new state of matter, which Microsoft has worked on for almost two decades, makes it possible for quantum systems to scale to one million qubits on a single, hand-sized chip, the company said, adding that it has demonstrated the world’s first topological qubit and already placed eight on Majorana 1. At one million qubits, a quantum computer could perform far more difficult calculations than traditional computers with higher accuracy. “[Q]uantum computing at this scale could lead to innovations like self-healing materials that repair cracks in bridges, sustainable agriculture, and safer chemical discovery,” Chetan Nayak, corporate vice president of quantum hardware at Microsoft, said in a statement. “What today requires billions of dollars in exhaustive experimental searches and wet-lab experiments could be found, instead, through calculation on a quantum computer.” Because these specially protected qubits are smaller, faster, and more reliable than traditional qubits, Microsoft said it could build a working prototype of an error-free quantum computer in just years rather than decades. The company calls this a “fault-tolerant prototype” or FTP. “Imagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not,” Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella wrote on X. “This is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe.” Despite the excitement, Microsoft customers won’t be able to use the Majorana 1 chip through its Azure public cloud, CNBC (CMCSA+0.23%) reported, as Microsoft continues its research with national laboratories and universities. Quantum computing stocks climbed off of the announcement, with D-Wave Quantum (QBTS-4.83%) shares jumping more than 8%, Quantum Computing (QUBT-4.67%) rising 7.8%, and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-3.12%) shares up almost 5%. Earlier this year, quantum stocks plunged after both Nvidia (NVDA+0.21%) chief executive Jensen Huang and Meta (META-1.65%) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg cast doubts about the technology’s near-term potential. During the chipmaker’s financial analyst day at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Huang said useful quantum computers are likely decades away. “If you said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,” Huang said. “If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.” However, Nvidia announced that it will host its first Quantum Day at its GPU Technology Conference in March. Nvidia will also unveil quantum computing “advances shortening the timeline to useful applications,” the company said.
