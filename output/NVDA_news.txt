Investing Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) surged 8% on earnings as Trump announced 25% AI chip tariffs. TSMC manufactures 90% of advanced chips from Taiwan. NVIDIA (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) manufacture all AI chips through TSMC in Taiwan. Both face margin compression without pricing power for 25% cost increases. Qualcomm and Apple face lower exposure than pure AI chipmakers. Qualcomm makes mobile chips while Apple only consumes chips internally. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Trump’s 25% tariff on AI chips landed the same day Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) posted blowout earnings and dismissed AI bubble fears. TSMC’s stock surged 8% Thursday, pulling AMD up 12% and NVIDIA 3% in sympathy. Now investors face a critical question: which chip stocks are most exposed when the tariff hits? The policy targets AI chips specifically, with exemptions still being negotiated. What matters: manufacturing location, supply chain concentration, and revenue mix. Here are the five stocks ranked by tariff exposure, from most vulnerable to least. TSMC sits in the crosshairs. The company manufactures 90% of the world’s advanced chips from Taiwan, the geographic epicenter of tariff risk. With $3.63 trillion in trailing revenue and 59.4% gross margins, TSMC has enormous profitability to protect. A 25% tariff on Taiwan-manufactured chips hits TSMC’s customers (NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm, Apple) first, but the pain cascades back to the foundry. The company just raised 2026 capital expenditure guidance to $56 billion, signaling confidence in AI demand. CEO C.C. Wei told analysts that AI infrastructure spending would drive 30% revenue growth this year. That confidence now collides with tariff uncertainty. TSMC’s Arizona fabs won’t save it near-term. The Phoenix facilities are ramping 4nm production, but represent a fraction of total capacity. Most AI chips, NVIDIA’s H100s and H200s, AMD’s MI300 series, still come from Taiwan. If exemptions favor domestic manufacturing, TSMC faces a brutal choice: accelerate costly US expansion or watch customers shift orders to Samsung’s Korean fabs. The stock trades at 34x trailing earnings with a $1.70 trillion market cap. Institutional ownership sits at 16.3%, meaning any tariff-driven guidance cut triggers significant portfolio rebalancing. Thursday’s 8% rally on earnings looks precarious if tariff details disappoint. NVIDIA designs chips in California but manufactures them in Taiwan via TSMC. That makes every H100, H200, and upcoming Blackwell chip subject to tariff risk. The company generated $187 billion in trailing revenue with 70% gross margins—margins that can’t absorb a 25% cost increase without either raising prices (killing demand) or compressing profitability (tanking the stock). CEO Jensen Huang has emphasized that AI infrastructure buildout is a multi-trillion-dollar, multi-year cycle. Gartner forecast $2.5 trillion in AI spending for 2026, with 49% allocated to infrastructure. NVIDIA captures the lion’s share. But if tariffs force hyperscalers to delay purchases or negotiate price cuts, NVIDIA’s 63% operating margins become a target. The stock’s 2.3 beta means it amplifies macro shocks. Thursday’s 3% gain on TSMC’s earnings beat shows the market still believes in the AI story. But at 45x trailing earnings and $4.46 trillion market cap, there’s limited room for tariff-induced margin compression. Exemptions for AI infrastructure could save NVIDIA—if the company can prove its chips are critical to national competitiveness. AMD’s 12% Thursday rally reflects its position as NVIDIA’s closest competitor in AI chips. The MI300 series is gaining traction in data centers, with Q3 revenue up 36% year-over-year to $9.2 billion. But AMD faces the same TSMC dependency as NVIDIA. Its chips are manufactured in Taiwan. The difference: AMD has less pricing power. Where NVIDIA commands 80-85% gross margins on AI chips, AMD’s overall gross margin sits at 51.7%. A 25% tariff hits AMD harder because it can’t pass costs to customers as easily. The company is already fighting for market share against an entrenched competitor; tariff-induced price increases would make that battle steeper. AMD’s $364 billion market cap and 1.95 beta make it more volatile than NVIDIA. The stock trades at 117x trailing earnings but just 36x forward earnings, reflecting expectations for rapid profit growth. Tariffs threaten that narrative. If AMD can secure exemptions for its data center chips—arguing they’re essential to competing with NVIDIA—the stock could outperform. Otherwise, margin compression looms. Qualcomm’s exposure is more nuanced. The company designs mobile processors and 5G chips, not AI accelerators. That puts it outside the tariff’s primary target. But Qualcomm still manufactures chips via TSMC and Samsung, creating indirect exposure. The company generated $44.3 billion in trailing revenue with 26% operating margins, lower than NVIDIA or AMD. Mobile chip markets are more price-sensitive than data center AI, so Qualcomm has limited ability to pass tariff costs to smartphone makers. The stock dropped 11% over the past week, suggesting investors are already pricing in tariff risk. Qualcomm’s saving grace: its chips aren’t explicitly AI-focused. If exemptions target AI infrastructure, Qualcomm might avoid the worst impact. But if tariffs apply broadly to all Taiwan-manufactured semiconductors, the company faces cost headwinds without the pricing power to offset them. Apple is the least exposed. The company doesn’t manufacture AI chips for external sale. Its custom silicon (A-series, M-series) powers iPhones, iPads, and Macs. While those chips incorporate AI features, they’re not sold as standalone AI accelerators. Apple’s $3.84 trillion market cap and consumer electronics focus insulate it from AI chip tariffs. The company’s supply chain includes TSMC-manufactured processors, but tariffs would hit Apple as a cost of goods sold issue, not a revenue threat. With 47% gross margins and $416 billion in trailing revenue, Apple can absorb incremental costs better than pure-play chip manufacturers. The stock is down 5% year-to-date, underperforming the semiconductor rally. That divergence reflects Apple’s limited direct AI exposure. It’s not riding the AI infrastructure wave like NVIDIA or AMD. Tariffs reinforce that positioning. TSMC and NVIDIA face the most acute tariff risk. One manufactures in the tariff zone, the other depends entirely on that manufacturing. AMD follows closely, with less pricing power to offset costs. Qualcomm and Apple sit further down the exposure curve, either because their chips aren’t AI-focused (Qualcomm) or because they’re end consumers rather than chip sellers (Apple). Thursday’s rally on TSMC earnings shows investors still believe in AI demand. But tariff exemptions will determine whether that demand translates to profits. Watch for guidance cuts if exemptions disappoint, especially from TSMC and NVIDIA. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/15/2026 1:46:22 PM PST by SoConPubbie SUPPORTING AMERICA’S SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Proclamation invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (Act) to address national security concerns with respect to imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products.The President directed the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to jointly negotiate agreements, or continue any current negotiations of agreements, to address the threatened impairment of the national security with respect to imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products from any country.The President also imposed a 25% tariff on certain advanced computing chips, such as the NVIDIA H200 and AMD MI325X. This tariff will not apply to chips that are imported to support the buildout of the U.S. technology supply chain and the strengthening of domestic manufacturing capacity for derivatives of semiconductors.In the near future, President Trump may impose broader tariffs on imports of semiconductors and their derivative products, as well as an accompanying tariff offset program to incentivize domestic manufacturing as previously announced.ADDRESSING THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY: President Trump recognizes that restoring capacity for domestic production of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products is critical for economic and national security.This action follows the Secretary of Commerce’s completion of a Section 232 investigation under the Act, which found that the present quantities and circumstances of the imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products threaten to impair national security.The United States’ capacity to produce semiconductors, certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment such as advanced lithography and etching tools, and their derivative products is insufficient to meet domestic demand. This has led the United States to be dependent on foreign sources to meet domestic demand. Semiconductors are essential to the United States’ economic, industrial, and military strength, and a disruption of import-reliant supply chains could strain the nation’s industrial and military capabilities.Today’s action will address the threat to national security by, among other things, incentivizing domestic production of semiconductors and reducing our nation’s reliance on foreign sources and foreign supply chains.BUILDING ON A RECORD OF SECURING CRITICAL INDUSTRIES: This Proclamation builds upon previous actions taken by the Trump Administration to ensure U.S. trade and industrial policies put America first.On Day One, President Trump established his America First Trade Policy to make America’s economy great again.President Trump has repeatedly used Section 232 tariffs to protect against threats to our national security and to strengthen manufacturing sectors critical for our national and economic security, including steel, aluminum, copper, autos, and lumber.Throughout his first year back in office, President Trump has announced many historic international trade deals to defend domestic production while expanding market access with America’s partners.

Title: TSMC's Strong Earnings Sparked a Tech Stock Rally Thursday. What Does It Mean for the AI Trade?

Full Content:
Record earnings from contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) sparked big stock gains Thursday, suggesting there's still gas in the tank to fuel the AI rally. TSMC on Thursday reported record quarterly profit of 505 billion new Taiwan dollars ($16 billion) on record revenue of more than NT$1 trillion ($33.1 billion). Both figures were well ahead of consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts. TSMC's U.S.-listed shares were up more than 5% in late-afternoon trading. Wall Street's response to TSMC's results underscored investors' appetite for evidence of AI-driven growth. Shares of chipmaking equipment providers Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA Corp. (KLAC) soared 7% and 8%, respectively, pacing S&P 500 advancers, after TSMC forecast it would increase its spending on equipment and infrastructure by at least 25% this year. The AI trade stumbled in the finals months of 2025 as investors questioned the sustainability and wisdom of Silicon Valley's massive AI spending. Those concerns were on the back burner Thursday when TSMC's record results reinforced high expectations for companies with significant exposure to the AI data center buildout, including chip designers and data storage device makers. TSMC's earnings and spending plans also signaled healthy demand for AI chips, boosting the stocks of designers such as Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO). Wall Street's attitude toward AI has shifted over the past year. When once investors were happy to reward companies for their AI ambitions, Wall Street is increasingly looking for evidence that AI investments are delivering tangible financial benefits. “As the investment cycle continues to mature, markets are likely to exemplify greater emphasis on monetization and earnings in 2026,” wrote Wedbush analysts in a research note on Thursday. Wedbush expects the market will be led this year by companies that can demonstrate AI-related spending is improving cash flows or profit margins. That shift has produced a widening divide between the tech sector's haves and have-nots. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) is up 12% since the start of the year, propelled higher by stocks like Micron (MU) and Lam Research Corp (LRCX), whose top and bottom lines are being bolstered by AI demand. Shares of data storage device maker Sandisk (SNDK) have risen about 70% since the start of the year—more than double the return of the S&P 500’s next-best performing stock—amid insatiable demand for the storage and memory solutions required to operate the most powerful AI models. Meanwhile, concerns about AI monetization have weighed on shares of software giants Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW) and Adobe (ADBE), which some investors worry may struggle to fend off AI-native competition and adapt their pricing models to a new tech paradigm.

Investing RBC initiated Nvidia with a $240 target, citing $500B+ backlog and surging enterprise demand. Barclays upgraded Dell to overweight on AI server order strength and expanding enterprise opportunities. Rosenblatt initiated Quantum Computing with a buy rating, citing legitimate quantum assets across multiple domains. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Analysts at RBC just initiated coverage of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) with an outperform rating and a $240 price target. The firm cited NVDA’s $500 billion+ backlog, inferencing demand, and surging enterprise demand as reasons for further growth. In addition, analysts at Rothschild Redburn reiterated a buy rating on NVDA with a price target of $268. The firm believes NVDA will remain a positive outlier with regard to size, growth, and profitability. They also believe its moat will continue to become even stronger than expected. Technically, NVDA just broke above its 50-day moving average to the upside. From here, if it can break above resistance at around $193.63, it could retest $200. Analysts at Barclays just upgraded Dell (NYSE: DELL) to an overweight rating, citing strength in Dell’s AI server orders, stability of its AI operating markets, and expanding opportunities in enterprise server and storage. The firm maintained its price target of $148 a share. “We are more positive on DELL given the strength in AI server orders, stability of AI op margins, expanding opportunities in enterprise server and storage, and DELL’s consistent disciplined opex management,” they added, as quoted by CNBC. After finding strong double bottom support at $115, Dell is just starting to pivot higher. Last trading at $123.18, we’d like to see it initially retest $130 a share. Analysts at Rosenblatt just initiated a buy rating on Quantum Computing (NASDAQ: QUBT). The firm noted the company “has legitimate quantum assets across photonics, compute, security, and sensing as well as burgeoning thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) fabs that could supply both their and industry needs for integrated quantum photonics, nonlinear optics, and optical waveguides,” as quoted by CNBC. We also have to remember that this powerful technology is set to revolutionize industries from healthcare and finance to cybersecurity and energy — solving problems that today’s fastest supercomputers can’t touch. Quantum computing may even be able to help advance artificial intelligence, machine learning, financial modeling, cybersecurity, batteries, and even help with the green energy boom.

January 15, 2026 09:20 ET | Source: ReelTime Media ReelTime Media Seattle, WA, Jan. 15, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ReelTime Media (OTCID:RLTR) today announced that its Reel Intelligence (“RI”) platform has reached a new milestone, becoming the first fully integrated, multi-modal artificial intelligence platform capable of converting a single 2D image into a rotatable 3D model that can be exported for 3D printing. RI Goes 3D Anyone can Try RI Now for free at www.tryrinow.com and experience it themselves. ReelTime stated that RI’s latest advancement enables users to take one image and automatically generate a three-dimensional model that can be viewed, rotated, refined, and exported in the industry-leading format GLB, which includes full color surpassing previous standards STL, and OBJ, making the output suitable for commercial and consumer 3D printing workflows. The Company emphasized that this capability is natively embedded within RI’s unified multi-modal platform, which already supports video, image, music, voice, research, and code generation. Unlike fragmented or experimental tools, RI’s 2D-to-3D functionality is designed for practical, real-world production use. Based on publicly available information, ReelTime noted that other widely known AI platforms do not currently offer a broadly accessible, single-image 2D-to-3D workflow designed for export and 3D printing, including: The Company further noted that Microsoft (MSFT) has introduced a limited image-to-3D feature through Copilot 3D, which is currently available only via Copilot Labs, requires specific account access, and, according to publicly available descriptions, is not broadly deployed as a fully integrated, print-focused solution. By comparison, ReelTime stated that RI’s solution is available standard within its production platform, does not require specialized labs programs or restricted access, and is designed to generate export-ready 3D models from a single image, a capability the Company believes places RI ahead of larger, centralized, hardware-dependent AI systems. “This milestone reinforces what we have said from the beginning, Reel Intelligence was built differently,” said Barry Henthorn, CEO of ReelTime Media. “RI is a unified, multi-modal intelligence platform, not a collection of disconnected tools. Delivering usable 3D models from a single image is now a real-world capability, and it highlights how RI continues to move ahead of legacy AI architectures.” ReelTime believes this advancement has potential applications across product design, manufacturing, rapid prototyping, media and entertainment, e-commerce visualization, education, and consumer creativity. The Company also emphasized that RI’s distributed, chip-agnostic architecture allows new capabilities to be introduced without reliance on centralized data centers, proprietary chipsets, or capital-intensive infrastructure, an approach that management believes supports long-term scalability and efficiency. As global demand for AI accelerates, Reel Intelligence is positioned for disproportionate long-term opportunity relative to capital-intensive AI incumbents. RI’s distributed, self-learning, multilingual, capital-light architecture aligns with global trends toward efficiency, decentralization, sustainability, and universal accessibility.

Title: NVIDIA Has Rumoredly Cut Down GPU Supply To AICs By 15-20%; Also, No New GPUs This Year

Full Content:
90% Highly Likely Source 4/5 Corroboration 4/5 Technical 5/5 Timeline 5/5 Not just specific GPU models, but it appears that the entire RTX 50 series product lineup is seeing a noticeably reduced supply. [Update - 1/16/26] - NVIDIA has given us an official statement on the current rumors surrounding its RTX 50 series, stating that while demand of RTX GPUs remains strong and memory support is constrained, they continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with their suppliers on memory availability. The full statement is as follows: Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability. NVIDIA to Wccftech If the reports of discontinuation of RTX 5070 Ti and other GPUs weren't bad enough, then you need to see this. Prominent hardware leaker @Zed__Wang has reported that NVIDIA has reduced its GPU supply to its board partners by around 15-20%. This is a significant reduction in the inventory, which will clearly impact the prices and availability in the coming days. The GPU prices have been steadily increasing for a few weeks now, but prepare for the worst. NVDA GPU supply to AIC has been cut down 15%-20%. The good news is that Nvidia still bundles a GPU with memory. The bad news is that there will be no new product in 2026. The leaker says that while the supply will be reduced, NVIDIA will still bundle the GPU with VRAM chips. Perhaps NVIDIA has decided not to discontinue supplying VRAM chips with the GPUs, as was reported previously. Anyways, it wouldn't have made sense to stop bundling VRAM chips when the GPU supply has already been reduced to such an extent. Since NVIDIA has reportedly ended the supply of GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU, and also a bunch of other GPUs due to DRAM shortages, it no longer has to worry a lot about not having enough VRAM chips. The bad news is that it might postpone the RTX 50 "SUPER" series, if not totally cancel it. Since Super series GPUs were expected to utilize 3 GB GDDR7 modules, it will be even harder for NVIDIA to source enough VRAM chips from the memory makers. The leaker's report is suggesting the same, and as per his information, we may not see any new GPUs this year. So, on top of reduced GPU supply, gamers won't have any refreshed series to be able to build or upgrade their PC builds. Similar problems exist with the Red Team as well. Radeon RX 9070 XT continues to see a surge in prices, and the RDNA 4 lineup doesn't have a lot of GPUs to start with. As for its RDNA 5/UDNA lineup, we aren't likely to see it before 2027.

Stock futures are pointing to a higher open Thursday amid a chip stock rally, while investors also digest a new slate of earnings from major banks; Oil futures are sliding as tensions around Iran's recent protests look to be easing; TSMC shares are surging after the chipmaking giant reported strong quarterly results; Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs results handily topped Wall Street expectations; and Nvidia is getting closer to selling H200 chips to China with White House approval. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher as chip stocks lead an early-morning rally following a strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 0.9% recently, while S&P 500 futures added 0.4% and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures hovered near unchanged. The major indexes finished lower for a second straight day on Wednesday as bank stocks retreated following earnings from several major financial institutions. Crude oil futures have dropped below $60 per barrel as tensions with Iran that boosted the commodity in recent days look to have eased. Gold futures were down 0.3% at $4,620 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Wednesday. Bitcoin, which hit its highest level in two months yesterday, was down slightly from those levels, trading at $96,800. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked up to 4.15%. Crude oil futures are tumbling Thursday morning after President Trump said that Iranian officials have told him the killing of protestors has stopped. Recent protests against the government in Iran have resulted in an estimated 2,500 or more deaths, creating uncertainty around the country's stability and therefore the stability of its oil industry. Trump had said previously that the U.S. military could get involved if the protests continued to be met with a violent response from the Iranian government. Crude oil futures surged to a three-month high on Wednesday, but WTI futures, the U.S. benchmark, were down 4% at $59.55 per barrel this morning. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) are surging after the dominant chipmaker topped estimates in its latest quarterly report. For the fourth quarter, TSMC said it generated 1.05 trillion New Taiwan Dollars ($33.73 billion) in revenue, up 25% year-over-year, while profits surged 35% to $3.15 per American Depositary Receipt. Each metric came in higher than the analyst consensus, per estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The contract manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, making advanced chips for many of the industry's heavyweights including Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). TSMC's U.S.-listed shares, which closed at a record high on Monday, were up 6% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia and AMD added 1% and 2%, respectively. Shares of ASML (ASML), which makes equipment used by TSMC and other chipmakers to manufacture the semiconductors, were up more than 7% ahead of the opening bell. The heavy flow of earnings reports from major financial institutions continued this morning, with Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) all releasing fourth-quarterly results. BlackRock reported first, with revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and total assets under management each coming in higher than analysts had forecast. Results from Goldman and Morgan Stanley also handily topped Wall Street expectations. Bank stocks have had a rough week. They sank Monday on a proposal from President Trump to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, and remained under pressure after a string of mixed reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). BlackRock shares were up about 2% in recent premarket trading, while Morgan Stanley fell slightly and Goldman dropped 2%. Nvidia moved a step closer to being able to sell its H200 chips to customers in China again this week, as the Department of Commerce updated its rules for semiconductor exports and Trump said his administration would support the sales. Last month, Trump said Nvidia would be allowed to sell the H200 chips, less advanced than Nvidia's Blackwell and new Vera Rubin chips, to China with the U.S. government receiving a 25% cut of the revenue. The Commerce Department said it would shift from rejecting exports of the chips to a case-by-case review. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that demand has been strong from Chinese customers, but the Chinese government has previously told companies in the country not to buy less advanced Nvidia chips over concerns of the U.S. government's involvement in the process. Nvidia shares were up about 1% recently.

Investing Small-cap stocks have been out of favor for years and might offer the best risk-reward after a huge three-year run for the major indices. With the Russell 2000 up almost 6% in 2026 in just two weeks, many across Wall Street see more gains for the index. With the prospect of an improving U.S. economy in 2026, that should provide a strong tailwind for small-cap and small-cap value stocks. Sending You to Google News in 3 © scyther5 / Getty Images In 2026, the seemingly forgotten Russell 2000 has emerged as the leading equity index, already up 5.6% compared with the S&P 500’s 1.2% gain. That’s because it is uniquely leveraged to a domestic-driven economic rebound, easing financial conditions, and renewed risk appetite for small-cap stocks. Valuation saturation and global exposure trap the large-cap benchmarks. Meanwhile, small-cap companies benefit disproportionately from falling interest rates, improved access to credit, and rising mergers-and-acquisitions activity. These all lower their cost of capital and unlock growth. The index is also more sensitive to U.S. fiscal policy, infrastructure spending, and reshoring trends, allowing earnings growth to accelerate faster than that of multinational mega-caps facing currency and geopolitical headwinds. After years of underperformance, relative valuations in the Russell 2000 entered 2026 at historically attractive levels, setting the stage for multiple expansion as investors rotate toward cyclical growth and away from overcrowded large-cap trades. We have to admit that the surge of the Russell 2000 in 2026 came as somewhat of a surprise to us here at 24/7 Wall St. Yet, the reality is that after three years of double-digit gains for the S&P 500, many of the top stocks, including most of the Magnificent 7, are starting to underperform the index. In fact, only two of the Magnificent 7 outperformed the S&P 500 in 2025: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA).

Title: Just One Major AI GPU Lineup To Consume As Much Memory This Year As 100-150 Million Smartphones, Contributing To $100-$150 Per Unit Price Hikes From Apple And Samsung

Time Published: 2026-01-14T14:13:30Z

NVIDIA's architectural design changes with its new Vera Rubin GPUs will consume a significant proportion of global memory resources this year, when such resources are already in short supply, worsening the memory crunch for all smartphone OEMs, including giants such as Apple and Samsung. These firms would likely have to raise the prices of their 2026-launching smartphones to compensate for the ongoing price-led demand destruction in the memory sphere, as per a new note from KeyBanc. NVIDIA has implemented a number of AI-critical design changes in its new Vera Rubin AI GPUs, which serve to further restrict the already-constrained global memory market and create far-reaching turbulence even for some of the globe's industrial titans such as Apple and Samsung. AI query processing creates a huge temporary memory log for context building purposes, aptly called the KV Cache. For NVIDIA's AI systems, this memory log is currently stored within the high bandwidth memory (HBM) modules. However, with its Vera Rubin AI GPUs, NVIDIA is implementing a new solution, called the Inference Memory Context Storage (ICMS), which will act as a dedicated memory resource for the KV Cache. As we noted in a dedicated post recently, this solution means NVIDIA could pack around 16 TB of NAND per GPU in a rack, which equates to 1,152 TB in a single NVL72 configuration. Now, KeyBanc has added additional color to this critical context by noting that NVIDIA's new AI GPUs could consume as much memory this year as between 100 million to 150 million smartphones, equating to around 10 percent of the global smartphone market: "NVIDIA’s (NVDA) latest Vera CPU utilizes 1.5TB of memory—up from Grace’s 512GB—implying that NVIDIA will require 20 billion gigabits (Gb) of memory this year. This consumption is equivalent to 100–150 million smartphones, or just under 10% of the total smartphone market." These dynamics are worsening the overall situation even for tech titans such as Apple and Samsung. For instance, we reported recently that while Apple has secured access to sufficient NAND resources through the first quarter of 2026, KIOXIA was expected to raise its pricing for Apple once a long-term NAND supply agreement is signed, as per an assessment by Morgan Stanley. Of course, DRAM constitutes an even bigger bottleneck for Apple, especially as Apple had previously secured access to DRAM under very favorable long-term contracts. As such, Morgan Stanley now expects Apple to secure access to DRAM resources through Q1 2026 only with a sequential price hike of over 50 percent. To make matters worse, Apple is experiencing upheaval within other sections of its sprawling supply chain. According to a new Nikkei Asia report, the Cupertino giant is reportedly struggling to secure sufficient supplies of high-end glass fiber cloth (T-glass). For the benefit of those who might not be aware, a substrate serves as the base on which Integrated Circuits (ICs) and other components are placed, while also playing a critical role in heat dissipation.A T-glass, on the other hand, is a special fiberglass with a high silica content that is often used within the substrate for microchips, providing a myriad of benefits, including better thermal stability, a flatter surface for intricate wiring, and higher reliability. Apple purchases almost all of its T-glass from Japan's Nitto Boseki (Nittobo). However, AI-related demand has reportedly exhausted Nittobo's existing supply capacity, forcing Apple to directly approach the Japanese government for assistance in securing enough T-glass supply. The Cupertino giant is also trying to secure its T-glass from alternative sources, including Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, which also relies on Nittobo's T-glass. In the interim, Apple is reportedly mulling using a lower-quality T-glass, but such a move would require extensive prior testing. Samsung's DS division has recently raised the price of DRAM supplied to Samsung's MX division by about 60–70%.They’re pushing such an absurd condition even on MX, which is part of the same family— so just imagine how much they’re raising prices for other companies.I think the… Interestingly, even Samsung, which produces its own memory, is not immune to the ongoing demand-destruction-via-price-hikes dynamics in the memory sphere. As per anecdotal reports, Samsung's DS division, which produces memory chips, has agreed to provide those chips to Samsung's MX mobile division only at price hikes of around 60 percent to 70 percent. The situation has prompted Samsung to raise the price of its upcoming Galaxy S26 series by between $30 and $60 in select regions, including its home market of South Korea. On the whole, given the fact that memory accounts for around 20 percent of a given smartphone's Bill of Materials (BOM), KeyBanc analysts believe that OEMs like Samsung and Apple "may need to raise handset prices by $100–$150, which could negatively weigh on demand."

Title: Strategy Drops $1.25 Billion On Bitcoin Above $91,000

Bitcoin treasury company Strategy has continued its accumulation of the cryptocurrency, taking its holdings to 687,410 BTC with the latest purchase. As announced in an X post by Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor, the company has completed a new Bitcoin acquisition involving 13,627 BTC, spending an average of $91,519 per token or a total of about $1.25 billion. This purchase is rather large; in fact, it’s the biggest buy that the firm has made since July of last year. In his usual Sunday foreshadowing post, Saylor hinted that the acquisition would be significant, using the caption: “₿ig Orange.” In a reply to the post, the Strategy chairman reflected on the company’s accumulation journey, saying, “Ironic that our $60.25 billion Bitcoin position started with a $0.25 billion purchase in August 2020.” Following the purchase announcement, Strategy’s stack has officially grown to 687,410 BTC and total investment to $51.80 billion. At present, these holdings are valued at $63.28 billion, meaning that the treasury company is in a profit of more than 22%. According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the new acquisition took place in the week between January 5th and 11th, funded using proceeds from the company’s MSTR and STRC at-the-market (ATM) stock offerings. Last Monday, Strategy announced expansions for both its Bitcoin treasury and US Dollar reserve, but the focus this week appears to have been on the cryptocurrency alone. The USD reserve, which was created by the company at the start of December, has seen two additions so far, and the latest one took its value to $2.25 billion. In another X post, Saylor has also shared a chart that compares annualized returns for the best-performing assets in the “Bitcoin Standard Era,” referring to the period since August 2020 when the firm made its first purchase of the cryptocurrency. As displayed in the graph, MSTR has produced the second-most annualized returns in this timespan, with its profits of 60% surpassing even BTC’s, which has managed a return of 45%. The number one performing asset in the period has been Nvidia (NVDA), posting annual returns of 68%. The strength behind the company’s stock was initially driven by the Ethereum mining boom and more recently, by the rise of AI datacenters. “The best-performing assets of this decade are Digital Intelligence $NVDA, Digital Credit $MSTR, and Digital Capital $BTC,” Saylor wrote, framing each asset under a distinct role. Bitcoin kicked off 2026 with a recovery surge, but bullish momentum has faded for the asset as its price is still trading around $91,400. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Bitcoin is one of the ‘best-performing assets of this decade’ – Saylor

If late 2025 tested Saylor’s conviction, early 2026 is beginning to confirm it. Strategy’s Michael Saylor has once again drawn attention to the impact of his company’s Bitcoin [BTC]-centric strategy, arguing that it has fundamentally reshaped its market performance. In a post shared on X, Saylor highlighted how the firm has outpaced most Wall Street heavyweights since pivoting to Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset on 10th August 2020. For those unaware, he usually refers to this period as the “Bitcoin Standard Era.” Backing his claim with comparative data, Saylor shared a chart tracking annualized returns across major assets during this timeframe. While Nvidia leads the pack with a staggering 1,557% surge and a 68% compound annual growth rate, Strategy ranks second overall. The company has posted gains of 1,173%, translating into annualized returns of 60%, placing it ahead of nearly all traditional equities and asset classes. Notably, even Bitcoin has delivered comparatively lower returns over the same period. Since August 2020, Bitcoin has risen 674%, equating to an annualized gain of roughly 45%. Taking to X, Saylor noted, “The best-performing assets of this decade are Digital Intelligence $NVDA, Digital Credit $MSTR, and Digital Capital $BTC.” Source: Michael Saylor/X Needless to say, this shift wasn’t driven by hype but by infrastructure. In 2025, digital assets moved beyond retail speculation and became a core part of global financial infrastructure. The rise of the “Bitcoin Treasury” model drove this shift. Following the approach popularized by Michael Saylor, more than 170 public companies adopted Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. By late 2025, NVIDIA further strengthened its dominance with the launch of its Blackwell and Rubin platforms. As a result, what once seemed like an extreme bet is now widely viewed as a survival strategy. Echoing Saylor’s sentiment, one X user added, Source: X However, not everyone was on the same page, as all-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff noted, “Yes, but all that changed toward the end of the decade when $MSTR tanked and $BTC fell. For the next decade the worst-performing assets will likely be Digital Credit MSTR and Digital Capital BTC.” This coincided with NVIDIA Corp. trading at $184.86, following a dip of 0.097%, yet maintaining a robust annual growth of 38.75%. In contrast, MSTR faced a sharper decline, trading at $157.33 after a 9.64% daily drop and a staggering 171.07% decrease over the past year. Meanwhile, BTC slipped to $90,467.38, marking a minor 0.14% dip and a broader 4% weekly decline according to CoinMarketCap. This shows that if the final quarter of 2025 served as a violent stress test for Michael Saylor’s conviction, the opening days of 2026 are proving to be his vindication.

Title: Why Michael Burry's AI skepticism can be explained by an escalator that Warren Buffett built

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/12/2026 7:27:30 AM PST by lasereye Nvidia and Palantir's competitive AI edges won't last, argues Michael Burry Famed for predicting the housing market crash and a vocal skeptic of the AI boom, Michael Burry is now invoking one of the world's most famous investors to add gravitas to his argument. Burry used an escalator built by Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) Chairman Warren Buffett, in a department store he owned in the late 1960s, to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain. "When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

He says to ignore Burry. Navellier is an extremely successful stock market veteran. But - Burry's argument makes sense to me. Somebody else (I can't remember who) recently suggested that LLM's are not all that useful. Another newsletter I subscribe to is Luke Lango's. He is an extremely sharp young guy. He says Nvidia will decline as companies create their own specialized AI chips. 1 posted on 01/12/2026 7:27:30 AM PST by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] Michael Burry, the investor known for his successful bets against the U.S. housing market in 2008 and featured in the film The Big Short, has deregistered his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as of November 10, 2025. The deregistration, which marks the fund’s status as “terminated,” means Scion is no longer required to file public regulatory reports, signaling the end of its operations as a registered investment advisory firm. Burry announced the move on social media platform X, stating, “On to much better things Nov 25th,” hinting at a new venture. He cited a growing misalignment between his valuation estimates and current market prices, expressing concerns about speculative bubbles in AI-related stocks, particularly those of Nvidia and Palantir Technologies.

I very often have to lead it to consider something it had ignored, which can even change the entire original answer it gave, to the exact opposite. It can’t be trusted, but you can review its sources and follow it up to then get a more refined, more likely correct, answer. When AI can streamline something, it will reduce costs and time for that function. It does help a bit with my health work, as before I had to search and read everything. Now, it pulls out enough credible information, although brief, that I can better pick the original sources to plow into, rather than read or skim “everything.” 6 posted on 01/12/2026 7:39:19 AM PST by ConservativeMind (Trump: Befuddling Democrats, Republicans, and the Media for the benefit of the US and all mankind.)

This guy doesn’t know how to make an analogy or coherent argument. When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them. And the escalator companies made a lot of money. 9 posted on 01/12/2026 7:54:56 AM PST by ifinnegan (Democrats kill babies and harvest their organs to sell) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: lasereye Large Language Models can only be as good as the people who speak the language.

Federal appellate-level judges (justices on SCOTUS) should not be in the business of determining or setting policy, much less legislating from the bench. The aforementioned “nixing” of computer-implemented business method patents reeked of judge-made policy. Is AI resurrecting patentability for computer-implemented business methods? This would be ironic, since AI, at it’s most impactful, is said to be a replacement fir human reasoning and creativity, the latter being the sine qua non in terms of the legal basis for issuing patents (no patent can issue for an “invention” created not by a human, but by a computer). 11 posted on 01/12/2026 8:01:50 AM PST by one guy in new jersey [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: lasereye Burry used an escalator . . . to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain.

I have not ready much that Burry has said or written, but this is a classic example that has been debunked over and over. Its stupid to use it. OK. Don't install the escalator and watch your business go bankrupt. While you're at it, don't install electricity or central heat. Other stores have them too and there is no durable margin improvement for them either. Why even have a store? Just sell your goods on the side of the street. 12 posted on 01/12/2026 8:11:06 AM PST by Opinionated Blowhard (When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.)

Burry used an escalator built by Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) Chairman Warren Buffett, in a department store he owned in the late 1960s, to illustrate how vast AI spending may not leading to value accruing across its supply chain. "When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out," Burry said in a discussion with Jack Clark, Anthropic co-founder, and leading podcaster Dwarkesh Patel that published on Substack. That is why "trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning," Burry, who was famously portrayed in "The Big Short" for spotting the subprime bubble, told moderator and newsletter writer Patrick McKenzie. Berkshire Hathaway purchased Baltimore's Hochschild-Kohn department store in 1966 - it was sold three years later - through a company called Diversified Retailing that later merged with the conglomerate. Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

Buffett described in a 1989 letter to shareholders how he learned that a bad business model couldn't be fixed by a cheap price. Like the two department stores, most companies involved in the AI supply chain will see the same benefits if ,any, and none will have a competitive advantage, Burry said. As for Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) - he has big bearish bets against those companies on the view they are overvalued - he says their current advantage with selling products designed for AI won't last. When it comes to Nvidia, for example, he sees small language models (SLMs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) - customized chips used for one purpose - as the future, with neither will need the company's pricey, powerful chips. "Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach," he said. Burry was also fairly busy on X over the weekend, retweeting a post by Tae Kim, the author of The Nvidia Way and a senior technology writer at Barron's, who laid out a case in November on how falling computing costs will help features of AI become more profitable for companies. "In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said. For now though, he expects Nvidia's chips will last up to six years and the need for those waning, or they last just two to three, with hyperscalers' earnings collapsing and "private credit getting destroyed." He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year. Nvidia stock rose 38% over the last 52 weeks as Palantir registered a triple-digit gain.

When every store had to and did put in escalators it didn’t give anyone a competitive edge, but a store that didn’t would have lost business to stores with them.

"In the escalator example, the only value accrued to the customer. This is how it always goes if no monopoly rents can be charged by the producers or providers," added Burry. What would change his mind about AI valuations? "The biggest surprise that would cause me to recalibrate would be autonomous AI agents displacing millions of jobs at the biggest companies," said the author of the hugely popular Substack publication, Cassandra Unchained. "Another would be application-layer revenue hitting $500 billion or more because of a proliferation of killer apps," he said.

He also said that generative AI and LLMs are so expensive it's hard to understand the profit model. Shares of Nvidia and Palantir are basically flat to start the year.

January 12, 2026 10:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference -- NVIDIA and Eli Lilly and Company today announced a first-of-its-kind AI co-innovation lab focused on applying AI to tackle some of the most enduring challenges in the pharmaceutical industry. The lab brings together Lilly’s world-leading expertise in discovering, developing and manufacturing medicines with NVIDIA’s leadership in AI, accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. The two companies will invest up to $1 billion in talent, infrastructure and compute over five years to support the new AI co-innovation lab. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, the lab will co-locate Lilly domain experts in biology, science and medicine with top AI model builders and engineers from NVIDIA, allowing them to work side by side to generate large-scale data and build powerful AI models that can accelerate medicine development, using NVIDIA BioNeMo™ as the critical platform. “AI is transforming every industry, and its most profound impact will be in life sciences,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA and Lilly are bringing together the best of our industries to invent a new blueprint for drug discovery — one where scientists can explore vast biological and chemical spaces in silico before a single molecule is made.” “For nearly 150 years, we’ve been working to bring life-changing medicines to patients,” said David A. Ricks, chair and CEO of Lilly. “Combining our volumes of data and scientific knowledge with NVIDIA’s computational power and model-building expertise could reinvent drug discovery as we know it. By bringing together world-class talent in a startup environment, we’re creating the conditions for breakthroughs that neither company could achieve alone.” Building a Continuous Learning System for Drug DiscoveryThe collaboration will initially focus on creating a continuous learning system that tightly connects Lilly’s agentic wet labs with computational dry labs, enabling 24/7 AI-assisted experimentation to support biologists and chemists. This scientist-in-the-loop framework aims to enable experiments, data generation and AI model development to continuously inform and improve one another. Harnessing access to unprecedented compute for the industry, massive, high-quality data generation and NVIDIA BioNeMo as the platform to accelerate drug discovery, the teams will focus on building next-generation foundation and frontier models for biology and chemistry. The new initiative expands on Lilly’s previously announced AI supercomputer and intends to harness investments in next-generation NVIDIA architectures, including NVIDIA Vera Rubin. The AI factory Lilly announced last fall, which is the most powerful in the pharmaceutical industry, will train large biomedical foundation and frontier models for identifying, optimizing and validating new molecules with exceptional speed and accuracy. It will also support new and advanced applications in manufacturing, medical imaging and scientific AI agents. Beyond drug discovery, NVIDIA and Lilly will explore opportunities to apply AI across clinical development, manufacturing and commercial operations to integrate multimodal models, agentic AI, robotics and digital twins. The use of physical AI and robotics in the AI factory will also help Lilly enhance its capacity to manufacture high-demand medications and strengthen supply chain reliability. With NVIDIA Omniverse™ libraries and NVIDIA RTX PRO™ Servers, Lilly can create digital twins of its manufacturing lines to model, stress test and optimize entire supply chains before making physical changes in the real world. Supporting Global Leadership in Biomedical DiscoveryNVIDIA leads in open-source AI, empowering companies with the models, data and tools needed to develop real-world AI systems. In addition, the NVIDIA Inception program provides startups with access to technical mentorship, as well as NVIDIA software and compute. Lilly TuneLab, an AI and machine learning platform, provides biotech companies with access to select Lilly models for drug discovery built on decades of Lilly’s proprietary data. TuneLab will include NVIDIA Clara™ open foundation models for life sciences as part of a future workflow offering. The co-innovation lab will provide NVIDIA and Lilly’s startup ecosystems and researchers with deep expertise and scale of computing resources.
