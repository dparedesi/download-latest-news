ByNicolas Straut ByNicolas Straut, Contributor. When constructing your investment of $1,000 you should consider what the core of your portfolio will ... More be made up of and your investment aims. You could spend your $1,000 on anything, but you made the wise decision to invest it in equities to grow your wealth. This guide will share some of the best stocks for 2025 including growth, income and volatile but high-returning opportunities. These recommendations are based on analyst ratings, sector exposure, earnings and recent momentum. As you consider this mix of equity options including the "magnificent seven” stocks, large value-oriented companies, REITs and technology stocks, you’ll see some familiar names as well as learn new ones, each with interesting theses as to why you should consider them for your portfolio. Ultimately, constructing a portfolio is research intensive and while you may not invest in each of these picks, you’ll hopefully be exposed to new industries and gain insight into the vast array of stock opportunities at your disposal. Microsoft is a tech giant and household name known for a variety of products from software with Office and Windows, to cloud computing services with Azure, to gaming with Xbox. Its latest venture in AI, through Copilot in partnership with OpenAI, is bringing AI functionality to a broader audience in hopes of better competing with Google and Apple, both of whom are expanding AI features to their customer bases. This behemoth tech stock is a pick because of both its strong balance sheet and consistent earnings, as well as its reliable dividend. Microsoft is also worthwhile to consider for your stock portfolio because of its aforementioned offering of Azure, the customer base of which is growing 14.2% year-over-year, with over 350,000 organizations utilizing it. This strong showing makes Microsoft more competitive with Amazon’s AWS, a dominant cloud services provider. Microsoft is an ideal fit for investors seeking a long-term hold stock delivering innovation-fueled growth, a strong leadership team, and security in a world adapting to AI. You’ve likely heard of NVIDIA in the context of its dominance in the world of chips, with the company holding over 80% market share for sale of data center GPUs. In particular, NVIDIA’s H100 and its now in full production Blackwell chips which power AI training and compute for the top technology firms like Google, Amazon and Microsoft. NVIDIA’s growth isn’t slowing down with revenue in Q1 up 69% from a year ago. While this firm does have a high P/E, NVIDIA backs it up with strong revenue and income rising as more firms invest in AI to capture its promise. The majority of analysts also maintain this stock as a buy or strong buy. NVIDIA is a good fit for those who want a high-growth stock with more room to grow, who don’t prioritize a dividend yield and who are bullish on the continued adoption of AI. Long associated with its founder, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway is a large firm delivering broad exposure to industries like insurance through Geico, car manufacturers like Mitsubishi, and technology like Apple. While Buffett may have recently stepped down, Berkshire is in solid leadership hands with years of experience working under Buffett’s tutelage and with his famous methodology and wisdom, passed down by both memos and direct work experience. Berkshire holds over $340 billion in cash, awaiting a market downturn or the right opportunities, giving them a secure buffer and investment capital for their next big stakes. While Berkshire offers no dividend, this stock offers high returns with over 20% returned over the last year. This stock offers diversification and a conservative value-driven investing approach to your portfolio. Visa is a credit card-processing giant which processes north of 40 billion transactions annually, earning fees from each purchase. With a moat built around its network which is global, billions of cards in use, deep integration with financial institutions and over 1 billion more cards in circulation than its primary competitor, Mastercard, Visa is well positioned to provide financial sector exposure and security to investors. Visa continues to expand, with new partnerships penetrating into emerging markets, and growth from digital payments through providers like Apple Pay. A majority of analysts consider Visa a buy or strong buy based on its financials and growth prospects. Investors who want a dominant financial sector stock which is conservative and global would be well suited to buy this stock. Palantir is a technology company which offers software systems primarily to the U.S. government but also to corporate clients with a suite of platforms delivering data integration, intelligence and analysis. Two of its primary platforms are Foundry, which is used for data centralization and analysis by healthcare companies, commercial firms and governments, as well as Gotham, which is an intelligence and data platform used for defense. With year-over-year revenue growth of 39% and a recent contract with the U.S. government of more than $100 million, Palantir is well positioned for growth from both its commercial and government platforms. Palantir is a mixed bag in analysts’ eyes with many considering it a stock to hold rather than buy. But with a moat of hard-to-acquire contracts from major firms and government actors and increasingly-advanced products fueled by AI, Palantir could be a worthwhile growth play in your portfolio. Ideal investors for this stock would be those comfortable with volatility in exchange for long-term growth who are not seeking a dividend. Realty Income is a top REIT that owns thousands of commercial properties which lease space to firms like Walgreens, FedEx and other well-known consumer-facing companies. Investors choose O for reliable, monthly dividends which have been paying out income for decades even in the midst of economic downturns. Realty Income offers around 5.6% in dividends making it a desirable option for investors seeking reliable income, like retirees, those supplementing their own income or investors seeking to round out a growth-heavy portfolio. Realty Income’s diverse clients provide some resiliency even in down markets, and this stock has performed well even as growth stocks dip in price. O could be a good addition to your portfolio if you’re seeking to balance out other equities, if you’re seeking income or would simply like real estate exposure without buying land or properties yourself. Carvana is a technology-driven firm which makes it easy for consumers to buy or finance cars online. While its business suffered and nearly went bankrupt in 2022, it grew considerably over the last two years, nearly reaching its 2021 peak of just over $360 a share. This return to life was due to its innovative car purchasing model and drastically reduced costs. Carvana is a volatile, growth-driven stock that should be considered by investors seeking short-term gains as it rises in value. Over the last year it experienced a return of over 172% without sign of slowing down. As with Strategy, which will be discussed next, consider your risk tolerance and what percentage of your portfolio you would feel comfortable risking for juiced portfolio returns. Bitcoin treasury companies are a big trend in 2025 as they bet on bitcoin’s continued growth and adoption. The principal driver of this trend is Strategy Incorporated (previously Microstrategy). Strategy holds almost 600,000 Bitcoin, each valued as of July 1, 2025 at $105,820, and continues to buy the cryptocurrency by issuing debt or equity. This stock has risen over 170% in the last year fueled by easing of regulation on crypto, clearance of bitcoin ETFs and speculation that bitcoin will continue to rise in price. Microstrategy is thought of by some as a leveraged BTC play as MSTR often grows by 2x to 3x the growth of bitcoin, but this leverage can work in the opposite direction if bitcoin crashes. MSTR is a worthwhile investment for investors who don’t mind the high risk that the stock or BTC carries, in the hopes of continued high growth. If you do consider using part of your $1,000 to purchase MSTR, understand the risk that both this stock and bitcoin carries and invest according to your risk tolerance. Bottom Line When constructing your investment of $1,000 you should consider your risk tolerance, but also what the core of your portfolio will be made up of and your investment aims. From this list, a good core stock makeup for stability, quality and reasonable growth would be Microsoft, NVIDIA, Visa and Berkshire Hathaway. Good growth stocks to add in moderation and according to risk tolerance, are Palantir and Carvana. For additional yield, Realty Income could be added to deliver monthly dividends and stability in downturns, and finally, Strategy could be added to deliver crypto exposure as well as the potential for high returns. This stock mix with your $1,000 would deliver income, growth and portfolio stability. Ultimately there are thousands of stocks available to consider for your portfolio but with research, analysis and consideration of your financial position, you can grow your net worth and achieve the future you seek.

Title: One Big Beautiful Bill & Job Growth Send Stocks To New Highs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/07/05/one-big-beautiful-bill--job-growth-send-stocks-to-new-highs/

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Continued job growth and an expected economic boost from the tax cuts in the One Beautiful Big Bill ... More Act (OBBBA) helped push the probability of an economic downturn closer to the lows of the year. President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline looms as the next big hurdle this week. Better-than-expected job growth and the passage of US tax legislation propelled the S&P 500 to all-time highs on Friday. Please note that the tax bill is named the One Beautiful Big Bill Act (OBBBA), so no partisan political views are intended by using its name. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The resiliency of the labor market and an expected economic boost from the tax cuts in the OBBBA helped push the probability of an economic downturn closer to the lows of the year. Stocks & Recession Odds The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since the stocks bottomed, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. This data bolsters confidence in the view that the macroeconomic situation has been the primary driver of stocks so far this year. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks The S&P 500 reached an all-time high in the holiday-shortened week, now resting at 2.2% above its previous mid-February high after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 3.5% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. The strength in US bank stocks remains notable. The Federal Reserve recently revised its methodology, which will result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital means better profitability and the ability to return more capital to shareholders. In addition, banks are economically sensitive, so they typically receive a boost from better economic outlooks. Market Returns Employment grew by 147,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. Previous data was revised slightly higher, which is a positive. The household survey data was solid, with a gain of 93,000 jobs, and the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 751,000. The significant increase in the research series reverses much of the decline from the previous month. Monthly Job Growth Contrary to expectations, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%. The decline was due to job gains of 93,000 in the household survey and a reduction of 130,000 in the labor force. US Unemployment Rate Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.8% last month. The average workweek hours were lower at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, hampered by weather and the LA fires. Workweek & Wages Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The improvement in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence that the labor market has been resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Bottom line: The details of the jobs report were less impressive than the headline, but job growth was better than expected, and labor market health remains solid. Markets currently expect two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. The better jobs data eliminated any chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is still expected in September. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Economic data releases are sparse this week. In addition, there are only two companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings. Now that the One Beautiful Big Bill Act (OBBBA) has been signed into law, President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline should be the focus. While deals with Vietnam and the UK, as well as a détente with China, have been reached, the tariff levels of many large trading partners remain unsettled, barring a trade agreement. President Trump said letters are being sent to the countries notifying them of the effective tariff rate on their exports to the US, effective August 1, unless a trade deal is reached. Market participants will be keen to see if more trade deals are signed or if the possible economic drag from higher tariffs begins to weigh on the US economic outlook again. Stocks have reacted favorably to the better economic data and the likely boost from the tax cuts passed last week. The hurdles at these valuation levels are higher, but optimism about future corporate earnings has improved as economic downside risks have receded. Another spike in effective tariff rates around President Trump’s July 9 deadline could raise concerns about the economic headwinds increasing again, so increased volatility would not be unexpected.

Title: Are Deals Back? IPOs, M&A Recover After 'Liberation Day' Blip
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/are-deals-back-ipos-m-and-a-recover-after-liberation-day-blip-11764018

For a while, it looked like the boom in deal activity that was expected after President Donald Trump retook the White House wouldn't happen. Companies pulled IPOs as the Liberation Day tariffs hit sentiment, while others put acquisition plans on hold. Deals, in short, dried up. But that seems to be changing. Deal activity is picking up for a host of reasons, experts say, among them Trump's retreat from some of his harsher tariff plans and increasing investor expectations that trade deals will be struck or tariffs at least kept at their baseline levels. Add to that a relatively resilient U.S. economy and record-high stock markets and you get a recipe for rising deal volume. IPO and M&A volumes are at their highest levels in years, according to Dealogic data, after years when high interest rates put a damper on things. In the first half of 2025, 174 companies raised more than $31 billion from U.S. IPOs, the most since 2021, when a record $200 billion of funds were raised in the same year-to-date period. U.S. M&A volume so far this year has already topped $989 billion, the highest level since 2021's record year, when there were $1.56 trillion in deals in the same period. Trump's Liberation Day tariffs hit stock markets and led companies like Swedish fintech Klarna to pause plans for IPOs. That's changing as investors are piling into tech and fintech firms, and investors are eyeing the possibility of interest-rate cuts in the second half that could keep stocks rising. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), has since seen its shares more than triple since its March listing. USDC stable coin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) was among June's IPO stars, benefiting from the increasing popularity of crytocurrencies and bitcoin; Israel-based retail trading platform eToro (ETOR) and space and defense tech firm Voyager Technologies (VOYG) were also among June's star listings. Circle and CoreWeave "in particular have been outstanding performers and a big driver of investor interest," said Dealogic’s Global ECM Head Samuel Kerr said. The pipeline of new deals is now building up again: In early July, design software maker Figma filed for an IPO. Here are 2025’s top five US IPOs ranked by funds raised, according to Dealogic. LNG exporter Venture Global (VG) raised $1.75 billion from its January IPO, the most by a listing so far this year in the U.S. and the most since Lineage's $5.1 billion listing in July last year. Unlike some more recent tech IPOs, its shares have lagged below their listing price. CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), raised $1.57 billion from its listing on the Nasdaq in March. It had a tepid debut, but has since become one of this year's stars, trading more than three times above its $40 IPO price. SailPoint, a Texas-based cybersecurity company that private equity firm Thoma Bravo took private in 2022, made its return to public markets in February, raising $1.38 billion from its listing. Its shares continue to lag its $23 IPO price. Crypto firm Circle Internet Group (CRCL) has been one of this year's IPO stars, raising $1.21 billion from its IPO priced at $31 a share in June; the stablecoin issuer's stock is now around $189. The fifth-biggest IPO this year was the $994 million June offer by fintech firm Chime Financial. Its shares remain above their $27 IPO price. M&A volumes, which like IPOs took a hit this year, have been helped by enthusiasm for companies linked to artificial intelligence. “Although March brought a burst of large-cap deals, optimism faded in April after ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs sent shockwaves through the market," Mergermarket Head Lucinda Guthrie said. "Still, the opportunities presented by the volatility in the public markets drew attention from private capital. A key deal driver in 1H25 has been M&A to fuel the evolving AI landscape. " Here are the top M&A deals so far this year in the U.S, according to Dealogic, ranked by deal size, with No. 1, the funding round into ChatGPT maker OpenAI— illustrating the allure of AI investments. (All the deal volumes are excluding debt.) The ChatGPT maker raised $40 billion in new funding from a group of investors who took a 13.3% stake in a round led by SoftBank Group. Other investors included its biggest backer, Microsoft (MSFT). Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) struck a $32 billion cash deal for cybersecurity startup Wiz in March that would be the tech giant’s largest acquisition ever. The deal hasn't closed yet. In June, Swiss building-materials company Holcim spun off its North American operations in a $28.7 billion deal. The Chicago-based cement and roofing provider started trading under the stock symbol (AMRZ). Charter Communications (CHTR) announced a $24.1 billion deal in May to buy privately held rival Cox Communications in a deal that would combine two of the U.S.'s largest cable providers. The deal has yet to close. Nuclear power producer Constellation Energy (CEG) agreed to buy private energy company Calpine for $17 billion excluding debt, a transaction that would create the largest clean energy provider in the U.S. The combined company would serve the AI boom, feeding the growing power needs of data centers.

Nvidia (NVDA) could be poised to claim the title of most valuable company in history, as its market value nears $4 trillion. The AI chipmaker's shares rose just over 1% to close at an all-time high of $159.34 Thursday, pushing its market capitalization to $3.89 trillion. If the stock had sustained its intraday highs closer to $161, its market value would have topped Apple's (AAPL) closing record of $3.91 trillion in December. With another roughly 3% rise from Thursday's closing price to $163.93, Nvidia could also hit the $4 trillion market cap threshold soon, something no other company has done. Microsoft (MSFT), which has jockeyed with Nvidia this year for the title of world's most valuable company, could too, according to Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives. “We believe both Nvidia and Microsoft will hit the $4 trillion market cap club this summer and then over the next 18 months the focus will be on the $5 trillion club....as this tech bull market is still early being led by the AI Revolution," the analysts said in a note to clients Thursday. Thursday's rise came amid broader market gains, with the benchmark S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq hitting all-time highs ahead of a long holiday weekend. The stock market closed early at 1 p.m. ET Thursday ahead of the July 4 holiday on Friday.

Title: How Lam Research Stock Gets To $200

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The Lam Research Corporation logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, ... More United States, on December 17, 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), a prominent supplier of equipment for chip fabrication, is poised to gain from the increasing capital expenditures driven by the burgeoning generative artificial intelligence industry. While AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) grabs attention with its stock price soaring more than 3 times over the last two years and its valuation approaching $4 trillion, less known companies like Lam play an essential role in the manufacturing of the AI chips that Nvidia markets. These stocks may provide a more stable value with significant potential for upside. The data is persuasive. According to SEMI, capital expenditure on advanced chip-making equipment is expected to nearly double from 2023 to 2028, and global capex spending is anticipated to exceed $100 billion in 2025 alone. Lam, which focuses on deposition and etching equipment—two of the foremost processes in chip production—may be well-positioned to seize a substantial portion of this investment. The company’s primary clients include industry titans like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel, establishing it as a key player in both the logic and memory sectors of the chip market. Although traditionally dominant in memory chips, Lam is broadening its footprint in advanced logic chips and packaging technologies—fields that are witnessing increasing demand as chip design complexity escalates. AI tasks require not just advanced processing power but also high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and intricate stacking architectures. For instance, the fabrication of HBM chips is three times more wafer-intensive than standard DRAM because of lower bit density and the requirement for 3D stacking. This results in a direct increase in demand for tools manufactured by companies like Lam. Whereas chip designers such as Nvidia have experienced skyrocketing valuations, Lam's stock has lagged. Shares have decreased by approximately 9% over the past 12 months and presently trade at around 24 times forward earnings, while Nvidia trades at about 35 times. Indeed, the valuation disparity is partly attributable to Lam’s reliance on China, which represented 31% of revenues in the March quarter. Ongoing U.S. export restrictions have impacted this segment, likely restricting Lam's capacity to capitalize on the substantial Chinese market. According to consensus estimates, Lam's revenues are projected to grow by around 22% in FY25, although growth is expected to cool to roughly 2% in FY’26, in part due to these China-related challenges, with earnings also expected to remain flat. Nonetheless, if heightened demand related to AI, combined with a possible relaxation of chip equipment export restrictions to China, leads to sustained revenue growth at FY’25 rates of about 22% annually over the next three years, Lam's revenue could increase by around 1.8 times. Even if profit margins stay near current levels of 27% (as recorded over the first nine months of FY25), and if the valuation multiple rises to about 30 times (up from 24 times currently, a 1.25 times growth), the stock could potentially double from the current price of approximately $97 to over $200 per share. Several scenarios could lead to this outcome. Last week, the U.S. and China established a trade framework that encompasses rare earth exports and a potential relaxation of technology restrictions. If this easing of tensions applies to chip equipment exports, companies like Lam might gain renewed access to a vital growth market, further enhancing revenues. Furthermore, the process of chip manufacturing is becoming increasingly capital-intensive, meaning that a larger portion of the chip's expense is now equipment-related—a distinct advantage for companies like Lam. Additionally, advanced packaging methods, such as stacking and connecting multiple chips, which are already being used for AI tasks, should boost the demand for Lam’s high-end machinery. Certainly, Lam faces significant risks. Beyond the China issue, the memory chip arena, where Lam has historically excelled, is encountering pricing pressures. Flash memory prices have been declining due to decreased demand from consumer markets and capex in this sector has been subdued as key players reduce production. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, and U.S. tariffs could further obscure Lam’s short-term growth prospects. Although Lam is a highly specialized company with robust intellectual property, it may not enjoy the same protective barrier as a firm like ASML, which essentially has a monopoly over its trade of extreme ultraviolet lithography. On the other hand, Lam faces numerous competitors, such as Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron, which also provide similar services. That said, the long-term upcycle appears to be secure. The global semiconductor market is forecasted to surpass $1 trillion in annual revenue by 2030, rising from approximately $624 billion in 2024 according to the Wall Street Journal. As chip manufacturers adopt next-generation technologies to enable AI, the demand for sophisticated manufacturing tools is likely to remain high, directly benefiting Lam. While investing in a single stock like LRCX entails risk, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), delivering robust returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered an adaptive means to maximize the advantages of favorable market conditions while curbing losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
