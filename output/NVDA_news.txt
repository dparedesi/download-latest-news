US stocks faltered on Thursday, pulling back from a bid for fresh records as AI optimism waned and markets waited for more detail on President Donald Trump's tariff plans. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.2% higher, with a record high not far off. Meanwhile, The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped, as fellow megacap techs Apple (AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) also lost ground. Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. The focus is now on Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos later Thursday for more insight into his trade policy. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Shares in Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) edged lower after business shifts by the tech leaders in Canada, a prime tariff target for Trump. The e-commerce giant will close its warehouses in Quebec, with a loss of about 1,700 jobs, while Tesla plans hefty price hikes on all its EV models sold in Canada. Eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set that tone on Wednesday. GE Aerospace (GE) shares popped after the jet engine maker said it will raise share buybacks to $7 billion. In air carriers, American Airlines (AAL) stock slid after a downbeat 2025 profit forecast, and Alaska Airlines (ALK) shares rose thanks to a smaller-than-expected first quarter loss forecast. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to poor performance of two of its video games: its soccer title, EA Sports FC 2025, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Both of those missed expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on February 4. US stocks were mixed on Thursday, pulling back from near record levels as the markets awaited a speech from President trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped roughly 0.2%, coming off a record intraday high on Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. Meanwhile, The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.5% as tech stocks struggled. Nvidia (NVDA) shares sliped along with Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Investors are still awaiting any new developments on the tariff front. President Trump is expected to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos later Thursday.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks were mixed Thursday as investors stayed attuned to remarks from President Donald Trump, who addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, coming off a three-day win streak that saw the benchmark index close Wednesday on the cusp of setting a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded 0.6% higher, with a record not far off. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell around 0.2% as tech stocks struggled to regain the momentum that propelled the previous day's gains. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped after its supplier SK Hynix (000660.KS) flagged uncertainty about chip demand this year, which also weighed on other related stocks. The focus turned to Trump's remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos for more insight into his trade policy. The president said he will "demand that interest rates drop immediately." He also said he will ask OPEC to bring down the price of oil. On the tariff front, the president offered a warning to companies. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff." Investors are still digesting Trump's early-days policy charge, which brought an AI push that invigorated tech names but left unclear when the outlined tariffs on big trading partners — a risk for inflation and stocks — might hit. Yahoo Finance is on the ground at Davos. See the latest from the world's business leaders here. Meanwhile, eyes are on earnings to potentially buoy markets, after Netflix (NFLX) set the stage for next week's Big Tech flurry. On the data front, US jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 223,000, official figures released on Thursday showed. Economists had expected a reading of 220,000 for the week. President Trump said he will ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia to bring down the price of oil. "I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down," said Trump during his remote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately. Right now the price is high enough that that war will continue, you've got to bring down the oil price. You've got to end that war," he said. Russia, a major producer of oil and gas, is an OPEC ally. The cartel currently has production cuts in place in order to keep a floor on prices. Both West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) fell roughly 1% following Trump's comments. President Trump said he will demand that interest rates drop in the US. "I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us,” Trump said remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved to a session high, up 0.5% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell slightly. President Trump spoke remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing via video to a packed room of CEOs and world officials. The President first listed a series of actions he took upon entering the White House, including withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and declaring a national energy emergency. On the topic of tariffs, the President said: "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth." "But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff — differing amounts, but a tariff. Attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos are waiting for President Trump's special address via video. Investors watching the remote speech will pay attention to any talk about the President's tariff policy. President Trump will also take questions after his remarks. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose after Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a post on X that she will chair the Senate Banking Subcommittee on digital assets. The token moved up to about $105,000 at around 10:50 a.m. ET. Earlier this week, Lummis said she spoke with Eric Trump about the possibility of creating a strategic bitcoin reserve at the inaugural lunch on Monday. Late last year, she introduced a proposal that would give the Federal Reserve the right to own the cryptocurren. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Chip stocks fell across the board early on Thursday after a Nvidia (NVDA) supplier made comments on its earnings call that indicated uncertainty about semiconductor demand this year. South Korea-based SK Hynix (000660.KS) makes memory chips for Nvidia’s GPUs (graphics processing units), which are used in data centers to underpin artificial intelligence software. After SK Hynix reported fourth quarter earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations, its head of finance, Woo-Hyun Kim, painted a careful picture of the year ahead. “2025's memory demand outlook is clouded by inventory adjustments from PC and smartphone OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] as well as strengthened protective trade policies and geopolitical risks,” Kim said on a post-earnings conference call. Following the comments, Nvidia shares sank as much as 2%. British chip designer Arm's (ARM) stock dropped nearly 6%, and SK Hynix rival Micron (MU) shares fell roughly 4%. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports from Davos: Up and down the promenade at the World Economic Forum this week, leaders agree on one thing about artificial intelligence: It's darn powerful, and it's starting to materially impact how business is done and will be done. Think AI on the cusp of rendering human call centers and HR departments obsolete. What leaders can't agree on is whether AI is already out of control — whether it's beyond the point of being successfully regulated or having the proper guardrails. "I'm not sure it's [AI] out of control. I think there are use cases that sometimes people want to showcase [for] ... their own benefits, to see, hey, this is the potential. But the reality is that enterprises are very smart," HPE CEO Antonio Neri told Yahoo Finance at the annual gathering of top business leaders. Read more here. American Airlines (AAL) stock fell nearly 8% after the carrier forecast a surprise loss for its first quarter. The outlook is a departure from the major air travel carriers' bullish performance in recent quarters. American expects an adjusted loss of as much as $0.40 a share for the current quarter. Analysts were expecting a profit of at least $0.01, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The airline posted record fourth quarter revenue of $13.7 billion and record full-year revenue of $54.2 billion. The company's profit for the current quarter is expected to be impacted by a rise in non-fuel expenses as it continues to win back business after changing its corporate sales strategy. American had implemented changes that pushed corporate customers to book directly with the airline, instead of third-party travel managers. Electronic Arts (EA) stock tumbled 15% on Thursday after the game publisher said quarterly bookings fell to roughly $2.22 billion, missing analyst expectations. The decline was due to the poor performance of two of its video games: soccer title "EA Sports FC 2025" and "Dragon Age: The Veilguard." Both of those missed bookings expectations. The company cut its bookings outlook for the 2025 fiscal year to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. EA is expected to release its complete results on Feb. 4.

Title: AI crypto coins take over: Is Trump’s $500B investment behind it all?

The future of crypto is AI—and it’s happening now. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has real-world applications across industries like business, technology, healthcare, and finance. The crypto sector is no exception, with AI-based tokens now commanding a market cap of $48 billion. Trump’s ‘no crypto’ stance may have rattled the broader market, but his $500 billion AI investment sent AI crypto coins soaring, with low-caps jumping 15% in 24 hours. Nvidia (NVDA) has now dethroned Apple (AAPL) as the world’s largest company, with a market cap soaring to $311 trillion – up 4.43% since Trump’s $500 billion AI investment. This is a clear sign that the AI revolution is taking off. AI-based crypto tokens aren’t far behind. In just two years, the market cap of AI-focused crypto coins surged by a massive 2,592%, reaching a staggering $70 billion by November last year. Leading the charge? NEAR Protocol [NEAR], boasting a solid market value of $5.89 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap But that’s just the beginning. Take Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), for instance, jumping into the ‘AI agent’ space, which Microsoft’s CEO just called the future of software development. Clearly, these coins are tapping into the tech to create real-world applications that are catching the eye of both individuals and institutional investors. However, the AI crypto market isn’t immune to volatility. In just two months, its market cap took a 31% dip, as the broader crypto market saw massive profit-taking. Can Trump’s $500 billion AI investment turn things around? Right now, Trump’s actions are shaking up the crypto world. Take the TRUMP memecoin, for example, which has seen billions in market cap vanish after Trump’s ‘no crypto’ stance in his first 42 executive orders. Bitcoin is also feeling the squeeze, with its market share down 7% to $2.02 trillion. And AI crypto coins? They’re not immune, with many slipping into the red. Source: CoinMarketCap But there’s hope on the horizon. Trump’s massive $500 billion investment could spark a major rebound for AI tokens. We’ve seen these coins surge after Nvidia’s quarterly reports in the past, and with AI sentiment at an all-time high in the U.S., the future looks promising. Read NEAR Protocol’s [NEAR] Price Prediction 2025–2026 The road ahead won’t be easy, though. AI crypto coins need to break free from Bitcoin’s volatility and carve out their own space. But with a 2592% growth in less than three years, they’re on the right track. As tech giants gear up for the AI revolution, more capital could flood into the AI crypto coins. 2025 could be their year – definitely one to watch.

Title: Microsoft Eases Control on OpenAI in $500B Venture

Time Published: 2025-01-23T00:00:00Z

In a significant development within the tech industry, Microsoft (MSFT) announced on Tuesday that it has revised key terms of its longstanding partnership with OpenAI. This change comes in the wake of OpenAI's announcement of a joint venture with Oracle (ORCL) and Japan's SoftBank Group aimed at establishing a groundbreaking $500 billion network of AI data centers in the United States. The partnership dubbed the "Stargate" initiative, is designed to bolster the U.S.'s position in the global AI race, particularly against competitors like China. During a press conference at the White House, President Donald Trump unveiled the Stargate project, emphasizing its importance for national competitiveness. The initiative aims to leverage advanced chips from Nvidia (NVDA) to enhance AI capabilities across various sectors. As part of this venture, OpenAI will have an equity stake and operational control, with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son appointed as chairman of the board. Historically, Microsoft has held exclusive rights to provide cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI since 2019. However, the new agreement allows OpenAI to explore additional capacity options, primarily for research and model training. This shift opens the door for OpenAI to collaborate with Oracle and potentially other cloud service providers. Despite these changes, Microsoft reassured stakeholders that its core partnership with OpenAI remains intact. The tech giant retains exclusive rights to offer OpenAI's API—an essential revenue source for the company—ensuring that Oracle will not host this critical service. In a blog post, Microsoft stated that "the key elements of our partnership remain in place for the duration of our contract through 2030," including access to OpenAI's intellectual property and ongoing revenue-sharing arrangements. Microsoft also highlighted a recent commitment from OpenAI to utilize its Azure cloud services extensively, further solidifying their collaborative efforts. This commitment underscores Microsoft's role as a significant investor and partner in advancing OpenAI's technology. As the landscape of AI development evolves, this partnership adjustment signals a strategic pivot for both Microsoft and OpenAI. The Stargate project represents one of the largest investments in AI infrastructure to date, with initial funding of $100 billion set to expand over four years. This ambitious plan aims not only to enhance AI capabilities but also to create jobs and foster innovation within the U.S. The collaboration between Microsoft, Oracle, and other technology partners like Nvidia and Arm will be crucial in building out this infrastructure. As noted by Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison during the announcement, construction is already underway in Texas, with plans for multiple data centers designed to support expansive AI operations. This evolving landscape presents an exciting opportunity for innovation in artificial intelligence. The collaboration between major players like Microsoft and OpenAI illustrates a commitment to advancing technology while navigating competitive pressures. As these companies work together to build robust AI infrastructure, it will be interesting to see how they balance exclusivity agreements with collaborative efforts that benefit the broader tech ecosystem. As we witness these transformative partnerships unfold, it is essential for stakeholders—be they investors, developers, or consumers—to stay informed about how these changes will impact technological advancements and market dynamics in the coming years. The future of AI is not just about competition; it's about collaboration that drives progress and innovation forward. ©2025 C# Corner. All contents are copyright of their authors.

Title: What to know about 'Stargate,' the $500 billion AI infrastructure project touted by Trump

After scrapping the Biden administration’s executive order on artificial intelligence, President Donald Trump announced a half-a-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure plan alongside some of the technology’s top leaders. The president was joined by OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, SoftBank (SFTBY+1.64%) chief executive Masayoshi Son, and Oracle (ORCL-1.07%) chief technology officer Larry Ellison at the White House on Tuesday evening where he announced the Stargate Project, the largest in U.S. history. The new joint venture “intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,” the AI startup said in a statement. Stargate is starting with an initial $100 billion investment and counts OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi-based AI investor MGX as initial equity funders. Here’s what else you need to know about the Stargate Project. The Stargate project is investing in building new data centers and other AI infrastructure in the U.S. The investment “will secure” the U.S.’s AI leadership, provide hundreds of thousands of jobs, “and generate massive economic benefit for the entire world,” according to OpenAI. Stargate will “support the re-industrialization of the United States” and “provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies,” the startup added. SoftBank and OpenAI are co-leading the project, with SoftBank taking financial responsibility and OpenAI overseeing operations. Son will be Stargate’s chairman. Elon Musk, a close Trump ally with his own AI startup, responded to the news on X that he has “on good authority” that the Japanese bank “has well under $10B secured.” Altman responded that Musk was “wrong” and invited the billionaire to visit the first site under construction. Along with OpenAI and Oracle, British chip design firm Arm (which SoftBank has a 90% stake in), Nvidia (NVDA-1.61%), and OpenAI’s longstanding partner, Microsoft (MSFT-0.05%), will be “key technology partners” in the project. OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia will work together on the project’s first buildout in Texas, OpenAI said, adding that the computing system is a result of a years-long collaboration between it and Nvidia, and a new partnership between it and Oracle. Ellison said Tuesday that the project’s first data centers are already under construction. “Each building is a half a million square feet,” Ellison said. “There are 10 buildings currently being built, but that will expand to 20 and other locations beyond the Abilene location, which is our first location.” The project is still evaluating other potential sites and finalizing definitive agreements. OpenAI said the project builds on its relationship with its largest investor and exclusive compute provider, Microsoft. The startup plans to continue increasing its use of Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service, it said, alongside the “additional compute” from Stargate. In March, The Information reported that OpenAI and Microsoft were planning a U.S.-based data center that could cost up to $100 billion and house a supercomputer made up of millions of AI chips — also called “Stargate.” However, after it raised a $6.6 billion funding round in October, The Information reported that OpenAI was looking for other data center deals after its chief financial officer Sarah Friar had previously told some shareholders it wasn’t getting enough compute power fast enough from the tech giant. Microsoft said on Tuesday that a new agreement with OpenAI “includes changes to the exclusivity on new capacity” and will follow a model where Microsoft has the right of first refusal. “To further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI’s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models,” the company said. In an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the company will continue spending $80 billion building out its cloud computing and that “customers can count on Microsoft with OpenAI models being there everywhere in the world.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: People are buying the wrong stock thinking it's part of OpenAI's Stargate Project

MGX stock is soaring Wednesday on the heels of the company’s involvement with OpenAI and SoftBank’s (SFTBY+1.50%) new Stargate project. There’s just one minor problem — it’s the stock ticker for the wrong MGX. MGX represents shares of Metagenomi Inc., a biotechnology company focused on leveraging genome editing tools. Last week, the company said it is working on bringing its experimental treatment for hemophilia A to clinical trials in 2026. Investors were likely confused by a press release announcing that MGX would be among the initial equity funders in the Stargate Project, which seeks to invest $500 billion over the next four years in new artificial intelligence infrastructure for OpenAI. The MGX referenced there is a technology fund based in the United Arab Emirates. The likely misunderstanding propelled Metagenomi stock up by as much as 33% on Wednesday before gains were pared back down to a 25% increase. Shares are down 67% for the last 12 months and 24% over the last six months. As for Stargate, the project is expected to be a major boost to the U.S. economy and OpenAI, according to the people backing it. President Donald Trump, who was joined by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, and Oracle’s (ORCL-1.04%) Larry Ellison at the White House — said it would generate more than 100,000 jobs. The group’s first project, a one-million-square-foot data project, is already underway in Texas. Although the backers plan to eventually spend $500 billion, the companies said they would deploy $100 billion “immediately.” Stargate will be chaired by Son, whose SoftBank will have financial responsibility for the company, while OpenAI handles the operations. Those companies, along with Oracle and MGX, are the initial equity backers. SoftBank-backed Arm, Microsoft (MSFT-0.06%), and Nvidia (NVDA-1.43%) will work with Oracle and OpenAI on the technology. However, not everyone is fully on board with Stargate. Atreides Management Chief Investment Office Gavin Baker, who also noted the MGX mix-up, called the $500 billion “a ridiculous number” that “no one should take seriously” unless SoftBank sold their Arm and Alibaba (BABA+2.62%) stock. “And I say all of this as someone who is really optimistic about AI in every way,” Baker added in a post on X. “Stargate is fiction wrapped around a much less impressive reality.” Tesla (TSLA+0.53%) CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump’s with his own federal task force, agrees. In a series of posts late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday morning, Musk said he has it on “good authority” that SoftBank has less than $10 billion secured. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on X, replying to an OpenAI post announcing Stargate. Musk, an OpenAI co-founder who left the startup and has a longstanding feud with Altman and the startup, also has his own AI company, xAI. His firm raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation. That cash is expected to help xAI expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, which it developed with Nvidia chips.

Title: Elon Musk bashes the $500 billion 'Stargate' deal between OpenAI and SoftBank — and backed by Trump
URL: https://qz.com/elon-musk-stargate-ai-openai-trump-softbank-nvidia-1851744596

Elon Musk is already casting doubt on OpenAI’s new, up to $500 billion investment deal with SoftBank (SFTBY+1.50%) and Oracle (ORCL-1.04%), despite backing from his allies — including President Donald Trump. The companies are teaming up for what they call the “Stargate Project,” presumably named after the sci-fi franchise, which aims to spend $500 billion over the next four years building artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. The companies said Tuesday that they would begin deploying $100 billion “immediately,” which will “generate massive economic benefit for the entire world.” As the deal was announced Tuesday in the White House, Trump — standing alongside Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son — said the group would create a “new American company” that would generate more than 100,000 U.S. jobs. Ellison said the group’s first project, a one-million-square-foot data project, is already underway in Texas. There’s just one problem with Stargate, according to Musk, an OpenAI co-founder who has since sued to block it and Altman’s plans: They don’t have the cash. “They don’t actually have the money,” the Tesla (TSLA+0.53%) CEO and close Trump ally said shortly before midnight on Tuesday, in a post on his social media site X. “SoftBank has well under $10 [billion] secured. I have that on good authority,” Musk added just before 1 a.m. ET. His comments marked a rare split between the world’s richest man and Trump, who took office on Monday. Musk was one of Trump’s biggest financial backers during the 2024 presidential campaign and has been given his own task force, nicknamed DOGE, and staff. The Trump administration is already facing at least four lawsuits over DOGE. Musk’s remarks also show that, despite Altman and Amazon (AMZN-0.35%) founder Jeff Bezos’ comments last month, Musk isn’t content to sit by as his rivals profit from the new Trump administration. Altman said in December that he believes “pretty strongly that Elon would do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power” against business rivals. Besides Musk’s long-standing feud with Altman and litigation, he also founded an AI startup, xAI, to compete with OpenAI and other firms. xAI last month raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, less than two years after he founded the company. That cash is expected to help xAI expand its Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, which it developed with Nvidia (NVDA-1.43%) chips. xAI also works closely with Musk’s X. His social media platform, formerly Twitter, employs Grok, a chatbot developed by his xAI startup. Ellison is an investor in X, formerly served on Tesla’s board, and the pair of billionaires have a longtime friendship. “[I] genuinely respect your accomplishments and think you are the most inspiring entrepreneur of our time,” Altman said Wednesday in reply to Musk’s accusations. Altman followed up by saying that Musk’s allegations are “wrong, as you surely know,” before inviting him to visit the site in Texas. “[T]his is great for the country,” Altman said. “[I] realize what is great for the country isn’t always what’s optimal for your companies, but in your new role [I] hope you’ll mostly put [America] first.” Stargate will be chaired by Son, whose SoftBank will have financial responsibility for the company, while OpenAI handles the operations. Those companies, along with Oracle and MGX, are the initial equity backers. SoftBank-backed Arm, Microsoft (MSFT-0.06%), and Nvidia will work with Oracle and OpenAI on the technology. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told CNBC on Wednesday that “I’m good for my $80 billion. I’m going to spend $80 billion building out Azure.” The initial $100 billion comes from a number of sources, including equity from the founding partners and co-investors, as well as third-party debt, according to a source familiar with the matter. Additional investors are expected to be brought on and help fund the project over its lifetime. “All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI—and in particular AGI—for the benefit of all of humanity,” OpenAI and SoftBank said in a statement. “We believe that this new step is critical on the path, and will enable creative people to figure out how to use AI to elevate humanity.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) has regained the top spot as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $3.46 trillion, above Apple (AAPL, Financial) $3.35 trillion. On Tuesday's trading, Nvidia rose 2.2 percent, and Apple fell 3.1 percent, sharply due to analyst downgrades, citing poor iPhone sales and a lacklustre consumer electronics market. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The fact that AI is dominating the decisions around this historic shift demonstrates why it will take over the economic world. Nvidia's rise is part of a surge in demand for the company's graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are critical for powering AI applications in autonomous vehicles, data centres and other high-growth sectors. Nvidia exceeded 100 percent earnings growth for its third quarter of 2024, along with a 94 percent jump in revenue to $35.1 billion. These results underscore how the company is a key enabler of AI transformations in industries. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said: "Our GPUs are driving the AI-driven transformation across industries." AI is at the heart of every business, and we are entering a new era of computing. Overall, the slowdown in these markets is illustrative of broader strategic issues impacting consumer electronics companies. The company has lost money, with their market cap down to $3.33 trillion compared to a high just a few months ago. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Microsoft relaxes data center grip on OpenAI amid $500 billion joint venture

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Stephen Nellis and Krystal Hu (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday said it has changed some key terms of a deal with OpenAI after the ChatGPT creator announced a joint venture with Oracle (ORCL) and Japan's SoftBank Group to build up to $500 billion of new AI data centers in the United States. President Donald Trump gathered the leaders of the "Stargate" effort at the White House on Tuesday to announce the deal, saying it was intended to help keep the United States ahead of China and other rivals in the global AI race, using chips from Nvidia (NVDA). Since 2019, Microsoft has had arrangements with OpenAI that gave the Redmond, Washington-based company the exclusive right to build new computing infrastructure for OpenAI. Microsoft, in a blog post, said it has "approved OpenAI's ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models." That opened the door for OpenAI to work with Oracle. A person familiar with the deal said that Stargate is a joint venture structured as new entity in which OpenAI has an equity stake, governance rights and operational control. It will have a separate board appointed by the founding members and its own CEO, this person said. The venture will also have other investors including United Arab Emirates firm MGX. Microsoft, along with Nvidia and Arm, will be a "technology partner" in the new venture, but is not listed as an equity funder. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son is will be the entity's board chairman, according to a statement from OpenAI posted on social media site X. But Microsoft said that it still retains the exclusive right to offer OpenAI's API - technology shorthand for application programming interface, which is the main way that software developers and business customers buy OpenAI's services. That means Oracle will not be able to host OpenAI's primary source of revenue. Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Microsoft's statements. Microsoft said it has "revenue sharing agreements that flow both ways" with OpenAI. "The key elements of our partnership remain in place for the duration of our contract through 2030, with our access to OpenAI’s IP, our revenue sharing arrangements and our exclusivity on OpenAI’s APIs all continuing forward," Microsoft said. Microsoft also said "OpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training," referring to Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service.

With a reputation for astute market predictions and exceptional returns, Rokos has established himself as a leading figure in the financial industry. His career trajectory reflects both his expertise in macroeconomic analysis and his ability to manage risk effectively in volatile markets. Chris Rokos was born in 1970 and grew up in the United Kingdom. A brilliant student from an early age, he attended Eton College, one of the UK’s most prestigious schools. He later studied at Pembroke College, Oxford, graduating with a degree in mathematics. Rokos’ strong analytical skills, honed during his academic career, became a foundation for his success in the world of finance.

In 1993, he moved to UBS and later joined the fledgling hedge fund Brevan Howard Asset Management in 2002, a move that would mark a turning point in his career. As one of the co-founders of Brevan Howard, Rokos played a pivotal role in the firm’s rise to prominence. He specialized in global macro trading, focusing on interest rates, currencies, and government bonds. Rokos was one of the firm’s star traders, reportedly generating over $4 billion in profits for the fund during his tenure. Rokos left Brevan Howard in 2012, taking a sabbatical from trading. In 2015, Rokos launched Rokos Capital Management with approximately $3 billion in assets under management (AUM) from institutional investors. The firm focuses on global macroeconomic strategies, leveraging Rokos’ expertise in trading interest rates and currencies. Rokos Capital Management has grown its 13F assets to over $6 billion by the end of the third quarter of 2024, making it one of the largest hedge funds in Europe.

Nvidia (NVDA-1.61%) reclaimed its title as the world’s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple’s (AAPL-0.28%) shares slid. The chipmaker’s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker’s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia’s shares are up 2%. Jefferies (JEF+0.51%) analysts downgraded Apple’s rating to “Underperform” in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple’s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to “be weak,” Jefferies said, “because there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.” Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is “cautious” over demand for Apple’s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone — part of the SE series of smaller iPhones — is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras. “As Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,” Jefferies analysts said in the note. Meanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the “high teens” in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.

We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dumped 3 Tech Stocks and Betting On These 4 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. Chen Tianqiao is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur and investor, best known for founding Shanda Interactive Entertainment, one of the leading internet and gaming companies in China during the early 2000s. Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Through his innovative approach to technology and business, Chen has become one of the pioneers of the online gaming industry and a significant figure in the global tech and neuroscience communities. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Chen Tianqiao was born in 1973 in the Zhejiang province of China. Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry. In 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 Shanda Asset Management's Stake: $121.4 million NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company's investment potential is driven by following several factors. To begin with, the investors may consider the company’s financial growth as a top factor. As illustrated in the report of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per diluted share was 0.78 dollars, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Additionally, the company’s quarterly net income was 19.3 billion dollars, up 16% from the second quarter and up 112% from a year ago. The second most compelling factor that may attract investment is the launch of its project DIGITS, the world’s smallest AI supercomputer capable of running 200B-parameter models. Moreover, the firm has launched the NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of APIs, SDKs, and services that enable developers to integrate OpenUSD, NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies, and generative AI into existing software tools and simulation workflows for industrial and robotic use cases. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

US stocks traded in the green on Tuesday, but tech lagged as investors digested President Donald Trump's first policy moves, with future tariffs on Mexico and Canada front of mind. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. But the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was broadly flat as the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) struggled. Wall Street is bracing for volatility as the new president storms ahead with executive orders and actions, with energy and trade center stage. It's the first day of trading in Trump's second term, as US markets were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Markets got a dose of relief as Trump held off from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes expected by many on his first day in office. China got a surprise reprieve as Trump failed to act on promised high duties on its imports. US stock futures rose, and the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) pulled back from a near two-year high on Monday. But the mood shifted after Trump said later in the day that he was looking at imposing 25% duties for Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1. And Chinese stocks (000300.SS) closed out Tuesday with only slight gains, suggesting investors aren't convinced that a US-China reset is coming to avert a trade war. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell about 4 basis points to around 4.57% early on Tuesday, recovering somewhat from a deeper drop in Asia trading. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been on a ride, rising to a record higher above $109,000 on Monday as Trump was sworn in and the new president issued an official TRUMP "meme coin" token. The leading digital currency then fell steeply early Tuesday after a hoped-for pro-crypto push failed to appear in the first policy actions. It was trading lower but still above $103,000 at last check. The next batch of quarterly earnings will provide more food for thought for investors. Netflix (NFLX) is expected to deliver strong results when it reports after the bell. Meanwhile, earnings at Charles Schwab (SCHW) soared nearly 50% as trading activity climbed by double digits. D.R. Horton (DHI) also beat expectations despite a soft housing market, while 3M Company (MMM) issued optimistic full-year guidance, driven by organic sales growth. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 4% in early trading Tuesday, reversing premarket gains on the first trading day since the inauguration of Donald Trump as the president scrapped a pro-EV policy put into place by his predecessor. On his first day in office, Trump wasted no time shedding the skin of the outgoing administration, revoking 78 executive orders made by former Democratic President Joe Biden during his tenure. One of those Biden-era policies that was revoked mandated that half of the new US cars manufactured be electric by 2030. Other EV stocks fell on the news. Lucid (LCID) tumbled nearly 7% while Rivian (RIVN) slid 5%. Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) stocks were up. US stocks climbed across the board on Tuesday as investors digested President Donald Trump's first wave of executive orders, with future tariffs on China and Mexico at the forefront of stock traders' minds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also climbed about 0.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and other tech megacaps boosted the overall index. Economic data: No notable economic data releases.

The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this).

And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real-time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer up valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of AI chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on if they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/19/stocks-await-more-earnings-after-strong-start-and-better-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. Seventy-nine percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost 30% decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Why Should You Buy This Growth Stock For The Next 5 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks. Kevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500's performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally. He predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year. He also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive. Methodology We first sifted through online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. We then selected the stocks with high 5-year revenue growth and high analysts' upside potential. From those we picked 15 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 5-Year Revenue CAGR: 62.43% Upside Potential as of January 15: 30.72% NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and manufactures GPUs for gaming and professional markets. It also develops AI platforms, high-performance computing solutions, and self-driving car technologies to power industries like gaming, data centers, and automotive. Bank of America maintained its $190 price target for the company recently, suggesting a 27% upside potential. This optimism is driven by the release of Blackwell GPUs, which have already secured 12 months of orders. At CES 2025, the company unveiled Project DIGITS, a personal AI supercomputer powered by the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. This compact system delivers petaflop-level AI performance while operating on standard household electricity. Project DIGITS is designed to empower researchers, data scientists, and students to develop and run large AI models locally. With 128GB of memory and up to 4TB of storage, the system is well-equipped to handle demanding AI workloads. In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved record revenue of $35.1 billion, a 94% year-over-year surge. This was driven by a 112% increase in Data Center revenue to $30.8 billion. GPU revenue has demonstrated robust growth, surging 67% annually over the past three years. This performance is fueled by the demand for computing power necessitated by advancements in AI and ML. Manole Capital Management noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) more than tripled in value over the past year, due to strong AI-related demand and continued revenue growth that exceeds market expectations. Here's what it said in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. As we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
