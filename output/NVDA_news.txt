Title: Liberation Day: Market Implications Of Tariffs

More Wednesday could bring the total to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) While the economic data was a bit softer on the margin last week, markets were likely rattled more by concerns about the upcoming tariff announcements on President Trump’s “Liberation Day,” scheduled for Wednesday, April 2. Though the range of possible outcomes is extensive, the scope and size of the tariffs should be meaningful. Goldman Sachs estimates a five percentage point increase in tariffs trims 1-2% from S&P 500 earnings growth, so they have lowered their 2025 earnings per share growth estimate to 7%. Strategas Research Partners notes that the size of the contemplated tariffs could bring the total size to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union as a group account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Following COVID-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have made progress in diversifying away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., making it likely to remain subject to significant and possibly increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they are targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with many large trading partners as their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP. If sizable tariffs crimp their net exports to the U.S., as would be expected, their economic growth will suffer. The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs this week. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. If value-added taxes (VAT) are included in the reciprocal calculation by the administration, then the tariffs on the European Union will be significantly higher than if only their tariff rates are considered. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S. President Trump’s use of tariffs and threats of additional tariffs has added to the policy uncertainty. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. As we have experienced since mid-February, all other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas Research Partners, stocks usually do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. The poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen, but the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty After a 1.5% decline last week, the S&P 500 sits 9.2% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a plunge of 20.5% since mid-December. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness and that stress intensified last week. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks isn’t yet at levels seen before past recessions. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Beyond Wednesday’s highly anticipated tariff announcements, Friday’s monthly jobs release will be an important marker. If job growth continues, there will be less concern about any drag from increased tariffs pushing the economy into recession. The March unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, but growth in nonfarm payrolls and hours worked should be closely watched for signs of further softness. U.S. Unemployment Rate While the Federal Reserve projects two rate cuts, markets expect three for 2025, with the first in mid-June. These expectations could change quickly depending on this week’s releases. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected If you own your stocks as an investment - just like you’d own an apartment, house, or a farm - look at them as a business. – Warren Buffett Warren Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham, taught him much about investing. Graham’s most essential lessons were to analyze stocks as a business and not react to short-term fluctuations in the quoted price of a stock. Buffett has said that chapters eight and twenty of Benjamin Graham’s “The Intelligent Investor” book are the bedrock of his investment process. Graham thought investors should look at stock holdings as owning a part of various businesses, like being a “silent partner” in a private company. Hence, stocks should be valued as a portion of the company’s intrinsic value, not as something constantly changing in price on the stock market. An investor should take advantage of the stock market’s fickle view of a company or concerns about macroeconomic factors rather than allowing it to dictate what one should do. Valuing stocks as a business and purchasing stock with a “margin of safety” enable investors to ignore the market’s emotional ups and downs. For Graham, the “margin of safety” meant buying at a price below the “indicated or appraised value,” which should allow an investment to provide a reasonable return even if there are errors in the analysis. The recent market turmoil makes it an optimal time to revisit investment first principles. Given the growing downside risk to the economy and the current inflationary environment, investors should find comfort in owning quality companies with pricing power when searching for opportunities during any selloff. Quality is defined as high returns on capital, consistent earnings, and low debt levels, which should help the company survive a possible economic slowdown or tariff-related challenges. For example, consider Constellation Brands (STZ), which is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S. It also owns some wine and spirits brands, but beer accounts for about 80% of its sales. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its beer earnings since almost all its beer is produced in Mexico. It seems unlikely that a tariff headwind will erode the long-term value of its beer brands, even if profitability could be dented in the short term. Corona and Modelo have two of the best growth profiles among beer brands, and alcohol consumption tends to remain relatively unscathed by economic downturns. Notably, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on long-term alcohol consumption which could be a structural headwind. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Constellation boasts a solid balance sheet and free cash flow generation to sustain it through a possible recession or tariff-related disruption. Just as the zenith of economic and earnings optimism in early 2025 gave way to creeping concerns about the durability of growth under pressure from possible tariff increases, maximum pessimism will eventually give way to a better reality. History tells us that better stock returns follow maximum policy uncertainty. Whether next week’s tariff announcement provides that bottom is unclear, but markets have shifted from pricing in a benign environment to a more difficult path. Current data points to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. Macroeconomic forecasting is fraught, so one should still admit that the odds of a recession have risen, and no one truly knows the eventual outcome. Though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies, and the tariffs can be reduced in the short term. In addition, the focus could shift to more market-friendly topics of tax cuts and deregulation. In any case, investors must always deal with uncertainty and unpredictable market volatility. Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham have provided a better blueprint for dealing with this by focusing on the health and valuation of the underlying businesses rather than the macroeconomic environment or the movement of stock prices. This focus doesn’t avoid the volatility but allows one to use it to their advantage if executed correctly. Just as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) keeps more than enough cash to pay insurance claims without touching any stock investments, investors should have enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses to ignore any depressive states of the stock market and perhaps benefit from taking advantage when they invariably occur.

Title: These 100-Year-Old Funds Are Kicking Out Near-10% Dividends

Full Content:
ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster Contributor. Different yield and maturities for bonds and interest on stock exchange screen. Over the last couple of years, we’ve seen a quiet trend in investing—and today we’re going to tap into it with two funds with near 10% dividends. That’s right: enough to pay you back just shy of 10% of your initial buy a year in dividends alone. What’s more, these two income plays—closed-end funds (CEFs), to be precise—have been around for nearly a century, with one dating from 1927 and the other having launched in 1929. That last date, of course, is notorious, as it heralded the start of the worst market crash in history. I bring these two CEFs up now because their long institutional memory gives them a level of reliability that few other funds can match. And there’s something else that favors both of them now, too—that quiet shift I mentioned earlier. I’m talking about the move from growth stocks to value stocks that’s started to pick up momentum in recent months. We can catch a hint of that when we look at the performance of the large caps in the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared to small caps, as shown below by their benchmark index funds: the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA), in orange below, and the small-cap-focused iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), in purple: Large Caps Outperform That nicely sets the table for our two centenarian funds. The General American Investors Company is the oldest of our two CEFs, but not by much. It’s been around since 1927 and holds reliable cash cows like Republic Services (RSG), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A). The fund has delivered an annualized return of 8.9% over the past decade, as of this writing. It’s caught our attention now because, at my CEF Insider service, one of the things we look for is a fund with what I like to call “discount momentum.” That’s where a CEF’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the fund’s underlying portfolio) is still wide but is slowly moving toward par. And that’s the setup we have with GAM now. Take a look. GAM Discount to NAV Currently, GAM trades at a massive 13.3% discount, as you can see above, and that discount has been shrinking over the last year as market volatility prompts more investors to favor value over growth. In the past year, GAM has also paid out a 9.3% dividend, which is a massive amount of income for one fund. Now it is true, that most of the fund’s income is paid out in one big yearly special dividend, so you’ll have to hold on to the fund for a full year to be guaranteed the full payout. But that’s a good thing: At CEF Insider, we see funds as something to be held for the long term. Our second fund, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX) was launched just a couple years after GAM, in 1929. That, of course, sent it headlong into the biggest market crash of them all, and the Great Depression. But that experience was the start of the fund’s build-up of the institutional memory that still helps guide its decisions today. That’s a big part of the reason why we bought ADX in one of our first issues of CEF Insider, back in July 2017. Since then, it has delivered a 193% total return for us, as of this writing, showing its long-term mettle. ADX and GAM take similar approaches, with Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple being common top positions, but ADX also has a large holding of NVIDIA (NVDA), which is part of the reason why the fund has posted a bigger “NAV return” (or the performance of its underlying portfolio, including dividends collected) over the last decade. (ADX’s total NAV return is in orange below.) ADX Outperforms GAM ADX’s strategy isn’t too risky, though, as it emphasizes investing in high-quality, large-cap companies, ensuring both growth potential and dividend reliability. Plus, its total dividend yield of 10.9% for 2024, combined with a relatively low management fee (for a CEF) of only 0.61%, makes ADX one of the cheaper CEFs on the fee front. On average, these funds have fees around 2% on average. What’s unusual about ADX is that it has outperformed the market over the last decade and, over the last couple of years, the gap between its profits and those of the S&P 500—shown by the performance of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), in orange below, has grown wider: ADX Outperforms SPY ADX should trade at a premium for delivering these gains, yet it sports at an 11.4% discount as I write this. That means there’s upside as this “secret” income monster becomes more widely known. The move from growth to value, which we discussed with GAM above, should also help ADX move on to more people’s radar. At this point, you might be wondering which fund is ideal: the cheaper GAM or the higher-performing ADX? Ultimately, what matters with CEFs is that we combine the best funds in different asset classes—and funds with different investment strategies—while maintaining a high level of quality among our picks. That way, when one falters due to a selloff, you can rebalance toward that dip-buying opportunity as another CEF outperforms. CEFs are particularly useful for this kind of rebalancing due to their high dividends (yields average around 8% as I write this). You’ll not only compound your returns by following this approach—you’ll build up a healthy income stream over time, too. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Tesla’s (TSLA-2.90%) status as the “winner” of President Donald Trump’s new auto tariffs didn’t protect it from a tech-led market selloff on Friday, as the stock followed Nvidia (NVDA-3.43%) and the rest of the Magnificent 7 lower after new economic numbers pointed toward the possibility of stagflation. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7%, the S&P 500 declined 2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average shed 715.8 points, or 1.7%. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL-0.60%) led the Mag 7 lower, plunging 4.9%, Amazon’s (AMZN-1.89%) stock fell 4.3%, Tesla slid 3.5%, and Nvidia eased 1.6%. The personal consumption report for February released Friday showed the core PCE deflator — the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation measure — heating up while real household spending weakened. That creates a situation where the Fed is torn between curtailing price gains and supporting growth. “Today’s report highlights the difficult predicament the Fed is now confronting,” Citigroup (C-0.14%) economists wrote. “Ultimately, we expect Fed officials to dovishly lean toward their full-employment mandate, but that would depend on upcoming data and in particular on ... March spending and inflation.” Trump’s trade war is also weighing on investors. The 25% tariffs on all car, truck, and auto part imports that the president announced Wednesday evening continued to depress automakers’ stocks Friday, with Stellantis (STLA-1.54%) dropping 4.1%, Ford (F+2.57%) down 2%, and General Motors (GM+0.47%) off 1.1%. The ADRs of Toyota (TM-1.43%), Volkswagen (VWAGY-3.51%) and Honda (HMC-0.68%) also declined. Separately, Lululemon’s (LULU-2.80%) stock plunged 14% after the athleisure wear maker’s sales and profit projections missed analyst expectations. The company has scrambled to update its product line to compete with trendier brands, Reuters (TRI+0.35%) reported. Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, said he was surprised by the relatively benign market reaction to the auto tariffs, which were more hawkish than he’d anticipated. He now expects new duties on April 2 to also be hawkish, possibly followed by another muted reaction from investors. Chairman Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers will probably wait longer to see the impact of Trump’s tariffs, especially on inflation, before making any decision on cutting rates, Grisanti told Quartz. “The only way I see Trump getting the Fed on his side is if he tanks the economy,” Grisanti said. “We can slice and dice these economic numbers as much as we want, but the Fed is on hold until we get some tariff clarity.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares in CoreWeave (CRWV), a cloud computing company backed by Nvidia (NVDA), ended their market debut flat following a $1.5 billion initial public offering that priced below its expected range. Shares of CoreWeave opened at $39 Friday. It ended the day at $40, its IPO price, trading as high as almost $42 and as low as around $37.50. The company's IPO pricing lagged the expected range of $47 to $55 per share. CoreWeave, which makes money by providing its clients with access to data centers, had also cut the deal's size, selling 37.5 million shares, fewer than the 49 million previously anticipated. Data centers are used to develop artificial intelligence models. The company, which relies on Microsoft (MSFT) for a large portion of its sales, also depends on Nvidia chips for its business. The IPO was the largest by a tech firm in the U.S. since the $5.2 billion offering by chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM) in September 2023, according to Dealogic, and the largest in the U.S. since the $1.75 billion listing by LNG exporter Venture Global in January. CoreWeave was founded in 2017 as a crypto miner before pivoting to selling cloud infrastructure. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect fresh trading data.

Pulling numbered balls out of a mixing machine. Tracking the twitch of a mouse cursor. Converting lava lamp motion into data.

You can opt out anytime. Transmitting that randomness over the Internet, however, is a different story. Physically random processes are hard to verify remotely, and by design, traditional computers can’t generate true randomness. But a new quantum breakthrough may have solved the problem. Published yesterday (May 26) in Nature, a study from JPMorgan Chase researchers—alongside collaborators at Argonne and Oak Ridge national labs and the University of Texas at Austin—demonstrates how a quantum computer generates “certified” randomness. Quantum computers don’t use ordinary bits but qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once and collapse into intrinsically random outcomes. Using a 56-qubit quantum computer from Quantinuum, the researchers produced random numbers that were then verified by classic supercomputers. “It’s the first experimental demonstration of the use of a quantum computer to generate certified random numbers,” said Scott Aaronson, the UT Austin professor who introduced the randomness protocol used in the study, in an interview with Observer. Quantum computing has attracted increasing attention from tech and financial firms, which hope to use it to solve problems today’s supercomputers cannot. JPMorgan’s Marco Pistoia, head of global tech applied research, called the result a major milestone—not just for quantum hardware but also for fields like statistical sampling, simulation and cryptography. Even so, certified randomness won’t be hitting your phone tomorrow. Aaronson noted that verifying the results is still costly. “I don’t expect this to be an application that changes the world,” he said. “But it is one of the first uses of a quantum computer for anything that I couldn’t say for certain is useless.” JPMorgan isn’t alone in chasing quantum breakthroughs, which, by some estimates, could grow by $2 trillion in the next 15 years. In early 2025, Google (GOOGL) unveiled Willow, a quantum chip that completes in five minutes a benchmark task that would take today’s best supercomputers 10 septillion years. In February, Microsoft (MSFT) created its Majorana 1 chip using a rare new state of matter known as a “topological state.” Even Nvidia (NVDA)’s Jensen Huang—who once tanked quantum stocks by questioning the field’s relevance—has softened his stance. Earlier this month, the chipmaking executive walked back his critique while announcing a new Nvidia-backed quantum research facility in Boston.

Stocks’ losses eased after data showed the labor market holding up and fourth-quarter economic growth was revised higher. The good news helped temper the impact of Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on cars, trucks and auto parts — which sent General Motors (GM+0.47%) and some peers down. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated after fourth-quarter GDP growth was revised up 2.4% annually from 2.3%, reflecting higher investment and a downward revision to import growth. New filings for jobless benefits remained steady in the week to March 22, as did continuing claims for the priror week. “Hard to see recession in these data, but the real test will be the initial read on Q1 2025 GDP, when the trade shocks feed into the numbers — that may not look so rosy,” Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in an email. “The labor market is far stronger and resilient than folks appreciate.” Automakers weren’t a big beneficiary of the batter data, as they face higher costs under Trump’s tariffs that they’ll either have to absorb or pass on to customers. JPMorgan (JPM+0.23%) downgraded its price targets for GM, Ford (F+2.57%) and Ferrari (RACE-0.99%). GM stock plunged 6.5%, Ford declined 2%, and Stellantis (STLA-1.54%) fell 1.5%. The U.S.-traded shares of some foreign automakers slid, with Toyota (TM-1.43%) and Honda (HMC-0.68%) both falling more than 2%. Ferrari reversed an earlier decline after saying it’ll raise American prices for its cars by up to 10% after the tariffs go into effect April 2. Tesla (TSLA-2.90%), one of the automakers least affected by the tariffs, rebounded from initial lows to trade more than 3% higher.

Title: Why May 15 is a key date to watch for Nvidia stock

Nvidia investors have a key catalyst on the horizon, according to Bank of America. Strategists at the bank are watching May 15, the day the US government will roll out the so-called AI Diffusion Rule, a regulatory framework that aims to control foreign countries' access to high-tech chips from the US. The rules would impose restrictions on some sales of Nvidia's chips and potentially narrow its market, but the event could actually end up being positive for Nvidia stock. That's because the company could recover from its recent slump once wider geopolitical concerns are "sized and priced," the bank said on Thursday. "There is a wide range of outcomes, and NVDA stock could stay volatile till the May-15 date, aka 'Liberation Day' as a catalyst when the impact could be reflected in the stock," strategists said. There are several other catalysts that could boost Nvidia stock, the bank said. Strategists pointed to a potential recovery in GM, which announced a partnership with Nvidia earlier this month, as well as Nvidia's new Blackwell Ultra chip. In its most recent earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's existing Blackwell chip was "extraordinary." "Meanwhile, we believe the stock is providing a particularly attractive opportunity for one of the most unique, high-quality tech franchises leading the largest and fastest growing secular trends," the bank said. Bank of America reiterated its "Buy" rating on the chipmaker and issued a price target of $200 a share, implying 75% upside from current levels. The stock was trading around $113 on Thursday morning and is down 18% year-to-date. After back-to-back years of stellar growth, Nvidia stock has lost momentum this year thanks to budding concerns about US AI dominance, as well as jitters related to tariffs and the outlook for the economy. Earlier this month, investors had their eyes set on Nvidia's GPU Tech Conference, dubbed the "Super Bowl of AI," where Huang gave key updates on the firm's new projects and what it sees for the path ahead. Shares have sagged this week on news that Nvidia is at risk of losing business in China, thanks to new energy-efficiency rules that would bar sales of some chips. The stock fell as much as 5% Wednesday morning and edged lower another 1% on Thursday. Jump to

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares lost ground Thursday as Jefferies analysts downgraded the stock, saying they expect the performance gap between AMD's latest products and Nvidia's (NVDA) to widen. The analysts downgraded AMD's stock to a "hold" and cut their price target to $120, down from a "buy" rating and $135 price target previously. That's well below the $139 average target of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, five of whom have issued "hold" ratings, compared to seven "buy" and one "sell" rating. AMD shares were down close to 4% near $106 in recent trading Thursday, and have lost more than 40% of their value over the last 12 months. Citing performance tests conducted with three open-source artificial intelligence (AI) models in recent weeks, Jefferies wrote that Nvidia's H200 graphics processing unit (GPU) still has a "significant performance advantage" over AMD's MI300x, and that they expect the gap could "expand further" with Nvidia's Rubin and Blackwell lines. Nvidia's GPU "outperformed AMD by a wide margin" across most of the analysts' tests. Despite AMD's product having some advertised advantages like higher memory bandwidth, they "do not result in superior real-world performance," the analysts wrote. They also said "expectations of mounting competition" from Intel (INTC) contributed to the downgrade, as they believe Intel could have "fairly competitive chips" by next year under its new CEO.

Title: Here are the chips that Nvidia can sell to China

After the U.S. placed chip-export controls on China in October 2022 to curb the country’s technological advances, U.S.-based chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) designed less-powerful versions of its artificial intelligence chips to continue its presence in the Chinese market while complying with the rules. Nvidia’s most advanced A100 and H100 chips were blocked under the restrictions, leading it to develop the reduced-capability A800 and H800 chips. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used the H800s to train and develop its AI models that rattled Silicon Valley and Wall Street earlier this year. However, under updated chip-export controls introduced in October 2023, those graphics processing units, or GPUs, were also banned, prompting the company to develop three more compliant chips. Now, concerns are mounting over whether Nvidia will be able to sell these specially-designed chips for much longer, as trade tensions between the U.S. and China rise. China and Hong Kong are the chipmaker’s fourth-largest market, representing about 13% of its annual revenue — or $17.1 billion — for fiscal year 2025, according to Nvidia’s Form 10-K. Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced new U.S. trade restrictions against dozens of Chinese tech firms, citing national security and foreign policy concerns — a continuation of the years long effort to maintain the U.S. lead in chips and AI. Here are three chips Nvidia can sell to China. To comply with the updated chip-export controls, Nvidia developed the H20, which is a modified version of its more powerful H100 GPUs that are used by major firms such as Google (GOOGL) and Meta (META). The H20 has become its most prominent chip in the Chinese market. The H20 has a reduced core count making it lower performing but still able to deliver AI capabilities. This week, H3C — one of China’s largest server makers — warned that the country could face potential shortages of the H20, as demand has grown significantly since DeepSeek’s boom. The L20 is based on Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace architecture, and was built on the 5 nanometer process. The L20 is a modified version of the AD102 — Nvidia’s flagship GPU. The AD102 can support gaming and AI. The L2 is based on the Ada Lovelace architecture, and is a modified version of the AD104 GPU.

Title: CoreWeave (CRWV) IPO Turns Into An Epic Disaster As NVIDIA Forced To Step In With A $250 Million Anchor Investment

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. We warned in early March that CoreWeave's IPO, one of the most anticipated public flotation events of the year, faced a growing chorus of headwinds, including moderating GPU prices, data center excess capacity risks courtesy of Microsoft's recent retrenchment in this space, and sustainability concerns around CoreWeave's revenue trajectory. Well, all of these factors are now coming to a head just as the company is about to go public. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, CoreWeave is a cloud company that specializes in handling GPU-intensive AI workloads. Over the past few years, the company has carved out for itself a winning niche: it has created a unique partnership with NVIDIA to be among the first to offer access to NVIDIA's latest-gen GPUs at scale, all packaged within an infrastructure that has been optimized to handle AI workloads, replete with "sub-microsecond" network latency and an effective GPU lifecycle management system. Basically, CoreWeave rents out NVIDIA's latest GPUs, packaged with various bells and whistles designed to attract AI startups. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Originally, CoreWeave planned to raise at least $4 billion via an IPO that would value the company at $35 billion. Scoop: CoreWeave is planning to downsize its IPO and cut the price — I'm hearing closer to the $23B valuation it had in the private market a year ago than the ~$30B it wanted. — Liz Hoffman (@lizrhoffman) March 27, 2025 However, in what amounted to an inauspicious start to CoreWeave's IPO day, Semafor reported earlier today that the company was now targeting a $23 billion valuation. *COREWEAVE IS SAID PLANNING TO CUT IPO SIZE TO ABOUT $1.5B Was supposed to be $3BN. Couldn't fill half the orderbook. This is very bad for revenue roundtripping schemes https://t.co/adSrC6vqjy — zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 27, 2025 Then, reports emerged that CoreWeave could not manage to fill even half of its orderbook and that the company would now raise just $1.5 billion in its IPO instead of its targeted cash raise of $4 billion. This IPO is a total disaster: NVDA forced to step in and "anchor" the IPO with a $250MM order at $40 per CNBC Without NVDA, which already owns 5% of CRWV, IPO would bust https://t.co/GS9rPpneGb — zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 27, 2025 Next, CNBC is now reporting that the prevailing situation has compelled NVIDIA to step in with a $250 million investment to anchor CoreWeave's IPO at $40 per share. Of course, TD Cowen's latest note is likely to have played a role in souring the sentiment around CoreWeave's IPO. As a refresher, TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias recently leveraged his channel checks to note that Microsoft's data center lease cancelations are "more pervasive" than previously thought, prompting investors to question the sustainability of the ongoing AI-related CapEx. Specifically, Elias calculated that Microsoft appears to have walked away - via lease deferrals and outright cancelations - from over 2GW of data center capacity in the US and the EU over the past six months. While Elias concedes that Microsoft's decision not to support OpenAI's training workloads might have partially prompted this retrenchment, he goes on to declare that the prevailing paradigm "points to data center oversupply relative to its current demand forecast." Of course, do note that Google and Meta have stepped forward to reclaim some of Microsoft's recently freed data center capacity. Bear in mind that Microsoft was responsible for 62 percent of CoreWeave's revenue in 2024. And, the tech giant previously intended to spend over $10 billion on CoreWeave's services by 2030. Elsewhere, concerns continue to linger around CoreWeave's revenue and cash burn trajectory. The company burned $1.1 billion in cash in 2023, and a whopping $6 billion in 2024, courtesy of its gigantic CapEx to build out AI infrastructure. As of the end of 2024, CoreWeave housed over 250,000 GPUs from NVIDIA across its 32 data centers, with the Hopper architecture constituting the vast majority of these GPUs. Due to its relentless cash needs, CoreWeave has raised $14.5 billion in financing via 12 funding rounds. It currently has a debt load of around $11 billion. Critically, most of CoreWeave's debt stock is secured against its gigantic stash of NVIDIA GPUs. However, with an hour of GPU compute trading at just $2 at the end of 2024 vs. the $8 per hour price tag earlier in the year, some remain concerned about the health of CoreWeave's GPU collateral. CoreWeave does have one thing going for it: consider the fact that its 2024 revenue increased by 737 percent year-over-year to $1.92 billion from just $229 million in revenue that it recorded in 2023. Nonetheless, the company has yet to show a profit, having reported a net loss of $863 million in 2024, and $594 million in 2023. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Apple might up its AI game with a $1 billion order of Nvidia servers, analyst says

Apple (AAPL+1.20%) has traditionally not been a big player in artificial intelligence model training or server infrastructure. But that might change pretty soon. “Apple is officially in the large server cluster Gen AI game... and Super Micro Computer (SMCI-1.08%) & Dell (DELL-2.44%) are the key server partners,” Loop Capital Markets analyst Ananda Baruah said in an analyst note on Monday. Large server clusters are big groups of high-powered servers used to train and run complex AI models, like those used in generative AI. The tech giant is reportedly placing roughly $1 billion worth of orders of Nvidia’s (NVDA-3.43%) GB300 NVL72 server platform, including the company’s next-generation Blackwell Ultra chips, built by Super Micro and Dell. With each server costing around $3.7 million to $4 million, Baruah estimates that Apple is buying approximately 250 servers. Apple didn’t immediately respond to Quartz’s request for comment. Baruah expects Apple to use these servers to run or train generative AI large language models. The move could have stemmed from the intense backlash Apple received in response to its decision to delay a much-anticipated generative AI upgrade of its voice assistant Siri. Apple began working on integrating advanced AI technology into its products as part of its Apple Intelligence initiative, which the company introduced last June at its annual developer conference, WWDC. The tech giant first teased a so-called “LLM Siri” based on advanced large language models last year, in an effort to scale its generative AI capabilities and catch up to industry rivals like OpenAI and Amazon. Although an arrival date was never publicly set, LLM Siri was widely anticipated to come in an iOS 18.4 upgrade expected next month. Now, the AI-infused Siri will likely be unveiled next year. Apple pulled its previous ads featuring the capability. The decision to delay LLM Siri’s rollout faced intense investor and consumer backlash, and the company was hit with a federal lawsuit last week. The suit demands unspecified financial damages on behalf of those who purchased new products in anticipation of the generative AI upgrade. “Apple’s advertisements saturated the internet, television, and other airwaves to cultivate a clear and reasonable consumer expectation that these transformative features would be available upon the iPhone’s release,” the lawsuit said. Loop Capital analysts’ initial work suggests that the LLM Siri debacle could partly be due to Apple’s preference to use traditional AI and machine learning, rather than more advanced generative AI. But Apple’s alleged purchase of these servers could signal a shift in preference towards the latter, Baruah said.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA-3.43%) were down by around 6% during mid-day trading on Wednesday after a report that its business in China could be negatively impacted by new government rules. The stock traded around $113.48 as of 3:20 p.m. New York Time. China’s National Development and Reform Commission has asked firms in the country to use energy-efficient chips in new data centers and those that are being expanded, the Financial Times reported, citing documents reviewed by the publication. The H20 chip, which was developed by Nvidia to comply with U.S. export controls, reportedly does not meet the new requirements introduced by the economic planning agency. Nvidia executives are reportedly seeking a meeting with Zheng Shanjie, the chair of the commission, to discuss the rules. It has also reportedly adjusted the chip to meet the energy efficiency rules. People told the Financial Times that companies such as Alibaba (BABA-0.48%) and Tencent (TCEHY-1.88%) have been advised by the commission to not buy the less-powerful Nvidia processors. However, the people said that H20 sales are not currently being impacted, because the rules have yet to be strictly enforced. Meanwhile, Chinese tech giants have reportedly increased orders for the H20 chips after Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the industry with its R1 reasoning models in January. China and Hong Kong are the chipmaker’s fourth-largest market, representing about 13% of its annual revenue — or $17.1 billion — for fiscal 2025, according to Nvidia’s Form 10-K. “Our products provide superb energy efficiency and value in every market we serve,” Nvidia said in a statement to the Financial Times. “As technology moves rapidly, export control policy should be adjusted to allow U.S. firms to offer the most energy-efficient products possible, while still achieving the Administration’s national security goals.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

AI hyperscaler's IPO could raise $2.5 billion, but Jeffrey Emanuel says it's a turkey When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Towards the end of January 2025, Jeffrey Emanuel, Founder and CEO of Pastel Network, wrote an interesting and insightful essay about Nvidia. More specifically, he discussed what he saw as its overvaluation and the threat it faced from a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek. noting, “history shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits,” and that, “Nvidia faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies.” That article, which went viral, helped cause the largest-ever single-day drop in the stock market, wiping $2 trillion off global markets and slashing Nvidia’s market capitalization by $600 billion. The latest target of Emanuel’s observations is Roseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave, which offers cloud infrastructure optimized for Nvidia GPUs and is expected to go public in the coming weeks in what will be a closely watched IPO. In his takedown of the company, Emanuel described it as the “WeWork of AI,” referring to the infamous flexible office space startup that was once valued at $47 billion but overexpanded, mismanaged funds, and collapsed after a failed IPO. As Emanuel wrote two weeks ago, “If it [CoreWeave] really IPOs for $30b+ then it’s a much better short than NVDA ever was. They have absolutely no durable moat and will soon be structurally disadvantaged on the cost curve for inference for specific LLM models versus hyperscalers like AWS, which have their own proprietary silicon (because clearly CoreWeave doesn’t know the first thing about making custom silicon, and won’t anytime soon).” MarketWatch picked up on this and cautioned investors. The site wrote, “CoreWeave set an estimated price range of $47 to $55 a share for its initial public offering, and an offering size of 49 million shares. Based on the midpoint of the estimated range, CoreWeave’s IPO would raise $2.5 billion for the company. That would make its IPO the fourth since 2022 to raise at least $2.5 billion, after Lineage, Arm Holdings, and Kenvue, according to Renaissance Capital.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “CoreWeave would have a market cap of about $25 billion based on the midpoint of the estimated pricing range,” the site added. While that’s far less than the $35 billion many market watchers have been predicting, Emanuel says, “that’s still at least $20b too high for this turkey!” Thanks to Steve Gelsi at @MarketWatch for helping me warn investors about the CoreWeave IPO. Luckily, they've already had to reduce the valuation by $10b from the initial price talk of $35b, but that's still at least $20b too high for this turkey! https://t.co/fnJorj87NkMarch 20, 2025 Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.
