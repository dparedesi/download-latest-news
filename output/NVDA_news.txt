Title: Qualcomm Stock Is Soaring Today After Chipmaker Makes a Big AI Move

Qualcomm is joining the competition to supply chips for AI data centers. Qualcomm (QCOM), which has largely focused on chips for mobile phones, laptops and other consumer devices to date, on Monday unveiled two AI accelerator chips for data centers: the AI200, which is set for release in 2026, and the AI250, which is planned for 2027. Shares of Qualcomm were up more than 13% in recent trading, pacing gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. With Monday's gains, they've added about one-quarter of their value in 2025. Qualcomm's expansion into the market for data center chips comes as a growing number of companies look to capitalize on booming demand for AI with products catering to data centers. The share prices of many of those companies have surged, helping power the broader stock market to record highs. The move marks a big step for Qualcomm, which said that it will be committed to a data center roadmap with an annual cadence for major releases or updates going forward. It could also mean more competition for leading AI chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with several analysts suggesting in recent weeks that they see Nvidia's dominant market share diminishing over time as competition and demand grows. Shares of Nvidia were up 2.5% in recent trading amid a broader market rally, while AMD shares were up slightly after hitting an all-time high at the open.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-october-27-2025-11837323
Time Published: 2025-10-27T12:25:33Z

Stock futures are pointing to a sharply higher open this morning after major indexes closed last week at record highs; investor sentiment is getting a boost after President Donald Trump said he was optimistic the U.S. would reach a trade deal with China and address ownership of social media app TikTok; Avidity Biosciences (RNA) shares are surging after Swiss pharmaceutical maker Novartis (NVS) said it would acquire the biotechnology firm; and U.S.-listed shares of Argentine companies are soaring after President Javier Milei’s political party posted victories in legislative elections there. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher this morning amid optimism about an apparent easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, while investors prepare for an expected rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a flurry of earnings reports from major technology companies later in the week. The three major U.S. stock indexes come into today's session at record highs after each gained about 2% last week following a mild inflation report that reaffirmed expectations that the Fed will cut its key rate on Wednesday. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.5% recently, while those linked to the the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively. Bitcoin was trading at $115,400, up from a low over the weekend around $111,000. Gold futures were down 2.6% at $4,030 an ounce, as the precious metal continues to step back from recent highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, rose to 4.02% from 4.00% at Friday's close. Crude oil futures were down slightly at around $61.40 after jumping last week following a move by the U.S. to place sanctions on Russian oil firms. President Donald Trump said early Monday that the U.S. is positioned to reach a trade deal with China, as the the president gets set to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea. "I have a lot of respect for President Xi, and we are going to come away with the deal,” Trump said. U.S. and Chinese negotiators over the weekend reached a framework for a trade deal that could result in a reduction of tariffs and trade barriers between the two countries. The deal will reportedly delay the implementation of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports that were slated to begin on Nov. 1, while China’s export controls on rare earth elements are also expected to be delayed as the two sides continue negotiations. Trump also expects the two countries to reach a deal on ownership of the social media app TikTok. The U.S. also announced that separate trade and mineral agreements were reached with Malaysia and Cambodia, while trade pact frameworks were struck with Thailand and Vietnam. Shares of U.S. chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which are seeking to sell into Chinese markets, were both up more than 2% in premarket trading. Trump said that the U.S. will slap an additional 10% tariff on Canadian goods after the Ontario provincial government ran an ad criticizing tariffs during the World Series on Friday. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that broadcasts of the ad would end on Monday. Trump has criticized the ad for featuring comments from former President Ronald Reagan, which he described as a “serious misrepresentation of the facts.” Trump had placed a tariff of 35% on Canadian goods not covered by the USMCA agreement, though tariffs on some products like steel and aluminum are subject to levies of 50%. Trump had previously said trade negotiations with Canada would be “terminated” over the ad. Shares of Avidity Biosciences (RNA) are soaring in premarket trading after Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis (NVS) agreed to buy the biotechnology company in a deal valued at $12 billion. Avidity will spin off part of its early-stage precision cardiology business before closing the deal in the first half of 2026, Novartis said in a statement. “The Avidity team has built robust programs with industry-leading delivery of RNA therapeutics to muscle tissue,” Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said. “We look forward to developing these programs to meaningfully change the trajectory of diseases for patients.” Shares of Avidity jumped more than 40% ahead of the opening bell, while Novartis shares were down about 1%. Shares of U.S.-listed Argentine companies are surging after President Javier Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party won a landslide legislative victory. President Donald Trump had offered to provide financial support for Argentina but said that the bailout hinged on the outcome of the election. "BIG WIN in Argentina for Javier Milei, a wonderful Trump Endorsed Candidate?," Trump said on Truth Social. Shares of financial services companies Grupo Financiero Galicia SA (GGAL), Banco BBVA Argentina SA (BBAR) and Banco Macro SA (BMA) each gained more than 30% in premarket trading. Shares of oil company YPF (YPF) jumped about 25%, while shares of e-commerce firm MercadoLibre (MELI) added 7%.

Wall Street is back in rally mode. The US stock market today is surging as investors cheer signs of a possible Trump-Xi trade deal. Dow futures are up 250 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both higher — and traders are betting on a major Fed rate cut this week. Markets are now turning their focus to Trump’s high-stakes Asia trip. He’s set to meet China’s President Xi on Thursday, and early talks hint at “a substantial framework” for an agreement, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Across Asia, stocks are exploding higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 smashed through 50,000 for the first time ever. Kospi, Hang Seng, and Shanghai Composite are all in the green.

Title: Microsoft Reports Earnings This Week: Here's What Investors Need To Know

Microsoft is slated to report quarterly results after markets close Wednesday, and Wall Street analysts expect another solid showing. “We view MSFT as the clear front-runner on the enterprise hyper-scale AI front despite increasing competition from Amazon/AWS and Google/GCP,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note last week. Analysts expect Microsoft to report adjusted earnings grew 11% to $3.68 per share in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Wall Street is looking for revenue from Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, to increase by about 38% to around $23 billion, while total revenue is expected to increase 15% to $75.5 billion. With its array of businesses spanning cloud computing, enterprise software and personal computing, Microsoft’s earnings can signal both the strength of AI demand and the health of the broader economy. As America’s third-most valuable company, Microsoft's stock has a greater impact than most on investors’ portfolios. Many analysts say anecdotal evidence points to an even stronger quarter than Wall Street is expecting. The feedback Deutsche Bank analysts have received from Microsoft customers “reflects an overwhelmingly positive consensus on Microsoft's fundamental and competitive standing,” they wrote in a note Thursday. Citi analysts also noted their conversations with Microsoft partners were resoundingly positive, with corporate and public customers indicating strong demand for Azure. Bank of America analysts are forecasting total first-quarter revenue of $77 billion, but expect as much as 1% upside to that estimate, “driven by workload migration to Azure, strength in security and applications.” Wedbush concurred, calling Microsoft's forecast of 37% Azure growth "relatively conservative." Microsoft is coming off a very strong earnings report in July, when it beat top- and bottom-line estimates and indicated cloud computing demand continued to outstrip supply. To meet that demand, the company estimated it would spend $30 billion on infrastructure in the most recent quarter. Microsoft’s infrastructure spending will be one of the most closely watched figures in this week’s results. Its spending on cloud and AI data centers has fueled exponential sales growth at chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). This week’s earnings from Microsoft and big tech peers Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) will give Wall Street insight into the strength of the quarter for Nvidia and other AI infrastructure suppliers. Bank of America analysts expect Microsoft’s full-year capital expenditures will total $125 billion, $10 billion more than the Wall Street consensus. “We are bullish on upward revisions to Microsoft's CapEx, which would likely be a catalyst for the stock,” the analysts wrote. Microsoft shares have treaded water since popping on last quarter’s earnings report. The stock is down about 2% since the end of July, while the Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 10%. BofA attributes the underperformance to a shift in “AI infrastructure momentum away from Microsoft (to Oracle),” which last quarter reported a massive jump in orders from Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Saying that infrastructure spending will exceed prior estimates could help Microsoft regain that momentum, according to BofA. Uncertainty about Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI has also been an overhang for the stock, according to Deutsche Bank. The two companies last month signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to extend their partnership, but much remains to be negotiated, including Microsoft’s access to OpenAI’s intellectual property and programming interfaces, as well as how ownership of OpenAI’s for-profit division will be structured. “How things may shake out across these key pillars is unclear, but we believe skeptics are underappreciating Microsoft's strong position to extract value here,” wrote Deutsche Bank’s Brad Zelnick and Bhavin Shah.

Title: Meta Is Set to Report Earnings on Wednesday—What You Need to Know

Meta has big AI goals, but can it convince investors to keep supporting its big spending? The company's progress with AI will be in focus when the social media giant reports third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching closely for signs its investments are paying off. Meta Platforms (META), which expanded its capital expenditures projections twice this year to support its data center buildouts and hefty compensation packages for poached AI talent, could now face a higher bar to impress with its results. Bank of America analysts said last week they're calling for a revenue beat of $50 billion driven by ad gains to support Meta's spending, slightly above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha at $49.54 billion—which would represent a record high. Meanwhile, the mean estimate for Meta's earnings per share at $6.71 would suggest year-over-year growth, but a decline from the previous quarter. Recent reports of layoffs and hiring freezes could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to rein in costs. Meta has been more successful than many of its other big tech peers so far this year in convincing investors to support its AI goals. Thursday's results could represent the next big test to show it's made the revenue gains to justify its spending. Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the social media giant's stock heading into the results, with all but one of the 21 analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha calling it a "buy" compared to just one "hold" rating. Their mean price target near $873 would suggest roughly 18% upside from Friday's close.

Title: S&P 500 Surges: Magnificent 7 Earnings, Rate Cut, And AI Boom Drive Q3

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its busiest week, which includes an earnings report from five of the Magnificent 7 and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). 173 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Boeing (BA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). With 29% of companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 9.2% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar years 2025 and 2026 is unchanged at 11.0% and 13.9%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. In addition, the better-than-expected consumer inflation reading opened the door to a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, which helped stocks, particularly banks. The lack of additional “cockroaches” last week helped regional banks snap back from concerns over reported loan fraud. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings were below expectations last week, and it was the only member of the Magnificent 7 that saw a stock price decline last week. Five of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week: Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the financials, information technology, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF) and Chubb (CB) were the most significant positive drivers. Intel (INTC) was the most crucial positive surprise in technology, while RTX (RTX) and GE Aerospace (GE) were the most notable positive surprises in industrials. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. However, sales growth at 7.0% is running well above expectations. So far this earnings season, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors have been the most critical drivers of improved sales growth. The government shutdown delayed September consumer inflation (CPI) readings, but the headline and core, excluding food and energy, were better than expected. The headline and core CPI were 3% year-over-year. The top-line numbers were more favorable than expected, despite concerns about price pressure from tariffs. In addition, the details were similarly comforting, with the pace of price gains for services and housing slowing. The 3-month annualized rate of CPI growth held steady, suggesting the recent inflation acceleration might be subsiding. With the government shutdown dragging on and delaying or withholding many US economic releases, the focus will be on the busiest week of the earnings season. In addition, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings. This group has an outsized impact on the S&P 500’s expected earnings growth rate. It is also an essential bellwether for gauging the health of the artificial intelligence boom and the technology sector as a whole. Despite the government shutdown, tariffs, and a cooling labor market, the economy continues to hold up well, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 4%. President Trump is scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi this week, and markets anticipate some thawing in tensions between the countries, though a full-scale trade deal is unlikely. The friendlier inflation data last week sealed the deal for another 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at their meeting on Wednesday. Financial markets expect another cut at the December meeting. Given the additional economic visibility issues arising from the government shutdown, management’s forward earnings guidance will be even more closely watched. Since the Fed rate cut is a virtual certainty, Chair Powell’s comments about the future path of monetary policy will be closely watched. He is unlikely to be forceful in his views, given the lack of visibility into the health of the labor market, but shouldn’t buck expectations for another Fed easing in December.

Shares of a major automaker surged Friday on a strong earnings report, while a shoes and apparel maker lost ground after warning tariffs and higher prices could discourage shoppers. Major U.S. equities indexes finished the week at record highs after the release of a cooler-than-expected inflation report, reinforcing expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week. The Nasdaq rose 1.2%, the S&P 500 added 0.8%, and the Dow climbed 1% to finish above 47000 for the first time. All three indexes posted roughly 2% gains for the week. See here for more coverage from Investopedia of Friday's market moves. Ford Motor (F) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Friday, soaring over 12% after the automaker posted third-quarter earnings that topped analysts' estimates. The strong results overshadowed a cut to Ford's outlook, related to the impacts of a fire at an aluminum supplier. Shares of other big automakers, including General Motors (GM), also rose. Tesla (TSLA), which reported quarterly results late Wednesday, finished more than 3% lower. Shares of International Business Machines (IBM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped nearly 8% to finish at record highs following a report that IBM found it could run a key quantum computing error-correcting algorithm on an easy-to-get and reasonably priced chip made by AMD. Micron Technology (MU), which supplies memory solutions for AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) chips, also gained following the news, adding 6%. The SOX index of semiconductor stocks finished the day up 1.9%. Deckers Outdoor (DECK) shares plunged more than 15% to lead decliners on the benchmark index. The Ugg and Hoka shoe maker gave a weaker-than-expected outlook, saying it anticipates a pullback in consumer spending because of tariffs and higher prices. Shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold miner, fell 6.2% amid concerns about its production outlook, though its third-quarter results topped analysts' estimates as the price of gold has lately surged.

It seems it took nearly a year for Apple just to move a couple of points higher to get an ATH, thanks to A.I. mania pulling all the money from investors. It’s just crazy how a few CEOs can move the whole market direction based on deception and FOMO. Many companies that are spending huge amounts of money on A.I. capex aren’t even profitable. Fundamentals have been tossed aside for possible future gains. Yet when someone says iPhone sales MIGHT be flat, investors panic and sell. It’s so weird. Anyway, I’m glad Apple hasn’t thrown away tens of billions on A.I. nonsense. I prefer human intelligence over A.I. intelligence. Maybe someday people will wake up when a quarter of U.S. citizens are unemployed. The last time Apple was this high was on the back of Apple Intelligence hype, then it sank when it became apparent it was vaporware (for now) AI is here to stay just like the Internet. There may be a dot AI bust because of the froth. Every technology takes away one kind of employment and generates the other kind just like the Internet. The AI gene is out of the bottle, you cannot bottle it in whether you like it or not, remember Netscape and Bill Gates memo to his employees about changing the direction of his ‘ship.’ A big company like Apple can not ignore strong megatrends in technology just by saying , ‘human intelligence’ is better than ‘machine intelligence.’ Your email address will not be published.

Title: Why AMD and IBM Shares Just Took Quantum Leaps to Record Highs?

AMD and IBM took quantum leaps on Friday. Shares in the two companies jumped to record highs after Reuters reported that International Business Machines (IBM) has found that it could run a key quantum computing error-correcting algorithm on an easy-to-get and reasonably priced chip made by Advanced Micro Devices. Reuters said that a research paper to be released by IBM Monday shows that it can run those algorithms in real time on a kind of chip—called a field programmable gate array semiconductor— manufactured by AMD. AMD shares, which have more than doubled since the start of the year, were up nearly 7% in mid-afternoon trading Friday. IBM stock surged more than 7%, taking its year-to-date gain to about 40%, making it the second-biggest gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2025. Shares of Micron (MU), which makes memory solutions for AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) chips, rose 5% on Friday. For IBM, this breakthrough is progress toward making quantum computers more commercially viable and reliable. For AMD, it shows how affordable, flexible chips are becoming essential in advanced research—and extends the chip maker’s reach in next-generation computing. Jay Gambetta, director of IBM research, said in an interview that "Implementing it, and showing that the implementation is actually 10 times faster than what is needed, is a big deal," according to Reuters. Quantum computers use qubits to solve problems thousands of times faster than conventional computers, Reuters said. However, qubits are prone to making errors that overwhelm quantum chips, and tech companies have been racing to solve the problem. IBM plans to build a quantum computer named Starling by 2029, and Gambetta told Reuters the algorithm work was completed a year earlier than expected.

Title: Neocloud Crusoe Scores Funding, Oracle Debt Offering, CoreWeave Deal Drama

BREAKING: Stocks Rumble Higher As PayPal, UnitedHealth Rally Crusoe, a cloud infrastructure partner of ChatGPT builder OpenAI, raised $1.38 billion in a funding round that values the company at more than $10 billion. Crusoe is among a wave of artificial intelligence "neoclouds" that includes CoreWeave (CRWV), Nebius (NBIS), Lambda and Nscale. CoreWeave stock has climbed 225% since the company's initial public offering. Technology investors Valor Equity Partners and Mubadala Capital co-led the Crusoe funding round. Crusoe is a partner in the OpenAI project called Stargate in West Texas. Stargate is a joint venture of OpenAI, Oracle (ORCL), SoftBank and MGX. Crusoe also is building an AI data center in Wyoming. A group of banks next week will launch a massive $38 billion debt offering to help fund the build-out of various Oracle AI data centers, according to a Bloomberg report. Neoclouds build data centers designed from scratch for crunching AI workloads. Like CoreWeave, Crusoe rents out servers equipped with Nvidia (NVDA) AI accelerators. Lambda is also exploring an IPO, according to reports. On the stock market today, CoreWeave stock rose 6.5% to 131.46 in midday trading. CoreWeave's proposed all-stock acquisition of Core Scientific (CORZ), originally valued at $9 billion, continues to run into turbulence. Some shareholders oppose the deal and are seeking a higher premium. But CoreWeave has stated it does not plan to raise its offer. CoreWeave's stellar customer list also includes Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META). The IBD Methodology: How To Invest In Stocks While Managing Risks While some analysts project a big AI market opportunity for CoreWeave and other neoclouds, others fret about customer concentration and high debt. According to Synergy Reseach, neoclouds will garner of $23 billion in revenue combined in 2025 and will grow 69% annually through 2030. Economists are debating whether massive AI investment could harm other parts of the U.S. economy. While neoclouds and Oracle are adding debt, Meta has created a joint venture with Blue Owl Capital, a private asset manager, to fund its AI data center build-out. Meanwhile, CoreWeave stock owns a Composite Rating of 61 out of a best possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. Also, CoreWeave stock has a relatively small float, making it more volatile. The Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. Further, CoreWeave stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-plus. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. (A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.) Additionally, CoreWeave is among the top AI stocks to watch.

Title: Watch These Intel Stock Price Levels After Chipmaker's Earnings Blow Past Expectations
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-intel-stock-price-levels-after-chipmaker-earnings-blow-past-expectations-11836311
Time Published: 2025-10-24T15:20:53Z
Full Content:
Intel (INTC) shares rose Friday morning after the chipmaker swung to a profit that sailed past Wall Street expectations, signaling its closely watched turnaround plan is gaining traction. CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm in March and has refocused the company’s strategic direction, said the third-quarter results show Intel's "steady progress" in its turnaround, adding that demand for AI has created "attractive opportunities" across its portfolio. The stock was up 1.2% at $38.60 in recent trading, after surging above $41 early in the session to its highest level since April 2024. Coming into today's session, the stock had risen 90% so far this year, with the lion’s share of those gains coming in recent months as investors cheered multi-billion dollar investments from Nvidia (NVDA) and SoftBank (SFTBY), as well as the U.S. government’s 10% stake in the chipmaker. Below we analyze the technicals on Intel’s chart and identify important post-earnings price levels worth watching out for after the quarterly report. Intel shares have consolidated in a rectangle formation throughout most of October, setting the stage for a continuation of the stock’s recent uptrend. The trend for the stock has remained bullish since it broke out from a multi-month trading range in September, shortly after the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed above the 200-day MA to form a golden cross, a chart pattern that signals a sustained upward trend. Let’s apply technical analysis to project a potential near-term bullish target on Intel’s chart and also identify important support levels worth watching during future retracements. Investors can project an upside target on Intel’s chart by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis, we calculate the distance of the strong move higher that preceded the rectangle in points and add that amount to the formation's top trendline. For example, we add $10 to $39, which projects a target of $49. During pullbacks in the stock, investors should initially watch the $36 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the base of the rectangle formation and a cluster of prices situated just below the July 2024 swing high. A close below this level could see the shares retreat to around $32. Investors may look for buying opportunities in this area near the high of last month’s breakaway gap and a sideways trend that formed on the chart between April and July last year. Finally, selling below this level opens the door for a retest of a lower trading floor near $29. Intel shares may find support in this location around the late September low, which also closely aligns with the Aug. 1, 2024 closing price that preceded the stock’s significant gap lower the following day.

Title: This 7.7% Dividend Is The Last Cheap AI Stock

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. If I can give you one piece of advice now, it’s this: Don’t fear this talk of an AI bubble. In fact, we should love it, because it’s set to hand us a shot at big dividends and gains—especially in closed-end funds (CEFs), which yield around 8% today and regularly hand us “dividend deals” that simply shouldn’t exist. Our job: Buy, then ride along as CEF investors, who tend to be slowpokes compared to stock buyers, finally come around and bid our funds’ prices up. And we collect those rich dividends—often paid monthly—while we wait. One CEF is giving us just such a nonsensical discount today: a 7.7%-payer called the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO). This one holds many key AI players, including Meta Platforms (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as some companies that stand to gain as they work AI into their daily operations, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C). With most of these stocks skyrocketing, AIO should be pricey (“artificial intelligence” is right in the name, after all!). But it’s ridiculously cheap, trading at a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the AI stocks it owns). And any selloff in AI stocks would make it even cheaper. Which leads us back to the question on everyone’s mind: Are we in an AI-driven bubble? That’s critical to a buy of AIO now, so let’s dive in. We’ll start with an often-overlooked measure of where people’s heads are: a chart of common Google searches, in this case for the term “stock market bubble.” You can see at the right side of this chart that the term has been gaining since hitting a low in September 2024. It’s now at its highest point in almost five years. Why the bubble fears? Well, if you’ve been investing for a long time, your experience likely includes the popping of two major bubbles: the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and real estate in 2008. A couple generations were traumatized by those events, and as a result, we’re now in a kind of “bubble” of bubble talk. But are we really in an AI bubble? I’d say no. To start, let’s present the bubble case at its most dire: A Harvard academic recently suggested that, without AI investment, America’s GDP growth would’ve been a meager 0.1% in the first half of 2025. There are a lot of problems with this argument. For one, it ignores the fact that a lot of AI investment is imported from abroad (Bloomberg estimates that imports account for about half of all AI investment), and GDP only measures productivity inside a country. Bloomberg estimates that America’s 1.6% growth in the first half of 2025 would probably be more like 1.1% without AI investment. So, to be sure, AI is contributing much, but not most, of the country’s GDP growth, let alone all of it. Anyone trying to convince you otherwise is simply fear-mongering. Don’t take the bait—especially when other indicators point to a stable economy: This chart, for example, tells us that over the last year, Americans have been less delinquent on their credit cards than they were a year ago, and the overall percentage is pretty small—now about 3.1%, much lower than it was in the 1990s and 2000s. But let’s keep the focus on AI for a moment longer, because it sets up just how out of step that discount on our 7.7%-paying AI fund, AIO, really is. This chart comes from a recent Yale study showing that the share of workers exposed to AI hasn’t changed since the tech was released. “If AI were automating jobs at scale, we would expect to see a smaller share of workers in some of the jobs that are most negatively impacted,” the authors wrote. Yet this chart shows no change at all. In other words, AI isn’t making Americans poorer. It isn’t taking their jobs, and it isn’t a bubble set to burst. That doesn’t mean it won’t turn into any of those things—but it is none of them now. And that sets us up for a tempting trade. If AI starts taking jobs or making Americans feel more uncertain, we should expect a stock pullback that would hit all sectors, including AI names like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta and, of course, NVIDIA. If AI doesn’t take jobs because the tech doesn’t wind up meeting expectations, AI investment will drop and, again, take down names like Google, Meta and NVIDIA. Of course, everyone is watching these companies’ stocks like hawks, eager to sell at any sign of trouble. And that’s why, if we see a selloff driven by fear that any of the above-mentioned things will happen without data backing that up, they’ll be great buys. That’s where AIO comes back into the picture. It’s a diversified play on AI that rewards investors with that healthy 7.7% dividend, which comes our way monthly. It’s also a fund we know well at my CEF Insider service: We bought it in September 2020—long before AI was on investors’ radar—and rode it to a nice 23% total return (including its 6.4% dividend at the time we bought) in the following three years. And, as I mentioned before, AIO is cheap today. In fact, it’s cheaper than it was during the April “tariff terror, ” if you can believe it. That’s a setup that makes no sense at all! Yet here it is: We saw last spring’s deep discount flip to a premium by June. Now that premium has disappeared again, and AIO is back in bargain-bin territory. That doesn’t mean it’s worth buying now—but it does mean AIO is more sensitive to sentiment than the AI stocks it invests in. If investors sell off AI stocks, they’ll sell off AIO aggressively, opening up an even bigger discount and boosting its yield (since prices move in opposition to yields). That will be the time to pounce. Meantime, we’ll keep watching AIO and waiting for that bigger dividend, and discount, to materialize, thanks to the crowd’s overwrought bubble fears.

Intel could face heightened expectations from investors when it reports third-quarter earnings after the bell, following a torrid rally in recent months on a flurry of high-profile deals. Though the stock was little changed in early trading Thursday, it's up over 80% for 2025, with most of the gains coming since August when the federal government took a 10% stake in the struggling chipmaker. A partnership with rival Nvidia (NVDA) followed last month, adding to optimism around the stock and fueling speculation more deals could be on the way. However, the stock's rapid rise has also stoked some worries it may have climbed too far, too fast, with pressure now on Intel (INTC) to defend its support with evidence it's making progress toward a turnaround. That could set the stage for heightened volatility in the stock, with recent options pricing suggesting traders expect it could swing up to 10% in either direction after the results. There are some concerns on Wall Street that the recent enthusiasm for Intel's stock could be premature. Investors will likely be looking for signs in Thursday's report that the chipmaker is making good on its newfound support. Wall Street analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect the chipmaker to swing to a slight profit of 2 cents per share, from a loss in the preceding and year-ago quarters. Its revenue is projected to come in at $13.17 billion, which would represent a less than 1% decline from a year earlier. However, most analysts aren't convinced Intel's stock is a "buy" yet, with those surveyed by Visible Alpha largely maintaining neutral ratings while waiting to see more customer commitments to Intel's manufacturing business. Reports last week suggested Intel may have secured a major new AI customer; Microsoft (MSFT) was floated as a likely name. Announcing a new client along with the earnings could help win over analysts.
