Title: Wall Street Loves Broadcom, Nvidia and CoreWeave

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 After testing all-time highs, the major indices are in the red this morning. Dow futures are down 301 points. Nasdaq futures are down 344, as the S&P 500 sinks about 70 points. All thanks to a decline in Palantir’s overvalued shares, despite the company beating earnings estimates and offering solid guidance. There are also concerns about the stretched valuations of other key AI stocks and their ability to boost profits to justify numbers. Still, analysts are out with new upgrades. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO): Analysts at Jefferies reiterated a buy rating on AVGO and named it as a top pick. The firm also raised its price target to $480 from $415. As noted by the analysts, “While NVDA remains the leader and we still see upside there, AVGO has a greater magnitude of estimate upside as Google, Meta, and OAI ASICs ramp,” as quoted by CNBC. “Google has long been the main ASIC customer for AVGO, but those volumes should become much more meaningful in C26/27.” Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): Loop Capital reiterated its buy rating on the tech giant and hiked its price target to $350 from $250. The firm believes NVDA can double its GPU shipments over the next year to 15 months to 2.1 million by the January 2026 quarter. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on NVDA with a price target of $240 from $210 ahead of earnings, as well. The firm believes investor expectations have increased heading into NVDA earnings, thanks to multiple AI infrastructure announcements. The firm also believes NVDA will provide a beat and raise quarter. Helping, Nvidia is up on news that Microsoft secured export licenses from the Trump Administration to ship NVDA chips to the United Arab Emirates. CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV): Analysts at Citi reiterated a buy rating on CRWV ahead of earnings, with a price target of $192 from $164. The firm pointed to rising AI demand as a CRWV tailwind. “In the near term, we see CRWV as one of the larger AI beneficiaries across our coverage. With recent deals signed with NVDA, META, and an OpenAI expansion, we estimate ~85% QoQ backlog growth,” they said, as quoted by CNBC. “As Blackwell + customer ramps come online in 4Q, we expect a revenue reacceleration into year-end and outsized (~$100M+) revenue beats.” The image featured for this article is © LALAKA / Shutterstock.com Latest Podcast Episode OpenAI Signs Two Massive Deals and Two New Portfolio Buys 51 min See us invest in our favorite AI stock ideas for free Live Nov 4, 2025 Live Oct 30, 2025 The broad markets are mixed to kick off trading today.

A linkup with an artificial intelligence player helped power shares of a top cloud-computing services company higher Monday, while an acquisition in the consumer goods space sent the two stocks on divergent paths. Major U.S. equities indexes ended the first trading day of November mixed, kicking off a market week that will bring a wave of big-name quarterly reports. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, while the Nasdaq was up 0.5%. The Dow ended the session 0.5% lower. For more from Investopedia on the day's major market news, click here. IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX) shares jumped 15%, the best performance on the S&P 500 today, after the pet health specialist reported better-than-expected third quarter sales and profit. The company raised its 2025 revenue and earnings per share guidance, highlighting global customer adoption of its new diagnostic tools, which IDEXX says can help veterinarian teams increase clinical insights and streamline their workflows. Paper products giant Kimberly-Clark (KMB) said it would buy Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine parent company Kenvue (KVUE) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at around $49 billion. Kenvue, which completed a spin-off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, has been navigating litigation over allegations that its talcum powder causes cancer and statements from the Trump administration linking Tylenol to autism. Kenvue shares rose more than 12% Monday following the announcement of the deal, which came at a significant premium to Friday's closing price for Kenvue stock, while Kimberly-Clark shares plunged more than 14%. The latter company's shares were the worst performers on the S&P 500 today. Amazon (AMZN) shares jumped 5% after ChatGPT owner OpenAI signed an agreement to buy more than $38 billion worth of capacity its Amazon Web Services cloud unit. OpenAI said the deal to use AWS infrastructure would provide it with access to a significant number of Nvidia (NVDA) graphics processing units that could be employed to train its AI models. Nvidia shares gained 2.2%. Moderna (MRNA) stock sank 8.3% Monday, reversing a portion of the gains posted last week amid reports that the vaccine maker had held strategic talks with a major pharmaceutical company about a potential partnership or sale. Waning enthusiasm around a possible deal and concerns about the company's financial situation overshadowed Moderna's announcement that it administered the first dose in an early stage study of its experimental multiple myeloma therapy. KeyBanc downgraded Charter Communications (CHTR) stock to "sector weight" from "overweight" after the cable and internet provider reported lower-than-expected third-quarter sales and profit in its most-recent quarterly release. Analysts cited competitive headwinds to Charter's broadband subscriber growth, which can affect its free cash flow. Its stock fell about 5%.

IREN (IREN) shares jumped to an all-time high Monday after the Australian Bitcoin miner and data center company said it inked a $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft (MSFT). Shares of IREN were up over 8% near $66 in recent trading after reaching an intraday high of $75.73 earlier in the session. Shares of Microsoft were little changed. The company said the deal would give Microsoft access to Nvidia (NVDA) chips in its data centers over five years. IREN also said it struck a deal to purchase related Nvidia chips and ancillary equipment from Dell Technologies (DELL) for about $5.8 billion. IREN said it plans to pay for all the capital expenditures involved by “a combination of existing cash, customer prepayments, operating cashflows and additional financing initiatives.” IREN, like some other Bitcoin miners, has pivoted to focus more of its business on providing AI infrastructure to capitalize on the boom in demand for computing. Co-founder and CEO Daniel Roberts said that the Microsoft agreement represents “another major step forward for IREN as we continue to expand large-scale GPU deployments across our 3GW secured power portfolio in North America.” With Monday's gains, IREN shares are up close to 600% for 2025.

Stock futures are pointing higher to start the week as investors look ahead to another slew of earnings reports; OPEC+ agreed to pause output hikes; China said it would suspend additional rare earth curbs; Kimberly-Clark announced plans to buy Tylenol maker Kenvue; and Berkshire Hathaway's latest quarterly report showed its cash pile climbed to a record high. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are on the rise early Monday as investors prepare for a slew of earnings reports due from major technology and pharmaceutical companies this week, including an update from AI investor favorite Palantir (PLTR) after the closing bell today. The three major U.S. stock indexes come into today's session after ending October on a high note. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1% recently, while those linked to the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Bitcoin was trading below $108,000. Gold futures were slightly higher, at around $4,019 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slid to around 4.08%. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies on Sunday agreed to pause output hikes in the first quarter of 2026 after an increase due in December. The group of oil-producing nations has boosted its output targets since April, but began slowing the pace since October amid worries about a glut of supply. Crude oil futures climbed, then reversed course in early trading. China has agreed to suspend implementing additional rare earth export restrictions, as well as end investigations targeting American companies in the semiconductor supply chain, as part of the trade truce struck by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, The White House announced over the weekend. China also said it would consider easing export restrictions on semiconductors made by chip firm Nexperia. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and other semiconductor firms are higher in premarket trading. Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A, BRK.B) cash stockpile hit yet another high, according to the conglomerate's quarterly update over the weekend. The buildup has fueled speculation that Warren Buffett could be concerned about the market overheating after a series of recent record highs, waiting for better opportunities, or deferring the company's allocation to his successor as he prepares to step down from his role as CEO at the end of the year. Kimberly-Clark (KMB), the maker of Huggies diapers and other consumer brands, agreed to buy Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $48.7 billion. Kenvue faces a leadership shakeup and growing litigation concerns as the Trump administration has sought to draw links between its Tylenol and autism. Shares of Kenvue are soaring over 20% pre-market, while Kimberly-Clark's shares are down close to 15%.

Title: China tweets satellite photos of Taiwan's critical Hsinchu chip hub in pressure-ratcheting political stunt — 'where all the world’s advanced foundry IP is created,' highest concentration of chipmaking facilities in the world

A Chinese embassy post highlighting Hsinchu Science Park underscores rising geopolitical risks to the world’s most advanced chip supply. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. On Friday night, China’s embassy in Washington posted a familiar message to X: “There is but one China in the world.” But this time, the predictable rhetoric from China came with a glossy photo carousel that included a sweeping aerial shot of Hsinchu Science Park, the epicenter of the world’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturing. As analyst Patrick Moorhead highlighted in a response to the embassy’s post, Hsinchu includes TSMC’s Fabs 12A, 12B, 20, 3, 5, 8, 2 and the Advanced Backend Fab 1, all crammed into the park’s core, along with the company’s Global R&D Center, “where all the world’s advanced foundry IP is created,” he wrote, pointing out that chips for Nvidia, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, and even Intel depends on this small square of land. There is but one #China in the world; #Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. Every inch of Taiwan Province, China, is vibrant under the "Jilin-1" space satellite's perspective. 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳💧Sun Moon Lake 日月潭⛰Alishan 阿里山🏙Taipei City 台北市⚓️Taipei Port 台北港… pic.twitter.com/bOIvAdrSuyOctober 31, 2025 While the post didn’t mention chips directly, it didn’t have to. Hsinchu is home to TSMC’s original fabs, the headquarters of MediaTek and UMC, and key government agencies that oversee Taiwan’s space and chip strategy. There is no other place on Earth with the same concentration of cutting-edge logic process nodes. This is where the GPUs that train AI models begin, where desktop and server CPUs are etched, and where bleeding-edge silicon IP is designed. Expand the embedded tweet below to see the images. Let me be clearer. Here are the TSMC fabs currently in Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan: Fab 12A/12B/20/3/5/8/2 and Advanced Backend Fab 1. Oh, and $TSM HQ and the “Global R&D Center” where all the world’s advanced foundry IP is created to build all $NVDA, $AMD, $AVGO, $AAPL,… https://t.co/zpCTETPHKf pic.twitter.com/d0KiK19iYWNovember 1, 2025 This isn’t the first time that Beijing has tried to remind the world of Taiwan’s vulnerability. In recent months, Chinese naval forces have staged simulated blockades in the Taiwan Strait, inspecting commercial cargo ships and raising fears of a chokepoint disruption. The Trans-Pacific Express Cable System, which directly connects Taiwan to the U.S. East Coast, Japan, South Korea, and China, was damaged by a Cameroon-flagged freighter, Shunxing39, earlier this year, prompting Taiwan to increase legal penalties for damaging undersea cables. According to a recent special report from Reuters, U.S. officials have begun modeling worst-case scenarios for the Bashi Channel, a key shipping lane essential to Taiwanese exports like advanced wafers and electronics, in response to recent incursions. In September, the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called Taiwan’s chip sector the “single greatest point of failure for the world economy” because 99% of high-performance chips are manufactured there, and back in June 2021, a White House review warned that even a temporary hit to TSMC output could ripple through everything from datacenters to defense. China’s embassy didn’t need to mention any of that directly. A single photo of Hsinchu was enough at a moment while tensions remain high.

Title: S&P 500 Q3 2025 Earnings Surge: Magnificent 7 Lead Market Rally
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/11/02/sp-500-q3-2025-earnings-surge-magnificent-7-lead-market-rally/
Time Published: 2025-11-02T12:24:46Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its second busiest week, with 135 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Palantir (PLTR), Pfizer (PFE), Yum! Brands (YUM), Emerson Electric (EMR), McDonald’s (MCD), Humana (HUM), and Qualcomm (QCOM). Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported better-than-expected earnings on Saturday. A deeper dive and insights into Berkshire Hathaway’s third-quarter earnings are here. With 64% of companies reporting so far, 83% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 10.7% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rates for calendar years 2025 and 2026 increased to 11.2% and 14.0%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remained the group to watch this earnings season. Despite the disappointments from Tesla (TSLA) and Meta Platforms (META), the rest of the group picked up the slack. Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon.com (AMZN) continued to support the thesis that demand for artificial intelligence (AI) is driving robust growth. Meta Platforms (META) posted disappointing headline earnings due to a non-cash tax charge. More importantly, investors were spooked by the announcement of more than $100 billion in planned investments in AI next year. As a positive, third-quarter revenues grew 26% year over year, and their ad business continues to post impressive results, so the underlying business remains robust. NVIDIA (NVDA), the last of the Magnificent 7 to report earnings, is scheduled to report on November 19. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the information technology, consumer discretionary, and health care sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. As detailed above, the communication services sector was the largest detractor due to Meta’s earnings miss. Within technology, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) were the most significant positive drivers. Amazon.com (AMZN) was the most crucial positive surprise in consumer discretionary, while Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) were the most notable positive surprises in health care. Sales growth at 7.9% is running well above expectations. Three sectors are on pace for double-digit year-over-year sales growth this quarter: information technology, communication services, and health care. With the government shutdown continuing to drag on, US economic releases should remain relatively sparse. Importantly, the widely watched monthly jobs report is likely to be delayed by the government closure. Instead, the private ADP employment change release on Wednesday and the Challenger job-cut announcement report on Thursday will attract more attention than usual as investors and economists gauge the softness of the US labor market. Third-quarter earnings reports will fill the void during the second busiest reporting week of the season. While a better-than-expected earnings season is all but assured, the individual company reports and any commentary about future earnings expectations remain crucial. As widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut at its meeting last Wednesday. Fed Chair Powell pushed back harder than expected against the market expectations of another cut at the December meeting, sending the odds to a little less than a 2-in-3 chance. The calendar is chock-full of Fed members speaking this week, so their comments will be closely monitored to gauge better the likelihood of a Fed easing in December.

Earnings season kicked into high gear last week when five of the Magnificent Seven members with a combined market value of over $15 trillion reported results. The tech titans—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—reported better-than-expected results across the board, and forecast their massive investments in artificial intelligence will grow in the coming year. Below, we take a closer look at some of the key takeaways from this round of big tech earnings. These tech giants account for a sizable share of the U.S. stock market, making their quarterly earnings some of the most highly anticipated and consequential events on Wall Street. Their investments in artificial intelligence have also been a boon to the U.S. economy over the last year. One thing made clear in last week's earnings calls, was that the hyperscalers’ AI investments are showing no signs of a pullback. Amazon on Thursday raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast and said that investments will increase next year. Alphabet also bumped up its capex guidance for the third time this year and forecast another “significant” increase next year. Microsoft didn’t share a quarterly or full-year capex estimate, but CFO Amy Hood said investments will grow even faster in fiscal year 2026 than in 2025. Executives stressed that, despite their massive investments up to this point, they expect demand will continue to outstrip supply into next year. Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, Azure, likely bore the brunt of its capacity constraints, according to Hood, who said the company has been forced to prioritize other core business offerings. She, like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also said that their internal AI teams need more computing capacity. Citi analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect cloud data center capex to grow 24% in 2026, which should be a boon to semiconductor makers like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Spending on data centers is all well and good with Wall Street, as long as investors perceive rising profits will make it worthwhile. Meta shares tanked on Thursday after the company posted earnings that missed estimates due to a one-time tax charge, and raised the low end of its full-year capex guidance. Meta also said it expects its capex growth will accelerate next year. "The real focus coming out of earnings is Meta's updated view on 2026 capex and expenses as the company looks to build out an industry-leading amount of compute," JPMorgan analysts told clients in a note Thursday. "The costs for Meta are outsized relative to Google and Amazon, as those companies are larger and both have cloud businesses that provide an immediate path to Gen AI monetization, unlike for Meta,” they said. Higher operating costs added to Wall Street’s concerns about Meta’s AI spending. Total expenses rose 32% year-over-year in the third quarter, compared to 12% in the previous quarter, and are expected to grow even faster next year. Employee compensation was one of the largest contributors to rising expenses. Meta went on an AI hiring spree this year, making headlines for poaching top talent with eye-watering pay packages. That's added more pressure on Meta to find ways to cut costs. Recent reports of layoffs, including in its AI division, could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to keep its spending in check. In the first inning of the AI craze on Wall Street, Alphabet was often looked at as a laggard in the space. Its Bard chatbot flubbed its first public demonstration, and analysts worried that the rising popularity of chatbots from startups like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, could spell major disruption for Google’s core search business. However, Alphabet's strong quarterly results—thanks in part to AI search features—would counter that narrative. According to executives, Google’s AI search features, AI Overviews and AI Mode, are helping to increase search query volume, the opposite of what Wall Street expected. Google’s search revenue growth has accelerated throughout the year, rising from 10% to 12% in the second quarter, and then to 15% in the third. Executives added that Google is monetizing AI search queries at about the same rate as traditional search. “Search acceleration (paid clicks up 7% vs 4% in 2Q) despite OpenAI's strong usage growth suggests AI is expanding the overall ‘information’ opportunity, driving higher query volume and improving monetization,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Thursday. Some investors have become concerned in recent months that the AI boom is being fueled by a handful of companies striking very large deals. For example, OpenAI accounted for nearly all of Oracle’s (ORCL) massive cloud computing backlog in the most recent quarter, and Nvidia said in its most recent earnings report that two direct customers accounted for almost 40% of its quarterly sales. But Microsoft executives sought to soothe worries about concentration risks during Wednesday’s earnings call. When asked about the breadth of contracts contributing to Microsoft’s record backlog, which grew 51% to $392 billion, CFO Amy Hood said, “it covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes." CEO Satya Nadella also suggested he sees broadening demand related to AI over time, telling analysts, “concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base.” The wider enterprise adoption cycle, he said, "is just starting."
