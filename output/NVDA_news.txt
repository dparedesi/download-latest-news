Update font size. Reset Apple briefly reached a $4 trillion market value in early trading on Tuesday, becoming the third Big Tech giant to hit this milestone. Strong demand for its latest iPhone models eased concerns about the company’s lagging AI progress, which critics attribute to a lack of visionary leadership. Reuters: ‎ Apple’s shares have gained about 13% since the new launches on September 9, in a remarkable turnaround that pushed the stock into positive territory for the first time this year. Brokerage Evercore ISI expects the strong demand for Apple’s latest iPhones to help it surpass market expectations for the three-month period ending in September and issue upbeat forecasts for the quarter ending in December. Apple is the third company to hit the $4 trillion mark after Nvidia and Microsoft. Nvidia currently tops the table with a market value of more than $4.5 trillion. Apple’s cautious approach to AI had fueled concerns it could lose out on what could be the industry’s biggest growth catalyst in decades. Recent reports also indicate that the company is losing a number of its senior artificial intelligence executives to Meta. The company was slow to roll out its Apple Intelligence suite, including a ChatGPT integration, while an AI upgrade to its voice assistant Siri has been delayed until next year. ‎ MacDailyNews Note: Apple’s market cap has fallen back under $4 trillion in subsequent trading.

Title: Nvidia Will Fall Apart, According to This Analyst

Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 A recent analysis shows that only one Wall Street analyst rates Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) as a Sell. Bloomberg reports that 73 analysts have a Buy rating on the stock and another six rate it Hold. This optimism is astonishing for a stock that is up 1,426% in the past five years. The news service reports that the Nvidia bear, Jay Goldberg, a senior analyst at Seaport Global Securities, believes “There’s a lot more that can go wrong with Nvidia than can go right.” His belief is based on the fact that Nvidia has a small number of huge customers that make up much of its revenue. These include Microsoft and Amazon, which say they will spend tens of billions of dollars on artificial intelligence this year. That primarily includes the cost of infrastructure, which includes electricity, and the cost of Nvidia chips. solarseven / iStock via Getty Images Goldberg’s view of the future has legs. Consider what has become known as “round-tripping” of cash. Nvidia invests in a company and then gets much of that investment back in chip sales. For example, Nvidia’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI, the industry leader. Some of that money is “recycled” to Nvidia in chip sales, AKA revenue. One decision of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could stop this questionable practice. Nvidia’s top line could take a massive hit. Another argument is that AI will never be a huge commercial success. The greatest technology advance in history may produce little money. Most AI users today rely on free versions. For AI to be considered a success, companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon must make hundreds of billions of dollars on enterprise applications. It is much too early in AI’s evolution to say whether that will happen. Next, Nvidia has competition, although its bulls think those rivals will always be small. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) leads these competitors. Its stock is up 119% this year. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) recently announced an AI chip, and its stock rose 20% in a day. For Nvidia to keep its valuation, it must stay well ahead of these companies in revenue. Finally, there is the Chinese market. By most estimates, it is the only country close to the United States in AI development. China has blocked Nvidia chip sales, saying it has its own advanced chips, which can be improved. If Nvidia stays locked out of the market, it loses out on potentially huge sales. If Chinese chips become truly competitive, they could be direct competition to Nvidia beyond China and the U.S. Goldberg has a case.

Title: Invest $100K In These Funds, Beat Inflation For A Lifetime
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/10/28/invest-100k-in-these-funds-beat-inflation-for-a-lifetime/

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I hate to see investors (particularly retirees) starving for dividends, especially with inflation stuck around 3% (and you and I both know that the real number is higher—just head down to your local grocery store!). A big myth around dividends is that you have to invest a lot upfront to get anything meaningful in return. It’s easy to see why people feel that way, with the average S&P 500 stock paying a meager 1.1% as I write this. This is where my favorite investments, closed-end funds (CEFs), come in. Using the three we’ll delve into below, you could get a little over $1,000 a month in income, thanks to their double-digit yields. What’s more, this three-fund portfolio mixes stocks and bonds to get us some nice diversification (and the downside protection that comes with it). Let’s start with bonds. The KKR Income Opportunities Fund (KIO) holds over 300 bonds and other loans issued by the likes of JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL), chemical maker Chemours Co. (CC), Virgin Media and consulting firm Kroll. KIO takes the interest it collects and flips it to investors in the form of that hefty 12.4% dividend. Moreover, nearly all of its bonds are below-investment grade. That’s more of an opportunity than a risk, because that’s where the highest yields, and best bargains, are. Moreover, KIO has been around for over a decade and—despite rising interest rates, a pandemic and other turmoil—has steadily increased its net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) in that time. All of that suggests KIO can keep delivering its high yield. Moreover, it has a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio), so there’s gain potential if that discount shrinks, or flips to a premium, as it did just last year. In other words, you can pick up KIO, wait for its discount to shrink, then sell at a profit. And you get to collect that sweet dividend in the meantime. Now let’s add stocks through the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA), a CEF holding well-known firms like AI stars NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Even so, this fund is nicely diversified, and management has smartly bought and sold its holdings to drive a big jump in its portfolio, or NAV, since the April selloff. This return is more than enough to cover the fund’s dividend, which yields 11.3% annualized. That return should be rewarded with a premium valuation, yet USA not only trades at a discount, but its discount has widened, creating a rare buying opportunity. USA hasn’t been this cheap since the pandemic! When investors see that they can get NVIDIA, Microsoft and more at a near-10% markdown, expect them to drive this fund’s price up. Buy now and you can get the fund’s huge dividend while you wait. (Though we should note that the fund’s dividend does “float” a bit—which is a good thing: It gives management the opportunity to pick up bargains in a selloff, potentially boosting our long-term gains.) With stocks and bonds together, and an average 11.9% yield between our first two funds, we already have a great portfolio that can withstand years of market volatility. But we’re not done yet. Let’s wrap by adding energy stocks through the NXG Cushing Midstream Energy Fund (SRV). Its 12.8% yield is the biggest of our trio, but its pricing chart is different. With a 2.5% premium, SRV is priced right around where its portfolio’s true value lies. And note how the fund’s market pricing has been rangebound in the last couple years, hovering around par. That’s after SRV traded at an absurd post-pandemic discount, when energy demand wasn’t rising quickly, while at the same time, technology was making energy production easier, causing a surplus. Now, with AI, the story is different: Technology is driving energy demand higher, far beyond the degree to which it’s making energy production easier. Those power prices are likely to stick around, which is why SRV has been priced higher of late. This makes SRV a great fund for shorter-term action; collect the 12.8% dividend, sure, but be prepared to sell if the fund’s premium rises much beyond 5%. Then you can use your returns to buy USA, KIO or another oversold CEF. Then, when that fund gets overbought, sell it at a profit after collecting your dividends and use that to buy another high-yielding CEF. That’s the beauty of CEFs, and in particular CEFs’ discounts to NAV, which tell us exactly when a fund has reached a peak valuation. And then, of course, there are the dividends: As mentioned, the three-fund mini-portfolio we just discussed starts you off with over $1,000 per month in income for every $100K you invest. But over time, you can expect your portfolio to grow—and its income potential to keep rising as it does. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: The Reason Caterpillar's Stock Is 'Priced for Perfection'—And Beating Nvidia in 2025

A company known for its distinctive yellow construction equipment and its iconic logo has become an AI darling. Yes, we mean Caterpillar (CAT)—which through Monday's close has the best-performing stock in the Dow, ahead of companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), thanks to an AI-driven metamorphosis. Caterpillar has lately seen stalling earnings growth in 2025, with its past two quarterly reports missing expectations. Still, its shares are up more than 45% year-to-date, more than the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLI) 18% gain, the S&P's 17%, and Nvidia's 38%. And when Caterpillar reports third-quarter earnings pre-market tomorrow morning, investors are likely to focus on a key driver of its future growth: data centers' surging demand for electricity. That trend is shifting the spotlight to Caterpillar's energy and transportation segment from its construction and resources segments, which have been challenged. The latter—bulldozers, excavators, and mining trucks—will "take a backseat" as the former—backup and primary power generation sets, solar turbines, and gas pipelines—drives earnings in the coming years, according to BofA Global Research analysts, who have a "buy" rating on the stock. The E&T segment accounts for roughly 40% of Caterpillar's sales, according to BofA. Businesses within the segment, including its power generation business, "continue to outgrow the overall business," Bank of America wrote in June. Last year, E&T chipped in about $29 billion of the company's roughly $65 billion in total sales, more than either of the construction and resources units. Caterpillar's stock has been a beneficiary of investor penchant for AI-themed investments. Its next earnings report, due Wednesday morning, will be the latest opportunity for investors to determine whether the company's data center power-play narrative can endure. Can the stock keep rising? Morgan Stanley analyst Angel Castillo recent said Caterpillar shares, sitting near all-time highs, were "priced for perfection." Wall Street analysts, on average, have a price target of about $497, 6% below Monday's close of $527. More evidence of an oversupplied construction market and the firm's cautious views on non-residential construction activity, Castillo said, will put pressure on its construction segment. Without strength in other segments to offset that weakness, he said, there's the risk of negative earnings revisions. Still, growth in E&T could be a potent mood booster. "Any amount of sequential growth is enough to keep sentiment positive," he wrote in a report last week. The firm has a bearish rating on the stock.

Title: Qualcomm Stock Is Soaring Today After Chipmaker Makes a Big AI Move

Qualcomm is joining the competition to supply chips for AI data centers. Qualcomm (QCOM), which has largely focused on chips for mobile phones, laptops and other consumer devices to date, on Monday unveiled two AI accelerator chips for data centers: the AI200, which is set for release in 2026, and the AI250, which is planned for 2027. Shares of Qualcomm were up more than 13% in recent trading, pacing gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. With Monday's gains, they've added about one-quarter of their value in 2025. Qualcomm's expansion into the market for data center chips comes as a growing number of companies look to capitalize on booming demand for AI with products catering to data centers. The share prices of many of those companies have surged, helping power the broader stock market to record highs. The move marks a big step for Qualcomm, which said that it will be committed to a data center roadmap with an annual cadence for major releases or updates going forward. It could also mean more competition for leading AI chipmakers such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with several analysts suggesting in recent weeks that they see Nvidia's dominant market share diminishing over time as competition and demand grows. Shares of Nvidia were up 2.5% in recent trading amid a broader market rally, while AMD shares were up slightly after hitting an all-time high at the open.

AMD stock is on a record-breaking streak. It’s trading around $253 after a 6.5% surge Friday, up nearly 90% this year—thanks to major AI partnerships that have Wall Street buzzing. A game-changing OpenAI chip deal on October 6 sparked a 34% single-day jump. Then came an Oracle GPU order and an IBM quantum breakthrough, lifting AMD shares another 7–8%. Now, analysts are racing to catch up. Bank of America lifted its target to $300, HSBC to $310, and others into the high $200s.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are pointing to a sharply higher open this morning after major indexes closed last week at record highs; investor sentiment is getting a boost after President Donald Trump said he was optimistic the U.S. would reach a trade deal with China and address ownership of social media app TikTok; Avidity Biosciences (RNA) shares are surging after Swiss pharmaceutical maker Novartis (NVS) said it would acquire the biotechnology firm; and U.S.-listed shares of Argentine companies are soaring after President Javier Milei’s political party posted victories in legislative elections there. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are higher this morning amid optimism about an apparent easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, while investors prepare for an expected rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a flurry of earnings reports from major technology companies later in the week. The three major U.S. stock indexes come into today's session at record highs after each gained about 2% last week following a mild inflation report that reaffirmed expectations that the Fed will cut its key rate on Wednesday. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.5% recently, while those linked to the the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively. Bitcoin was trading at $115,400, up from a low over the weekend around $111,000. Gold futures were down 2.6% at $4,030 an ounce, as the precious metal continues to step back from recent highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, rose to 4.02% from 4.00% at Friday's close. Crude oil futures were down slightly at around $61.40 after jumping last week following a move by the U.S. to place sanctions on Russian oil firms. President Donald Trump said early Monday that the U.S. is positioned to reach a trade deal with China, as the the president gets set to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea. "I have a lot of respect for President Xi, and we are going to come away with the deal,” Trump said. U.S. and Chinese negotiators over the weekend reached a framework for a trade deal that could result in a reduction of tariffs and trade barriers between the two countries. The deal will reportedly delay the implementation of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports that were slated to begin on Nov. 1, while China’s export controls on rare earth elements are also expected to be delayed as the two sides continue negotiations. Trump also expects the two countries to reach a deal on ownership of the social media app TikTok. The U.S. also announced that separate trade and mineral agreements were reached with Malaysia and Cambodia, while trade pact frameworks were struck with Thailand and Vietnam. Shares of U.S. chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which are seeking to sell into Chinese markets, were both up more than 2% in premarket trading. Trump said that the U.S. will slap an additional 10% tariff on Canadian goods after the Ontario provincial government ran an ad criticizing tariffs during the World Series on Friday. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that broadcasts of the ad would end on Monday. Trump has criticized the ad for featuring comments from former President Ronald Reagan, which he described as a “serious misrepresentation of the facts.” Trump had placed a tariff of 35% on Canadian goods not covered by the USMCA agreement, though tariffs on some products like steel and aluminum are subject to levies of 50%. Trump had previously said trade negotiations with Canada would be “terminated” over the ad. Shares of Avidity Biosciences (RNA) are soaring in premarket trading after Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis (NVS) agreed to buy the biotechnology company in a deal valued at $12 billion. Avidity will spin off part of its early-stage precision cardiology business before closing the deal in the first half of 2026, Novartis said in a statement. “The Avidity team has built robust programs with industry-leading delivery of RNA therapeutics to muscle tissue,” Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said. “We look forward to developing these programs to meaningfully change the trajectory of diseases for patients.” Shares of Avidity jumped more than 40% ahead of the opening bell, while Novartis shares were down about 1%. Shares of U.S.-listed Argentine companies are surging after President Javier Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party won a landslide legislative victory. President Donald Trump had offered to provide financial support for Argentina but said that the bailout hinged on the outcome of the election. "BIG WIN in Argentina for Javier Milei, a wonderful Trump Endorsed Candidate?," Trump said on Truth Social. Shares of financial services companies Grupo Financiero Galicia SA (GGAL), Banco BBVA Argentina SA (BBAR) and Banco Macro SA (BMA) each gained more than 30% in premarket trading. Shares of oil company YPF (YPF) jumped about 25%, while shares of e-commerce firm MercadoLibre (MELI) added 7%.

Wall Street is back in rally mode. The US stock market today is surging as investors cheer signs of a possible Trump-Xi trade deal. Dow futures are up 250 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both higher — and traders are betting on a major Fed rate cut this week. Markets are now turning their focus to Trump’s high-stakes Asia trip. He’s set to meet China’s President Xi on Thursday, and early talks hint at “a substantial framework” for an agreement, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Across Asia, stocks are exploding higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 smashed through 50,000 for the first time ever. Kospi, Hang Seng, and Shanghai Composite are all in the green.

Microsoft is slated to report quarterly results after markets close Wednesday, and Wall Street analysts expect another solid showing. “We view MSFT as the clear front-runner on the enterprise hyper-scale AI front despite increasing competition from Amazon/AWS and Google/GCP,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note last week. Analysts expect Microsoft to report adjusted earnings grew 11% to $3.68 per share in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Wall Street is looking for revenue from Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, to increase by about 38% to around $23 billion, while total revenue is expected to increase 15% to $75.5 billion. With its array of businesses spanning cloud computing, enterprise software and personal computing, Microsoft’s earnings can signal both the strength of AI demand and the health of the broader economy. As America’s third-most valuable company, Microsoft's stock has a greater impact than most on investors’ portfolios. Many analysts say anecdotal evidence points to an even stronger quarter than Wall Street is expecting. The feedback Deutsche Bank analysts have received from Microsoft customers “reflects an overwhelmingly positive consensus on Microsoft's fundamental and competitive standing,” they wrote in a note Thursday. Citi analysts also noted their conversations with Microsoft partners were resoundingly positive, with corporate and public customers indicating strong demand for Azure. Bank of America analysts are forecasting total first-quarter revenue of $77 billion, but expect as much as 1% upside to that estimate, “driven by workload migration to Azure, strength in security and applications.” Wedbush concurred, calling Microsoft's forecast of 37% Azure growth "relatively conservative." Microsoft is coming off a very strong earnings report in July, when it beat top- and bottom-line estimates and indicated cloud computing demand continued to outstrip supply. To meet that demand, the company estimated it would spend $30 billion on infrastructure in the most recent quarter. Microsoft’s infrastructure spending will be one of the most closely watched figures in this week’s results. Its spending on cloud and AI data centers has fueled exponential sales growth at chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). This week’s earnings from Microsoft and big tech peers Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) will give Wall Street insight into the strength of the quarter for Nvidia and other AI infrastructure suppliers. Bank of America analysts expect Microsoft’s full-year capital expenditures will total $125 billion, $10 billion more than the Wall Street consensus. “We are bullish on upward revisions to Microsoft's CapEx, which would likely be a catalyst for the stock,” the analysts wrote. Microsoft shares have treaded water since popping on last quarter’s earnings report. The stock is down about 2% since the end of July, while the Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 10%. BofA attributes the underperformance to a shift in “AI infrastructure momentum away from Microsoft (to Oracle),” which last quarter reported a massive jump in orders from Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Saying that infrastructure spending will exceed prior estimates could help Microsoft regain that momentum, according to BofA. Uncertainty about Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI has also been an overhang for the stock, according to Deutsche Bank. The two companies last month signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to extend their partnership, but much remains to be negotiated, including Microsoft’s access to OpenAI’s intellectual property and programming interfaces, as well as how ownership of OpenAI’s for-profit division will be structured. “How things may shake out across these key pillars is unclear, but we believe skeptics are underappreciating Microsoft's strong position to extract value here,” wrote Deutsche Bank’s Brad Zelnick and Bhavin Shah.

Meta has big AI goals, but can it convince investors to keep supporting its big spending? The company's progress with AI will be in focus when the social media giant reports third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching closely for signs its investments are paying off. Meta Platforms (META), which boosted its capital expenditures projections twice this year to support its data center buildouts and hefty compensation packages for poached AI talent, could now face a higher bar to impress with its results. Bank of America analysts said last week they're calling for a revenue beat of $50 billion driven by ad gains to support Meta's spending, slightly above the Street consensus compiled by Visible Alpha at $49.55 billion—which would represent a record high. Meanwhile, the mean estimate for Meta's earnings per share at $6.70 would suggest year-over-year growth, but a decline from the previous quarter. Recent reports of layoffs and hiring freezes could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to rein in costs. Meta has been more successful than many of its other big tech peers so far this year in convincing investors to support its AI goals. Wednesday's results could represent the next big test to show it's made the revenue gains to justify its spending. Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the social media giant's stock heading into the results, with all but one of the 21 analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha calling it a "buy" compared to just one "hold" rating. Their mean price target near $873 would suggest roughly 16% upside from Tuesday's close. The stock has added 28% of its value in 2025, making it one of the better-performing members of the Magnificent 7, behind Nvidia (NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). UPDATE—Oct. 29, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent price values and analyst estimates.

Title: S&P 500 Surges: Magnificent 7 Earnings, Rate Cut, And AI Boom Drive Q3

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its busiest week, which includes an earnings report from five of the Magnificent 7 and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). 173 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Boeing (BA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). With 29% of companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 9.2% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar years 2025 and 2026 is unchanged at 11.0% and 13.9%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. In addition, the better-than-expected consumer inflation reading opened the door to a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, which helped stocks, particularly banks. The lack of additional “cockroaches” last week helped regional banks snap back from concerns over reported loan fraud. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings were below expectations last week, and it was the only member of the Magnificent 7 that saw a stock price decline last week. Five of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week: Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the financials, information technology, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500’s earnings growth rate increase last week. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF) and Chubb (CB) were the most significant positive drivers. Intel (INTC) was the most crucial positive surprise in technology, while RTX (RTX) and GE Aerospace (GE) were the most notable positive surprises in industrials. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. However, sales growth at 7.0% is running well above expectations. So far this earnings season, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors have been the most critical drivers of improved sales growth. The government shutdown delayed September consumer inflation (CPI) readings, but the headline and core, excluding food and energy, were better than expected. The headline and core CPI were 3% year-over-year. The top-line numbers were more favorable than expected, despite concerns about price pressure from tariffs. In addition, the details were similarly comforting, with the pace of price gains for services and housing slowing. The 3-month annualized rate of CPI growth held steady, suggesting the recent inflation acceleration might be subsiding. With the government shutdown dragging on and delaying or withholding many US economic releases, the focus will be on the busiest week of the earnings season. In addition, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings. This group has an outsized impact on the S&P 500’s expected earnings growth rate. It is also an essential bellwether for gauging the health of the artificial intelligence boom and the technology sector as a whole. Despite the government shutdown, tariffs, and a cooling labor market, the economy continues to hold up well, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 4%. President Trump is scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi this week, and markets anticipate some thawing in tensions between the countries, though a full-scale trade deal is unlikely. The friendlier inflation data last week sealed the deal for another 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at their meeting on Wednesday. Financial markets expect another cut at the December meeting. Given the additional economic visibility issues arising from the government shutdown, management’s forward earnings guidance will be even more closely watched. Since the Fed rate cut is a virtual certainty, Chair Powell’s comments about the future path of monetary policy will be closely watched. He is unlikely to be forceful in his views, given the lack of visibility into the health of the labor market, but shouldn’t buck expectations for another Fed easing in December.
