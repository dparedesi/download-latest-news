Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The rocky week on Wall Street continued on Thursday as investors grappled with further uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. US stocks opened sharply lower but fluctuated on the mixed messaging coming from the White House. All three major indexes closed lower, despite Trump announcing a nearly one-month tariff delay on all products from Mexico and Canada that are covered by the USMCA free trade treaty. Earlier in the day, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the president would likely announce a one-month tariff delay on products that are covered by the USMCA. The Dow closed lower by 428 points, or 0.99%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.78% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.61%. The Nasdaq closed in correction territory, down 10% from its record high in December. That leaves the Dow down almost 3% on the week, on track for its worst week since March 2023. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both on pace for their worst week since September 2024. The market is in the red during Trump’s presidency in part because of the uncertainty the administration’s trade policy has caused. The Nasdaq has fallen more than 7% since Trump took office, and the S&P 500 is down more than 4%. Investor sentiment is struggling due to the persistent uncertainty around tariffs, according to Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. “Eventually, that uncertainty is just going to weigh too much on business decisions and those forward prospects for earnings growth,” Haworth said. Also in focus for investors: recent data revealing the extent of recent layoffs and renewed concerns about spending on artificial intelligence. Futures tied to the Dow had tumbled in early trading as new economic data showed unease in the labor market. US-based employers last month announced plans to slash 172,017 jobs, a 103% increase from January and the highest February total since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas’s latest monthly job cuts report. Related article US employers cut more jobs last month than any February since 2009 Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 also fell in early trading as companies focused on the AI trade posted mixed earnings results and guidance for this year. Marvell Technologies (MRVL), a chipmaker, fell by almost 20%. Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) also slid, dragging the Nasdaq lower. Chinese tech giant Alibaba on Thursday announced its own AI model, challenging upstart DeepSeek as well as OpenAI, raising questions about whether the AI boom in the US is worth the money that is being poured into it. Thursday’s decline is a reversal of the rally on Wednesday afternoon, highlighting that investors lack clarity and confidence about the next developments in the brewing trade war between the US and its biggest trading partners. “For now, tariff-induced inflation amid slower growth could bring the economy dangerously close to stagflation,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL financial, in a note Wednesday. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength relative to six other currencies, fell to its lowest level since November — signaling a weakening outlook for US economic growth. Investors will be closely attuned to the government’s monthly jobs report Friday, set to be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. ET. and giving investors more insight into how the economy is doing. “I think if we see the hard data start to come in much weaker, that’ll become more and more concerning for the market,” said Haworth. “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving investors for the past week, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.

Title: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) March-Quarter Revenue To Be Impacted By “Blackwell Queue” And NVIDIA’s Ongoing Preference For Hyperscalers, As Per The Insights Gleaned By An Analyst From A Fireside Chat

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), one of the most prominent retailers of data center servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, has been trapped in the market's purgatory ever since the stock cleared its biggest near-term overhang by filing its requisite financial statements with the SEC in the nick of time to avoid a damaging delisting event. Now, a Wall Street analyst has stepped up to provide some much-needed context to SMCI's confounding weakness. Super Micro Computer recently provided a fairly disappointing near-term guidance, but was able to limit the fallout by aggressively ramping up its projections for FY 2026. To wit, SMCI now expects to earn $40 billion in full-year revenue in FY 2026 vs. Wall Street's consensus estimate of just $29 billion. Now, Northland analyst Nehal Chokshi is out with an important investment note on Super Micro Computer's prospects. To wit, Chokshi hosted SMCI's IR team for a fireside chat on the 28th of February, after the company had filed its "delayed FY24 10K, F1Q25 10Q (Sept Q) and F2Q25 (Dec Q) 10Q on Tuesday, February 25th, NVDA reporting modest data center upside on Wednesday, February 26th and key peer DELL reporting results on Thursday, February 27th." Bear in mind that NVIDIA and CoreWeave are Super Micro Computer's biggest customers, while Dell is its biggest competitor. Before going further, do note that Super Micro Computer reported $5.65 billion in revenue for its fiscal Q2'25 and guided to a range of between $5 billion and $6 billion in revenue for its fiscal Q3'25 (March-ending quarter), which corresponds to a QoQ decline of ~6 percent at the low-end, and a QoQ increase of ~12 percent at the high-end of the range. Coming back, Chokshi notes that the stated trajectory of Super Micro Computer's March-ending quarter - "guided down 12% q/q to up 6% q/q" - is largely a function of the fact that the company's GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) customers "are unlikely to be at the front of the Blackwell queue." Here, Chokshi adds additional color by noting that Blackwell GPUs constituted ~31 percent of NVIDIA's January-ending quarter revenue, "driving NVDA data center revenue up 16% q/q, implying Hopper shipments down 20% q/q." Chokshi also notes that "consensus for DELL servers and networking is being projected flat q/q for the April Q, consistent with SMCI midpoint guidance, leading us to believe NVDA Blackwell shipments for the Jan Q indexed towards hyperscalers that DELL nor SMCI typically serve." Bear in mind that there is a roughly 8-week lag between when NVIDIA recognizes GPU revenue to when server OEMs recognize their top-line metric. So, according to Chokshi, Super Micro Computer's near-term revenue is being impacted by NVIDIA's Blackwell queue and its preferential treatment of hyperscalers.

Title: The dot-com bubble burst 25 years ago. What does that history say about stocks today?
URL: https://qz.com/dot-com-bubble-stock-market-crash-anniversary-ai-1851767436
Time Published: 2025-03-06T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
On March 10, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index peaked at 5,048.62, more than double its value from just a year earlier. Internet startups with “dot-com” slapped on the end of their names and little more than ideas to sell to investors had soared to astronomical valuations over the previous five years. But all parties come to an end. Within weeks of that high, the index began its fall, with a mix of factors spooking investors. Eventually, the Nasdaq shed more than 75% of its value, wiping out $5 trillion in market capitalization. The age of irrational exuberance was over. A quarter-century later, the rise of AI has market veterans debating whether history repeats, or merely runs the same bubble algorithm with new inputs. Some market watchers see structural differences preventing an immediate collapse, while tech critics warn we’re debugging the same old bubble logic. Beyond balance sheets lies a deeper concern: We keep forgetting that the social costs of tech revolutions outlast their market corrections. There are similarities between the market today and 25 years ago as some investors grow nervous, according to Kairong Xiao, a finance professor at Columbia Business School. But if the moment we are in ends up bursting, the market structure means things will look different than 2000. “The dot-com bubble was characterized by a lot of IPOs, with companies trying to get into the biggest asset class in the Nasdaq” Xiao said. “Today, due to regulation and many other structural changes, new investments nowadays have been through the private equity market.” That structural shift from public to private funding represents one of the most significant changes. While Netscape’s 1995 IPO sparked a gold rush of public offerings from internet startups, today’s most prominent AI developers — OpenAI and Anthropic — remain private despite valuations in the tens of billions. They can access enormous capital without facing public market scrutiny or quarterly earnings pressure. The companies leading today’s tech wave also differ markedly from their dot-com predecessors. In 2000, many market darlings were freshly minted startups with minimal revenue. Today, AI innovation is largely funded by cash-rich tech giants including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA), companies with diverse revenue streams and substantial profits. This concentration of resources among established players may provide a cushion against market volatility that didn’t exist during the dot-com era. “The big companies can survive if there’s a crash in the market because they have other ways to raise financing, whereas the small guys get eliminated,” Xiao said. Yet not all market observers are convinced we’ll avoid a reckoning entirely. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said today’s AI boom has runway left — but also an expiration date. “I still think we got another two good years left in the market,” Munster said. “Unfortunately, it’s gonna end in the same way that it did 25 years ago.” For Munster, the key indicator isn’t current valuations but the psychological state of the market, which he sees as “euphoric” right now. He defines euphoria — that intoxicating moment when rational investing gives way to the fear-of-missing-out — as when the forward price-to-earnings multiple exceeds 50 times. Today’s Nasdaq trades around 25 times earnings. But Munster said that euphoric threshold could be reached by 2027, potentially triggering what he described as a “spectacular burst.” While Munster said he believes the substance of AI will eventually exceed the hype, that likely won’t happen in time to avoid a market correction. “By the time the numbers start to improve, the bubble will have burst,” Munster said. “I lived through the dot-com bubble. I don’t want to see people’s lives get blown up, but I also think that AI is going to be more impactful than the internet.” Yet for all the structural differences between eras, some experts warn that we risk repeating the same fundamental mistakes. Mar Hicks, a history of technology professor at the University of Virginia and author of “Programmed Inequality,” said our retrospective view of previous tech bubbles often minimizes their negative impacts. Those harms, Hicks said, include substantial erosion of privacy norms and labor market transformations that began during the first internet boom. Early e-commerce companies like Kozmo.com used venture capital to offer services at unsustainably low prices, conditioning consumers to expect convenience without cost — a precursor to today’s gig economy. “That led to getting people used to this idea that you can have anything for free, essentially,” Hicks said. “It made it so that people either didn’t think about the labor and paying the labor of the people who are doing this work, or it completely changed the structure of the labor market.” Hicks suggested that while Silicon Valley’s memory may be short, its executives aren’t entirely forgetting history — they’re strategically misremembering it. Today’s AI leaders appear to have studied the dot-com collapse primarily as a public relations case study rather than a substantive business lesson. “The way in which they’re being mindful is they now know what they have to say in order to maybe get people to not get upset about these new revolutionary technologies,” Hicks said. “They’re giving lip service to it because they don’t ever address any of the real problems.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia Stock: Are Tariff Fears Overblown?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia stock fell nearly 9% during Monday’s trading session, while the broader Nasdaq index declined by just over 2%. The market-wide sell-off coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump’s confirmation that his administration would impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday. Additionally, Nvidia’s drop was further exacerbated by investigations into Chinese buyers suspected of bypassing U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductor chips. How will these developments affect Nvidia stock? We do not believe that the Trump Administration’s initial tariffs will have a material impact on Nvidia. Nvidia’s chips are primarily manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan; however, some systems and computers utilizing these chips are produced in other regions, including Mexico. It is possible that these segments of the business might experience some impact. Nonetheless, the core of Nvidia’s operations—the high-margin GPU division—should remain mostly unaffected. Last month, President Trump also suggested the possibility of a “25% or higher” tariff on all semiconductor chips imported into the United States. Investors will need to monitor this development closely, although we believe it will not have a significant impact on Nvidia’s bottom line. As of 2024, Nvidia reported an adjusted gross margin of approximately 75.5%, indicating that the cost of its imported products is likely less than 25% of its revenues. Furthermore, since Nvidia generates around 47% of its sales from the U.S., the impact on its margins is probably even more constrained. In addition, TSMC, which is Nvidia’s main contract manufacturer for GPUs, has announced plans to invest roughly $100 billion in new chip fabrication facilities in the United States. Nvidia executives have indicated that they plan to produce chips at these new facilities, potentially helping the company mitigate long-term tariff risks. However, if you are seeking growth with less volatility than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since its inception. The United States has implemented export control restrictions on most of Nvidia’s newest AI chipset offerings to China, with the exception of the H20 chips, due to national security concerns. Nevertheless, reports indicate that gray market resellers are utilizing entities registered outside China to purchase servers incorporating Nvidia’s latest offerings from companies based in several countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This concern is substantiated by the fact that Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, representing approximately $23 billion in sales in FY’25, or about 18% of revenue, compared to only $2.3 billion, or 8% of revenue, in FY’23. Singapore has now launched an investigation into these potential loopholes. The emergence of China’s DeepSeek open-source AI model also suggests that the country is advancing significantly in AI, with both prominent startups and major companies like Alibaba and Baidu investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Should Chinese companies bypass sanctions and face stricter enforcement measures that eventually close these loopholes, Nvidia’s revenues could be affected. Over the past four years, NVDA stock's performance has been inconsistent, with annual returns displaying much greater volatility than the S&P 500. The stock returned 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, exhibits significantly less volatility. It has also comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this the case? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less turbulent performance as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In light of the current uncertain macroeconomic climate, marked by potential rate cuts and several conflicts, might NVDA experience a scenario similar to 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months, or will it experience a robust surge? We estimate Nvidia stock to be valued at approximately $101 per share, which is about 20% below the current market price. Refer to our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap. There are several reasons why we currently hold a negative outlook on the stock. We believe that the AI wave, driven by a “fear-of-missing-out” over the past two years, might subside due to diminishing incremental performance improvements from larger models and because high-quality training data may become a bottleneck. This transition towards more efficient models could further intensify the effects of a potential slowdown for GPU manufacturers like Nvidia. Additionally, Nvidia is encountering increasing competition from companies such as AMD and even from its own clients, like Amazon, which are focusing on developing and deploying their own AI chips. Although Nvidia boasts a comprehensive software ecosystem surrounding its AI processors—including programming languages that help secure customer loyalty—the company could still face pressure. Its premium valuation might not fully account for these risks at present. NVDA Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth

Title: Trump tariffs are a risk for Big Tech. But 'don't run for the hills,' analysts say

Time Published: 2025-03-04T20:53:00Z

President Donald Trump’s broad-ranging tariffs went into effect earlier Tuesday, sending the market in a downward spiral. The United States will be enacting 25% duties on all Mexican goods and most Canadian goods, and 20% on all imports from China. Retaliatory tariffs followed promptly: Canada imposed 25% tariff on $107 billion worth of American goods, as China announced duties of up to 15% on agricultural products and targeted actions at more than 20 companies, including artificial intelligence startups and drone makers. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said she will announce retaliatory measures on Sunday. The tech industry is wary. Shares of Tesla (TSLA-0.21%), which owns a major assembly plant in China, were down more than 3% in Tuesday late afternoon trading. The stock gained back some of its losses from earlier in the day when several investors downgraded the stock due to tariff fears. Retailer Best Buy (BBY+0.14%) warned investors that the duties could increase the price of the electronics it sells. “In terms of visibility of goods, I’d say Apple (AAPL+1.97%) and Tesla are probably the headliners,” D.A. Davidson head of technology Gil Luria told Quartz. But the tariffs and their immediate impact is by no means unexpected by global markets as Trump made his fondness of tariffs clear even on the campaign trail. Tech analysts are more worried about how long the tariffs will last, as well as whether or not further escalation in reciprocals will occur — and if they’ll extend beyond tariffs on physical goods. “It’s far more likely that this time, they’re going to hurt the U.S. where it matters,” Luria said, adding that the big tech companies are “the best target.” If Canada, Mexico or China decide that the U.S. has taken a confrontational approach to tariffs, they can respond in kind by penalizing big tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT-1.50%), Google (GOOGL+0.86%), Meta (META-1.17%) or Amazon (AMZN-1.51%). This, Luria said, would be “the most meaningful and most broad in its impact.” “In China, for instance, they can just eliminate the sales of iPhone altogether,” Luria said. “These are all things that any country that the U.S. is getting into a confrontation with could decide to do in order to exert pressure on the U.S. to reduce those tariffs.” Following the first set of 10% tariffs on Chinese imports last month, Beijing was quick to retaliate with an investigation into alleged antitrust violations by Google while reportedly laying the groundwork for a formal probe into Apple’s App Store. Last month, the Financial Times reported that the EU is ready to impose retaliatory measures on Big Tech companies in the case of a potential dispute with the Trump administration. Trump has threatened to use tariffs on the EU several times. But some are optimistic that things won’t escalate to that point. “As we navigated in 2018/2019 we caution this is all a game of high stakes poker to get other countries to the negotiating table and will very likely not last for an elongated period of time,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in Tuesday morning’s note. An aggressive approach towards China and chip export controls is “the biggest risk” to the artificial intelligence trade, according to Ives. Nvidia (NVDA+0.45%) stock closed down 8.7% on Monday after Singaporean police uncovered an illegal export operation aiming to take servers containing Nvidia chips to mainland China in violation of American chip export controls that the market fears the U.S. might now further restrict. “Outside of the U.S., there’s been a surprising amount of openness to working on DeepSeek models, and the more the U.S. alienates its trading partners, the more likely they are to gravitate to Chinese models,” Luria said. But any slowdown in the AI trade associated with these tariff-borne near-term risks will be short-lived, according to Wedbush analysts. “Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Palantir (PLTR+3.74%), Salesforce (CRM-1.93%), Tesla, Apple will remain the stocks to own and any weakness is a buying opportunity in our view given the fundamental demand picture,” Ives wrote. “This will be an ‘uncomfortable time for growth investors’... but ultimately this is not the time to run for the hills in the tech trade and instead own these tech AI winners.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as President Donald Trump’s newly imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China prompted retaliatory measures from some of the affected countries. China imposed additional duties of up to 15% on certain U.S. products. Ottawa retaliated with 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Tuesday, rising to cover $125 billion of merchandise in 21 days. Canada’s provinces are taking their own actions, and irate citizens are boycotting U.S. products. As the day ended in New York, the Nasdaq Composite dipped by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 670 points or 1.5%. The S&P 500, which had its worst day of the year on Monday, dropped 1.2%. Here are stocks to watch on Tuesday. Best Buy (BBY+0.14%) stock dropped after the electronics retailer reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. However, CEO Corie Barry indicated that prices for U.S. consumers are likely to increase due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG-3.57%) shares declined due to concerns about the restaurant chain’s dependence on avocados, with 50% of its supply coming from Mexico. As tariffs on imports from Mexico take effect, investors are worried about the potential impact on the company. The company has said its diverse supply chain could help it withstand tariffs. Nvidia (NVDA+0.45% stock fell as concerns mounted over AI-related spending and the impact of new tariffs. The chip manufacturer seems to be cautious about limitations on the export of AI chips. Nvidia stock plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.28%, a key player in AI hardware, also declined in the morning, mirroring Nvidia’s slump. Investors are uncertain about how Trump’s tariffs could shape the future of the AI industry. However, the stock recovered in the afternoon by gaining 10%. Shares of Target (TGT-0.16%) were down as it beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations. For the fourth quarter, the company reported revenue of $30.92 billion, about $2.41 earnings per share. But Target said it expects a “meaningful” decline in first-quarter profits compared to the same period last year. The cautious outlook stems from “ongoing consumer uncertainty,” weaker sales in February, and mounting concerns over the impact of tariffs. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico, and China — which together accounted for almost 42% of total imports in 2024 — went into effect early Tuesday. Tesla (TSLA-0.21% stock declined due to rising fears about tariffs among investors. It is likely that the new tariff will raise car prices. Moreover, a day after Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas designated Tesla stock as a “Top Pick” in the U.S. automotive sector and raised the price target, Bank of America reduced its price target for the stock from $490 to $380 while maintaining a Neutral rating.

Title: 6 Vanguard Index Funds To Buy Now

Time Published: 2025-03-03T21:33:34Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock , Contributor. Whether you're building a new&nbsp;ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds ... [+] are worth a look. Experienced and novice investors love Vanguard index funds. In October 2024, Morningstar estimated Vanguard had a leading 29% market share in U.S. assets under management. Let's explore what makes this fund family so popular and meet six Vanguard funds performing well against their peers. Many investors choose Vanguard index funds for their low expense ratios and attractive market exposures. The Vanguard name is also well-regarded as the original index fund manager—the company launched the first index fund in 1976. A fund's expense ratio quantifies how much shareholders pay for the fund's administrative costs. Fund expenses dilute returns, so a lower ratio is better. Index funds normally have low expense ratios because they are cheaper to operate than actively managed funds. Vanguard is proudly a low-cost provider of this already cost-efficient investment product. In February 2025, the company lowered expense ratios across 87 funds. Vanguard estimates the reduction will save investors $350 million in 2025. One strategy to identify the best and cheapest Vanguard index funds is to screen on expense ratios and Morningstar Ratings. The Morningstar Rating is a comparative measure of a fund’s risk-adjusted returns. A five-star rating, the highest possible, indicates a fund has historically performed well against its peers. Note that Morningstar re-rates funds monthly, and ratings do not guarantee future performance. See Morningstar Ratings 101 for more information. As of late February 2025, nine Vanguard funds had five-star ratings. Those nine funds were ordered from lowest expense ratio to highest. The top six were selected for inclusion. The table below includes six Vanguard funds with five-star Morningstar Ratings and expense ratios below 0.10%. Ratings are from Morningstar and fund metrics are from Vanguard.com. For more fund investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF invests in every S&P 500 company. The fund's goal is to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 index, commonly used as a benchmark for the entire stock market. VOO’s predecessor was Vanguard's First Index Investment Trust, launched in 1976. Today, VOO is the world's largest ETF with $1.4 trillion in net assets. VOO has the elements of a solid core holding: The 0.03% expense ratio is cost-efficient, and the portfolio provides exposure to an appealing segment. The S&P 500 includes the largest, most successful companies on U.S. stock exchanges. The index can be volatile but has historically delivered a long-term annualized return of 7% net of inflation. Vanguard's mega-cap fund tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. The index includes 195 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. Historically, large companies were often more stable and predictable than their smaller counterparts. For that reason, many conservative equity investors favored mega-cap and blue-chip stocks. That trend has changed. Today, technology companies dominate market-cap-weighted indexes. For example, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA)—a stock known for its volatility—is the third largest company in the S&P 500 and the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. Still, the MGC portfolio offers an interesting collection of stocks. The holdings include growth players like Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), alongside value plays like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). You get these same top stocks in an S&P 500 fund but with less concentration. Head-to-head, the mega-cap index outperforms the S&P 500 slightly, albeit with more volatility. The Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF replicates the CRSP US Mega Cap Value Index. The index includes the largest value stocks, covering about 70% of U.S. market capitalization. There are 136 index constituents. The value focus of MGV should appeal to bargain-hunting, risk-averse equity investors. You won’t find too many fast-moving tech stocks in this portfolio. The fund favors financials, health care and industrials. The technology sector is represented but by less prominent stocks such as Broadcom (AVGO), IBM (IBM) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Relative to VOO, MGV has produced slightly lower returns. The fund does deliver a reasonable yield of 2.06%, so it might be a candidate for those who favor dividend ETFs. Vanguard's VONG fund invests in Russell 1000 Growth stocks. This index currently includes 395 Russell 1000 stocks with higher price-to-book ratios, higher two-year earnings forecasts and higher five-year sales-per-share growth. VONG provides nice return potential by focusing on stocks with growth characteristics. The earnings growth rate for this portfolio is 24.9%. The same metric for VOO is 18.9%. This fund has outperformed the others on this list, with a five-year average annual return of 18.82%. High concentrations of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon (AMZN) have driven much of that growth. One trade-off for the appreciation potential is lower cash returns. VONG's 30-day SEC yield is 0.48%. Vanguard's health care fund invests in about 400 large, mid and small cap companies that provide medical products, services or technology. The benchmark index is the MSCI US IMI Health Care 25/50. According to a Deloitte survey in December 2024, health care industry leaders are mostly optimistic about the year ahead. Nearly 70% of survey respondents expect a 2025 revenue increase and 71% expect a boost in profits. VHT is a good position for capitalizing on higher health care profits. Like all funds on this list, VHT has performed well against peers. It also has a low expense ratio of 0.09% and pays a moderate SEC 30-day yield of 1.38%. The portfolio includes Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly (LLY), diversified health care company UnitedHealth (UNH) and biopharma Abbvie (ABBV). Vanguard's technology ETF holds large, mid and small tech stocks, including hardware and software providers and semiconductor companies. The benchmark index is MSCI US IMI Info Technology 25/50. AI has fueled a surge in tech stocks over the last two years. Many experts believe the trend will continue. According to The Wall Street Journal, AI spending is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 29% between 2024 and 2028. VGT provides broad exposure to the technology sector, from Nvidia and other big names to exciting mid-caps like Astera Labs (ALAB). Note that the fund is market-cap-weighted, so the mega caps will drive the overall performance. That could be good or bad, depending on your outlook and risk tolerance. Bottom Line Whether you're building a new ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds are worth a look. They have low fees and cover popular market segments, broad to niche. You can double-down on growth, find value bargains or tweak your sector exposure. It’s no wonder Vanguard is the most popular fund family in the U.S.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks slid Monday as investors braced for President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico to go into effect by the midnight deadline. The Dow tumbled 650 points, or 1.48%, to close at 43,191. The Dow fell almost 900 points in afternoon trading before pulling back slightly. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.76% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.64%. The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day decline of the year. The Nasdaq is down about 6.5% since since Trump took office on January 20. “Tomorrow, tariffs — 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “And that’ll start. … What they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.” Trump said the two trading partners had “no room” left to negotiate to avoid the levies and that he was using tariffs to “punish” countries that, as he put it, were taking from the US economy without giving enough in return. “They’re all set. They go into effect tomorrow,” he said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would immediately respond with tariffs on $30 billion of US goods if the Trump administration’s measures go into effect. “Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,” he said in a statement. Trump also signed an executive order on Monday raising tariffs on imports from China to 20%, up from 10%. Trump said the tariffs, aimed at bringing China to the table on curtailing fentanyl entering the United States, will be raised because Beijing has not done enough to stem the flow of illegal drugs. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged to its highest point this year after Trump’s comments. “Due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, the stock market has erased the gains from the ‘Trump bump’ following the presidential election and the expected upward pressure on prices is giving investors pause,” said Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University. “For investors, 2025 can still be a positive year for stocks, but it may take all year to realize gains. And they may be modest,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group. “I’m still a bull,” Bolvin said. The import taxes Trump imposed are significant — the largest in US-China history. The initial tariffs, which went into effect February 4, set in motion tariffs on $1.4 trillion of imported goods. That’s more than triple the $380 billion worth of foreign goods that were hit with tariffs during Trump’s first term, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday the country was “strongly dissatisfied” and “firmly opposed” the additional tariff. “(China) will take countermeasures to firmly safeguard its own rights and interests,” the spokesperson added in a statement. Before he became president, Trump pledged a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, so the tariff level could rise still. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference about tariffs on Canada and Mexico that global companies can avoid tariffs if they invest into production in the United States, like TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker at the White House on Monday to announce a $100 billion US investment. Related article Trump’s tariff chaos threatens an economy already flashing yellow lights Trump’s tariffs will raise prices of imported goods, which could boost demand for goods produced in the US, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. But they also noted that tariffs will have negative effects on some American businesses. “Tariff increases will also raise production costs for some domestic producers and will likely prompt foreign retaliation against some US exports, both of which could hurt domestic production,” they wrote in a note. US stocks are “likely to be volatile” until Trump’s policies point toward being more growth-focused, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Monday. Draho said he does expect future growth and maintains a “positive medium-term outlook.” The stock market began to slide Monday morning to begin the new month, as investors digested the latest manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management. The survey showed economic activity in the manufacturing industry remained in expansion territory, yet slowed last month. Tariff fears dominated write-in responses to the survey. Markets slid Monday afternoon after Trump posted on Truth Social that he plans to implement tariffs on “external product[s],” potentially including agricultural products. Trump’s post referred to his plan for reciprocal tariffs, set to take place on April 2, according to a person familiar, though it was not immediately clear how these tariffs would be implemented. “To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!” Trump said in the post. Related article Trump’s tariffs chaos is contributing to delivery delays of goods The sentiment driving markets on Monday dipped into “extreme fear” after Trump’s confirmation that tariffs will go into effect on Tuesday, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. The stocks dragging markets lower on Monday included Nvidia (NVDA), which fell 8.7%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 4.16%, signaling concerns about uncertainty and future economic growth. Bitcoin traded around $85,600 on Monday afternoon, down 8.6% in the past day and largely erasing gains made after Trump on Sunday announced a strategic crypto reserve that would include bitcoin. Meanwhile, shares in defense companies in Europe soared to record highs on Monday as European leaders consider the need to re-arm amid less US support for Ukraine. WTI crude, the US oil benchmark, fell about 2% to its lowest price since December after OPEC+ announced it would begin producing more oil in April.

Title: Major U-Turn in Crypto Markets Sends Bitcoin Back Below $87K

Sunday's Trump bump in crypto has mostly vanished nearly as quickly as it appeared. In mid-afternoon U.S. action, bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $86,700, barely above its level prior to President Trump taking to social media Sunday to tout his plans for coming U.S. crypto reserve. Ether is now actually beneath its pre-Trump level and at 0.025, the ETH/BTC ratio has touched a new five-year low. Other tokens touted by Trump as part of the coming crypto reserve — Solana's (SOL), Ripple's (XRP) and Cardano's (ADA) — have given up sizable amounts of their Sunday gains, though remain somewhat higher than prior to the president's posting. “Crypto vols are still relatively elevated with both majors still reflecting a Put Skew till end-March,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote to their investors. “The VIX is also elevated, signaling broader market unease in risk assets overall, particularly after the recent tariff escalations from the U.S. administration.” Crypto stocks have given up large chunks are early gains on Monday, with a number of them — Core Scientific (CORZ) and Bitdeer (BTDR) among them — now sporting sizable losses on the session. Medical equipment maker Semler Scientific (SMLR) — perhaps better-known for its bitcoin treasury strategy — is off 7.3% today after a DOJ investigation for possible violations of a federal anti-fraud law related to its marketing of a product known as QuantaFlo, reported Stat News. The broader stock market is also in the red, with the Nasdaq shedding 1.1% and S&P 500 0.8% ahead of Trump's promised tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China. Chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA) is down 6.5% on news that Singapore has charged three men in a U.S. export controls breach case. “Concerns over U.S. growth, and impending tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada — set to take effect tomorrow — will be in focus, driving equities and rates,” said Jake Ostrovskis, OTC Trader at crypto market maker Wintermute. Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America. He has a bachelor's degree in English literature from McGill University, and can usually be found in Costa Rica. He holds BTC above CoinDesk's disclosure threshold of $1,000. About Contact

Title: Nvidia and Super Micro Computer stock plunge as a new probe over China raises concerns about tighter scrutiny

Nvidia (NVDA+0.45%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.28%), and Dell (DELL-2.81%) shares plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Police in the city-state arrested several people for their alleged roles in procuring and shipping Nvidia chips in violation of American sanctions, Bloomberg reports. The U.S. has been investigating whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek had circumvented curbs that way, it said earlier. Singapore is seeking further information from Malaysia and the U.S. to determine the final destination of the Dell and Super Micro Computer servers, Law Minister K. Shanmugam told reporters on Monday. The purchasers had misled suppliers about the ultimate destination of the equipment, he said. The investigation risks increasing U.S. scrutiny of equipment exports by the American companies, a potential drag on sales growth. The news also comes amid investor caution ahead of the scheduled implementation of higher U.S. tariffs on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Nvidia stock closed down 8.7% on Monday. Super Micro shares fell 13%, and Dell slipped 7%. Intel (INTC-1.49%) stock closed down 4.2%, giving giving up a gain earlier in the day driven by a report that its faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO+7.53%) are testing chip manufacturing with Intel on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for AI, Reuters reports. Broadcom, due to report earnings on Thursday, dropped more than 6%. The U.S.-traded shares of top chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSM-0.72%) (TSMC) fell 4.2%.

The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed significantly lower. The Dow fell 650 points, or about 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was off 1.8% and the Nasdaq closed down 2.6%. Automakers, among the companies most affected by tariffs, gave up earlier gains and fell after President Trump reiterated that the duties will go into effect tomorrow. Ford (F+3.07%) dropped 1.7%, General Motors (GM+0.43%) declined 3.6% and Stellantis (STLA-0.04%) slipped 3%. All three have plants in Mexico and Canada. Tesla (TSLA-0.21%) fell 2.8%. Nvidia (NVDA+0.45%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.28%), and Dell (DELL-2.81%) shares plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Stock in Intel (INTC-1.49%), Broadcom (AVGO+7.53%) and TSMC (TSM-0.72%) also declined. Kroger (KR+4.59%) stock fell 2.9% after CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an investigation into his personal conduct. The grocery chain unveils its earnings report on Thursday. Weyerhaeuser (WY+1.98%) stock gained 4.3% after Trump ordered a probe of lumber imports on national security grounds. Las Vegas Sands’ (LVS-1.21%) stock 1.6% rose after the casino operator completed a debt restructuring involving its Marina Bay Sands liabilities.

Title: Intel could get a boost from Nvidia and Broadcom

Intel’s (INTC-1.49%) faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia (NVDA+0.45%) and Broadcom (AVGO+7.53%) are testing chip manufacturing with the chip pioneer on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for artificial intelligence, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The tests are being carried out as the two chip designers decide on manufacturing contracts with Intel that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Reuters — a move that could be a turnaround for Intel’s declining business. Intel’s shares were up by 3.2% during Monday morning trading, and are up by 22% so far this year. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.17%) reportedly also is interested in using Intel for manufacturing, but it is not confirmed if the company is testing chips. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that it sees “strong interest and engagement on Intel 18A across our ecosystem.” Neither Intel, Broadcom, nor AMD immediately responded to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. In September, Reuters reported that Intel’s tests with Broadcom on its 18A process had failed, after Broadcom’s engineers determined it could not be used for high-volume chip production. The current tests with Nvidia and Broadcom are focused on the viability of Intel’s 18A manufacturing process and are not using finished chip designs, Reuters reported, adding that the tests could take months. In February 2024, Microsoft (MSFT-1.50%) announced that it was tapping Intel’s 18A manufacturing process for a future chip designed in-house. Former Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger had started Intel’s contract manufacturing business in 2021, but it has not yet secured a major chip designer partner. Intel previously pushed back the 18A process to 2026, but is now delaying it by another six months, Reuters reported, citing supplier documents and unnamed people familiar with the matter. The delay has to do with qualifying intellectual property for the manufacturing process, according to Reuters. Intel told Reuters that it plans to “begin ramping production in the second half of this year, delivering on the commitments we have made to our customers.” Meanwhile, Intel has become an acquisition target for its competitors. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel could see its business split in two by separate potential deals with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-0.72%). Broadcom is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while TSMC is interested in its chip manufacturing plants.

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer , Contributor. Munich, Bavaria Germany - December 11 2022: Amazon Deutschland Services GmbH e-commerce german ... [+] headquarters office building with glass green trademark logo. Ultra HD During a recent client meeting, I talked about Amazon (AMZN) and did a deep dive into its valuation. The results were shocking. When you look under the hood of the stock’s valuation, you see that the market’s expectations for future cash flows are shockingly high. Shocking. Let’s get specific Expectations Investing Analysis on AMZN As I do for all of my Reverse DCF Case Studies, I use my firm’s valuation models to quantify the future performance of the company required to justify its current stock price. Specifically, my model shows that to justify ~$239/share Amazon would have to: Let’s put some context around those expectations. Benchmarking Expectations for AMZN First, growing revenue at 10.9% CAGR for 39 years means Amazon’s revenue would be $32.2 trillion in 2063. $32.2. trillion is 26% greater than the United States’ GDP in 2024. $32.2. trillion would also rank Amazon as the third largest GDP in the world in 2063. See Figure 1 for details. Figure 1: Comparing Amazon’s Revenue to the GDP of the Largest Countries in the World Comparing AMZN Revenue To GDP Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. 2024 GDP stats from Global PEO Services *2063 GDP values assume a 4% nominal compounded annual growth rate. It is important to note that the stock price embeds expectations for revenue reaching $32.2 trillion while Amazon – also – increases its ROIC from 14% to 64%. I think there are several reasons why the expectations embedded in Amazon’s current stock price are too high. Competitive Realities Large revenue growth, like what’s embedded in Amazon’s stock price, implies significant market share gains. I note that market share gains are typically won with lower prices, which are not possible with a company that must also increase its ROIC to very high levels. Specifically, a 14% ROIC ranks 135th in the S&P 500 while a 64% ROIC ranks 11th, behind firms like Apple (AAPL), Mastercard (MA) and Nvidia (NVDA). In other words, Amazon’s stock price is implying a doubly-incredible future where the company enjoys huge revenue growth and ROIC improvement as well. Currently, only one company, Apple, ranks in the top 10 of the S&P 500 for ROIC (7th) and revenue (3rd). Amazon’s trailing 12 months revenue ($620 billion) ranks #2 in the S&P 500, just behind Walmart (WMT) at $674 billion. For reference, Walmart’s ROIC is 11%. So, hypothetically, Amazon would only need to dramatically improve its ROIC rank to join Apple as one of the few companies to rank so highly for ROIC and revenue at the same time. Expectations Investing Applied Too few investors have the tools to unveil the details behind stock valuations. I make it clear and easy. Math is math. It’s not supposed to be hard. Wall Street wants to keep you in the dark by making you think it is too hard to get the truth about valuation. I shed light into the dark corners of the market and make them into opportunities to profit. I think the MOMO, YOLO, SPAC, NFT, meme stock and meme coin trading ploys are bad for investors, bad for our stock market, and bad for our country. I’m here to give you proven-superior investment research that is good for the long-term health of your portfolio and your peace of mind.
