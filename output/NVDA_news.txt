Pulling numbered balls out of a mixing machine. Tracking the twitch of a mouse cursor. Converting lava lamp motion into data. These are just a few ways real-world randomness is generated—essential for things like lotteries and Internet encryption, where unpredictability equals security. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Transmitting that randomness over the Internet, however, is a different story. Physically random processes are hard to verify remotely, and by design, traditional computers can’t generate true randomness. But a new quantum breakthrough may have solved the problem. Published yesterday (May 26) in Nature, a study from JPMorgan Chase researchers—alongside collaborators at Argonne and Oak Ridge national labs and the University of Texas at Austin—demonstrates how a quantum computer generates “certified” randomness. Quantum computers don’t use ordinary bits but qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once and collapse into intrinsically random outcomes. Using a 56-qubit quantum computer from Quantinuum, the researchers produced random numbers that were then verified by classic supercomputers. “It’s the first experimental demonstration of the use of a quantum computer to generate certified random numbers,” said Scott Aaronson, the UT Austin professor who introduced the randomness protocol used in the study, in an interview with Observer. Quantum computing has attracted increasing attention from tech and financial firms, which hope to use it to solve problems today’s supercomputers cannot. JPMorgan’s Marco Pistoia, head of global tech applied research, called the result a major milestone—not just for quantum hardware but also for fields like statistical sampling, simulation and cryptography. Even so, certified randomness won’t be hitting your phone tomorrow. Aaronson noted that verifying the results is still costly. “I don’t expect this to be an application that changes the world,” he said. “But it is one of the first uses of a quantum computer for anything that I couldn’t say for certain is useless.” JPMorgan isn’t alone in chasing quantum breakthroughs, which, by some estimates, could grow by $2 trillion in the next 15 years. In early 2025, Google (GOOGL) unveiled Willow, a quantum chip that completes in five minutes a benchmark task that would take today’s best supercomputers 10 septillion years. In February, Microsoft (MSFT) created its Majorana 1 chip using a rare new state of matter known as a “topological state.” Even Nvidia (NVDA)’s Jensen Huang—who once tanked quantum stocks by questioning the field’s relevance—has softened his stance. Earlier this month, the chipmaking executive walked back his critique while announcing a new Nvidia-backed quantum research facility in Boston.

Stocks’ losses eased after data showed the labor market holding up and fourth-quarter economic growth was revised higher. The good news helped temper the impact of Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on cars, trucks and auto parts — which sent General Motors (GM-1.37%) and some peers down. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated after fourth-quarter GDP growth was revised up 2.4% annually from 2.3%, reflecting higher investment and a downward revision to import growth. New filings for jobless benefits remained steady in the week to March 22, as did continuing claims for the priror week. “Hard to see recession in these data, but the real test will be the initial read on Q1 2025 GDP, when the trade shocks feed into the numbers — that may not look so rosy,” Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in an email. “The labor market is far stronger and resilient than folks appreciate.” Automakers weren’t a big beneficiary of the batter data, as they face higher costs under Trump’s tariffs that they’ll either have to absorb or pass on to customers. JPMorgan (JPM-2.26%) downgraded its price targets for GM, Ford (F-2.12%) and Ferrari (RACE+0.57%). GM stock plunged 6.5%, Ford declined 2%, and Stellantis (STLA-4.19%) fell 1.5%. The U.S.-traded shares of some foreign automakers slid, with Toyota (TM-2.84%) and Honda (HMC-5.35%) both falling more than 2%. Ferrari reversed an earlier decline after saying it’ll raise American prices for its cars by up to 10% after the tariffs go into effect April 2. Tesla (TSLA-3.99%), one of the automakers least affected by the tariffs, rebounded from initial lows to trade more than 3% higher. Elon Musk said the electric vehicle makers, which relies on some imported parts, will take a hit from the tariffs. Nvidia (NVDA-1.50%) stock slid about 1.2% after dropping 5.7% yesterday. Beijing has asked firms in China to use energy-efficient chips in data centers, the Financial Times reported on March 25. GameStop (GME-1.18%) plunged 25%, more than surrendering its gain yesterday after it announced plans to raise $1.3 billion by selling convertible senior notes due 2030 to finance Bitcoin investments. Jefferies (JEF-3.97%) stock plunged more than 9% after the investment bank’s quarterly earnings missed expectations, with revenue 14.5% below the StreetAccount consensus forecast and earnings per share 39% lower. Concentrix (CNXC-13.35%) stock jumped 37% after the outsourcing company’s quarterly per-share profit of $2.79 exceeded expectations by about 8.1%, and CEO Chris Caldwell used the earnings call to express confidence in the firms AI strategy. —With reporting by William Gavin Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Why May 15 is a key date to watch for Nvidia stock

Nvidia investors have a key catalyst on the horizon, according to Bank of America. Strategists at the bank are watching May 15, the day the US government will roll out the so-called AI Diffusion Rule, a regulatory framework that aims to control foreign countries' access to high-tech chips from the US. The rules would impose restrictions on some sales of Nvidia's chips and potentially narrow its market, but the event could actually end up being positive for Nvidia stock. That's because the company could recover from its recent slump once wider geopolitical concerns are "sized and priced," the bank said on Thursday. "There is a wide range of outcomes, and NVDA stock could stay volatile till the May-15 date, aka 'Liberation Day' as a catalyst when the impact could be reflected in the stock," strategists said. There are several other catalysts that could boost Nvidia stock, the bank said. Strategists pointed to a potential recovery in GM, which announced a partnership with Nvidia earlier this month, as well as Nvidia's new Blackwell Ultra chip. In its most recent earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's existing Blackwell chip was "extraordinary." "Meanwhile, we believe the stock is providing a particularly attractive opportunity for one of the most unique, high-quality tech franchises leading the largest and fastest growing secular trends," the bank said. Bank of America reiterated its "Buy" rating on the chipmaker and issued a price target of $200 a share, implying 75% upside from current levels. The stock was trading around $113 on Thursday morning and is down 18% year-to-date. After back-to-back years of stellar growth, Nvidia stock has lost momentum this year thanks to budding concerns about US AI dominance, as well as jitters related to tariffs and the outlook for the economy. Earlier this month, investors had their eyes set on Nvidia's GPU Tech Conference, dubbed the "Super Bowl of AI," where Huang gave key updates on the firm's new projects and what it sees for the path ahead. Shares have sagged this week on news that Nvidia is at risk of losing business in China, thanks to new energy-efficiency rules that would bar sales of some chips. The stock fell as much as 5% Wednesday morning and edged lower another 1% on Thursday. Jump to

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares lost ground Thursday as Jefferies analysts downgraded the stock, saying they expect the performance gap between AMD's latest products and Nvidia's (NVDA) to widen. The analysts downgraded AMD's stock to a "hold" and cut their price target to $120, down from a "buy" rating and $135 price target previously. That's well below the $139 average target of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, five of whom have issued "hold" ratings, compared to seven "buy" and one "sell" rating. AMD shares were down close to 4% near $106 in recent trading Thursday, and have lost more than 40% of their value over the last 12 months. Citing performance tests conducted with three open-source artificial intelligence (AI) models in recent weeks, Jefferies wrote that Nvidia's H200 graphics processing unit (GPU) still has a "significant performance advantage" over AMD's MI300x, and that they expect the gap could "expand further" with Nvidia's Rubin and Blackwell lines. Nvidia's GPU "outperformed AMD by a wide margin" across most of the analysts' tests. Despite AMD's product having some advertised advantages like higher memory bandwidth, they "do not result in superior real-world performance," the analysts wrote. They also said "expectations of mounting competition" from Intel (INTC) contributed to the downgrade, as they believe Intel could have "fairly competitive chips" by next year under its new CEO.

Title: Here are the chips that Nvidia can sell to China

After the U.S. placed chip-export controls on China in October 2022 to curb the country’s technological advances, U.S.-based chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) designed less-powerful versions of its artificial intelligence chips to continue its presence in the Chinese market while complying with the rules. Nvidia’s most advanced A100 and H100 chips were blocked under the restrictions, leading it to develop the reduced-capability A800 and H800 chips. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used the H800s to train and develop its AI models that rattled Silicon Valley and Wall Street earlier this year. However, under updated chip-export controls introduced in October 2023, those graphics processing units, or GPUs, were also banned, prompting the company to develop three more compliant chips. Now, concerns are mounting over whether Nvidia will be able to sell these specially-designed chips for much longer, as trade tensions between the U.S. and China rise. China and Hong Kong are the chipmaker’s fourth-largest market, representing about 13% of its annual revenue — or $17.1 billion — for fiscal year 2025, according to Nvidia’s Form 10-K. Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced new U.S. trade restrictions against dozens of Chinese tech firms, citing national security and foreign policy concerns — a continuation of the years long effort to maintain the U.S. lead in chips and AI. Here are three chips Nvidia can sell to China. To comply with the updated chip-export controls, Nvidia developed the H20, which is a modified version of its more powerful H100 GPUs that are used by major firms such as Google (GOOGL) and Meta (META). The H20 has become its most prominent chip in the Chinese market. The H20 has a reduced core count making it lower performing but still able to deliver AI capabilities. This week, H3C — one of China’s largest server makers — warned that the country could face potential shortages of the H20, as demand has grown significantly since DeepSeek’s boom. The L20 is based on Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace architecture, and was built on the 5 nanometer process. The L20 is a modified version of the AD102 — Nvidia’s flagship GPU. The AD102 can support gaming and AI. The L2 is based on the Ada Lovelace architecture, and is a modified version of the AD104 GPU.

Title: CoreWeave (CRWV) IPO Turns Into An Epic Disaster As NVIDIA Forced To Step In With A $250 Million Anchor Investment

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. We warned in early March that CoreWeave's IPO, one of the most anticipated public flotation events of the year, faced a growing chorus of headwinds, including moderating GPU prices, data center excess capacity risks courtesy of Microsoft's recent retrenchment in this space, and sustainability concerns around CoreWeave's revenue trajectory. Well, all of these factors are now coming to a head just as the company is about to go public. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, CoreWeave is a cloud company that specializes in handling GPU-intensive AI workloads. Over the past few years, the company has carved out for itself a winning niche: it has created a unique partnership with NVIDIA to be among the first to offer access to NVIDIA's latest-gen GPUs at scale, all packaged within an infrastructure that has been optimized to handle AI workloads, replete with "sub-microsecond" network latency and an effective GPU lifecycle management system. Basically, CoreWeave rents out NVIDIA's latest GPUs, packaged with various bells and whistles designed to attract AI startups. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Originally, CoreWeave planned to raise at least $4 billion via an IPO that would value the company at $35 billion. Scoop: CoreWeave is planning to downsize its IPO and cut the price — I'm hearing closer to the $23B valuation it had in the private market a year ago than the ~$30B it wanted. — Liz Hoffman (@lizrhoffman) March 27, 2025 However, in what amounted to an inauspicious start to CoreWeave's IPO day, Semafor reported earlier today that the company was now targeting a $23 billion valuation. *COREWEAVE IS SAID PLANNING TO CUT IPO SIZE TO ABOUT $1.5B Was supposed to be $3BN. Couldn't fill half the orderbook. This is very bad for revenue roundtripping schemes https://t.co/adSrC6vqjy — zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 27, 2025 Then, reports emerged that CoreWeave could not manage to fill even half of its orderbook and that the company would now raise just $1.5 billion in its IPO instead of its targeted cash raise of $4 billion. This IPO is a total disaster: NVDA forced to step in and "anchor" the IPO with a $250MM order at $40 per CNBC Without NVDA, which already owns 5% of CRWV, IPO would bust https://t.co/GS9rPpneGb — zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 27, 2025 Next, CNBC is now reporting that the prevailing situation has compelled NVIDIA to step in with a $250 million investment to anchor CoreWeave's IPO at $40 per share. Of course, TD Cowen's latest note is likely to have played a role in souring the sentiment around CoreWeave's IPO. As a refresher, TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias recently leveraged his channel checks to note that Microsoft's data center lease cancelations are "more pervasive" than previously thought, prompting investors to question the sustainability of the ongoing AI-related CapEx. Specifically, Elias calculated that Microsoft appears to have walked away - via lease deferrals and outright cancelations - from over 2GW of data center capacity in the US and the EU over the past six months. While Elias concedes that Microsoft's decision not to support OpenAI's training workloads might have partially prompted this retrenchment, he goes on to declare that the prevailing paradigm "points to data center oversupply relative to its current demand forecast." Of course, do note that Google and Meta have stepped forward to reclaim some of Microsoft's recently freed data center capacity. Bear in mind that Microsoft was responsible for 62 percent of CoreWeave's revenue in 2024. And, the tech giant previously intended to spend over $10 billion on CoreWeave's services by 2030. Elsewhere, concerns continue to linger around CoreWeave's revenue and cash burn trajectory. The company burned $1.1 billion in cash in 2023, and a whopping $6 billion in 2024, courtesy of its gigantic CapEx to build out AI infrastructure. As of the end of 2024, CoreWeave housed over 250,000 GPUs from NVIDIA across its 32 data centers, with the Hopper architecture constituting the vast majority of these GPUs. Due to its relentless cash needs, CoreWeave has raised $14.5 billion in financing via 12 funding rounds. It currently has a debt load of around $11 billion. Critically, most of CoreWeave's debt stock is secured against its gigantic stash of NVIDIA GPUs. However, with an hour of GPU compute trading at just $2 at the end of 2024 vs. the $8 per hour price tag earlier in the year, some remain concerned about the health of CoreWeave's GPU collateral. CoreWeave does have one thing going for it: consider the fact that its 2024 revenue increased by 737 percent year-over-year to $1.92 billion from just $229 million in revenue that it recorded in 2023. Nonetheless, the company has yet to show a profit, having reported a net loss of $863 million in 2024, and $594 million in 2023. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Apple might up its AI game with a $1 billion order of Nvidia servers, analyst says

Apple (AAPL-2.46%) has traditionally not been a big player in artificial intelligence model training or server infrastructure. But that might change pretty soon. “Apple is officially in the large server cluster Gen AI game... and Super Micro Computer (SMCI-1.79%) & Dell (DELL-5.14%) are the key server partners,” Loop Capital Markets analyst Ananda Baruah said in an analyst note on Monday. Large server clusters are big groups of high-powered servers used to train and run complex AI models, like those used in generative AI. The tech giant is reportedly placing roughly $1 billion worth of orders of Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.50%) GB300 NVL72 server platform, including the company’s next-generation Blackwell Ultra chips, built by Super Micro and Dell. With each server costing around $3.7 million to $4 million, Baruah estimates that Apple is buying approximately 250 servers. Apple didn’t immediately respond to Quartz’s request for comment. Baruah expects Apple to use these servers to run or train generative AI large language models. The move could have stemmed from the intense backlash Apple received in response to its decision to delay a much-anticipated generative AI upgrade of its voice assistant Siri. Apple began working on integrating advanced AI technology into its products as part of its Apple Intelligence initiative, which the company introduced last June at its annual developer conference, WWDC. The tech giant first teased a so-called “LLM Siri” based on advanced large language models last year, in an effort to scale its generative AI capabilities and catch up to industry rivals like OpenAI and Amazon. Although an arrival date was never publicly set, LLM Siri was widely anticipated to come in an iOS 18.4 upgrade expected next month. Now, the AI-infused Siri will likely be unveiled next year. Apple pulled its previous ads featuring the capability. The decision to delay LLM Siri’s rollout faced intense investor and consumer backlash, and the company was hit with a federal lawsuit last week. The suit demands unspecified financial damages on behalf of those who purchased new products in anticipation of the generative AI upgrade. “Apple’s advertisements saturated the internet, television, and other airwaves to cultivate a clear and reasonable consumer expectation that these transformative features would be available upon the iPhone’s release,” the lawsuit said. Loop Capital analysts’ initial work suggests that the LLM Siri debacle could partly be due to Apple’s preference to use traditional AI and machine learning, rather than more advanced generative AI. But Apple’s alleged purchase of these servers could signal a shift in preference towards the latter, Baruah said.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA-1.50%) were down by around 6% during mid-day trading on Wednesday after a report that its business in China could be negatively impacted by new government rules. The stock traded around $113.48 as of 3:20 p.m. New York Time. China’s National Development and Reform Commission has asked firms in the country to use energy-efficient chips in new data centers and those that are being expanded, the Financial Times reported, citing documents reviewed by the publication. The H20 chip, which was developed by Nvidia to comply with U.S. export controls, reportedly does not meet the new requirements introduced by the economic planning agency. Nvidia executives are reportedly seeking a meeting with Zheng Shanjie, the chair of the commission, to discuss the rules. It has also reportedly adjusted the chip to meet the energy efficiency rules. People told the Financial Times that companies such as Alibaba (BABA-2.62%) and Tencent (TCEHY-2.29%) have been advised by the commission to not buy the less-powerful Nvidia processors. However, the people said that H20 sales are not currently being impacted, because the rules have yet to be strictly enforced. Meanwhile, Chinese tech giants have reportedly increased orders for the H20 chips after Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the industry with its R1 reasoning models in January. China and Hong Kong are the chipmaker’s fourth-largest market, representing about 13% of its annual revenue — or $17.1 billion — for fiscal 2025, according to Nvidia’s Form 10-K. “Our products provide superb energy efficiency and value in every market we serve,” Nvidia said in a statement to the Financial Times. “As technology moves rapidly, export control policy should be adjusted to allow U.S. firms to offer the most energy-efficient products possible, while still achieving the Administration’s national security goals.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

AI hyperscaler's IPO could raise $2.5 billion, but Jeffrey Emanuel says it's a turkey When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Towards the end of January 2025, Jeffrey Emanuel, Founder and CEO of Pastel Network, wrote an interesting and insightful essay about Nvidia. More specifically, he discussed what he saw as its overvaluation and the threat it faced from a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek. noting, “history shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits,” and that, “Nvidia faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies.” That article, which went viral, helped cause the largest-ever single-day drop in the stock market, wiping $2 trillion off global markets and slashing Nvidia’s market capitalization by $600 billion. The latest target of Emanuel’s observations is Roseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave, which offers cloud infrastructure optimized for Nvidia GPUs and is expected to go public in the coming weeks in what will be a closely watched IPO. In his takedown of the company, Emanuel described it as the “WeWork of AI,” referring to the infamous flexible office space startup that was once valued at $47 billion but overexpanded, mismanaged funds, and collapsed after a failed IPO. As Emanuel wrote two weeks ago, “If it [CoreWeave] really IPOs for $30b+ then it’s a much better short than NVDA ever was. They have absolutely no durable moat and will soon be structurally disadvantaged on the cost curve for inference for specific LLM models versus hyperscalers like AWS, which have their own proprietary silicon (because clearly CoreWeave doesn’t know the first thing about making custom silicon, and won’t anytime soon).” MarketWatch picked up on this and cautioned investors. The site wrote, “CoreWeave set an estimated price range of $47 to $55 a share for its initial public offering, and an offering size of 49 million shares. Based on the midpoint of the estimated range, CoreWeave’s IPO would raise $2.5 billion for the company. That would make its IPO the fourth since 2022 to raise at least $2.5 billion, after Lineage, Arm Holdings, and Kenvue, according to Renaissance Capital.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “CoreWeave would have a market cap of about $25 billion based on the midpoint of the estimated pricing range,” the site added. While that’s far less than the $35 billion many market watchers have been predicting, Emanuel says, “that’s still at least $20b too high for this turkey!” Thanks to Steve Gelsi at @MarketWatch for helping me warn investors about the CoreWeave IPO. Luckily, they've already had to reduce the valuation by $10b from the initial price talk of $35b, but that's still at least $20b too high for this turkey! https://t.co/fnJorj87NkMarch 20, 2025 Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

U.S. stocks were mixed on Wednesday after data showed core durable goods orders contracted in February. The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell about 0.9% as of 10 a.m. EDT, the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added about 129 points. Tesla (TSLA-3.99%) and Nvidia (NVDA-1.50%) fell by 3.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Economic indicators are in focus this week, amid concerns that the U.S. economy is softening. On Tuesday, the Consumer Confidence Index’s expectation gauge hit a 12-year-low reading of 65.2 — below 80 is considered a recession signal. On Wednesday, fresh numbers showed core durable goods orders, which exclude aircraft and defense equipment, fell 0.3% in February from January, when they’d increased 0.2%. Companies may be delaying some investment due to uncertainties over economic growth and trade. Federal Reserve speakers today include Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari and St. Louis chief Alberto Musalem. Stocks to watch today: Chewy’s (CHWY-1.47%) stock fell 0.5%. The online pet supplies retailer’s earnings per share and sales topped estimates. CEO Sumit Singh cited “strong active customer growth” for the results and said momentum remains good, according to the company’s earnings statement. Dollar Tree’s (DLTR-5.60%) stock gained 4.2% after the discount retailer said it will sell its Family Dollar business unit to Brigade Capital and Macellum Capital for about $1 billion. Fourth-quarter same-store sales gained 2% year on year and the chain opened 33 new Dollar Tree stores. EPS fell 24% year on year. GameStop (GME-1.18%) surged 12% after it amended its investment policy to include Bitcoin. The company’s fiscal fourth-quarter sales plunged 24% from a year earlier but its profit topped expectations. Nintendo’s (NTDOY-1.59%) ADRs gained 4.4%, following the Japanese stock higher, after Bloomberg reported that Goldman Sachs had reinstated coverage of the video-game company and said it expects the release of the Switch 2 console on April 2 will attract a record number of active users.

The stock rally faltered on Tuesday as U.S. consumers turned their gloomiest in over a decade and as uncertainty persisted over plans for the next round of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, set to be unveiled on April 2. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both closed slightly higher after fluctuating, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding just 4.18 points. Nvidia (NVDA-1.50%) stock fell 0.6%, while Tesla (TSLA-3.99%) eked out a 3.5% gain even after its European unit sales and market share dropped again last month. GameStop (GME-1.18%) jumped more than 5% in postmarket trading after it amended its investment policy to include Bitcoin. The company’s fiscal-fourth quarter earnings also topped expectations. Consumer confidence cratered in March, with the index’s future expectations gauge plunging 9.6 points to 65.2, the lowest reading in 12 years. A reading of 80 or below is a recession signal, according to the the Conference Board, which conducts the survey. The headline number also fell by more than expected, and new-home sales data also fell short of estimates. The drop in the consumer confidence “index shows the new administration’s plans for tariffs and spending cuts are going down like a lead balloon with households,” Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Sam Tombs said. Stocks of consumption-related companies including UPS (UPS-1.01%), Dollar Tree (DLTR-5.60%) and Target (TGT-2.75%) declined on Tuesday. Dollar Tree reports earnings before the market opens on Wednesday morning. Markets rose Monday after Trump said reciprocal duties may stop short of his pledge to equalize with levels charged by foreign countries on U.S. goods. The administration may also delay duties on particular types of products. The tariffs are still set to give the market a negative surprise, Goldman Sachs (GS-3.22%) economist Alec Phillips wrote in a note to clients. Trump administration officials have said initial duties are meant as a basis for talks — which incentivizes them to set high rates, Phillips said. A recent survey shows market participants expect an initial 9 percent reciprocal tariff rate, but it may be double that level, he wrote. And despite the lowered pitch of Trump’s rhetoric, the new duties are likely to cover almost all of U.S. trade, Phillips said. The president’s plans to add extra tariffs on buyers of Venezuelan oil add complications, as do the possible inclusion of value added taxes (VATs) and currency undervaluations in the calculations. Stocks active Tuesday included Trump Media, which jumped 8.9% after it announced a tie-up with Crypto.com to start exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial said it plans to issue a stablecoin. Boeing’s (BA-3.01%) stock gained 0.9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the planemaker is seeking to withdraw its earlier agreement to plead guilty in a criminal case that alleged it deceived regulators before two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX jets. It was a bad day for Chinese EV makers, with Xiaomi (XIACF-3.21%) falling o.7% in U.S. trading after saying it sold 800 million new shares for about $5.5 billion to fund its expansion plans. BYD (BYDDY-2.35%) was unable to sustain Monday’s post-earnings gains, with its ADRs dropping 5.2%. Decliners also included 23andMe (ME-16.57%), which fell 11%, adding to Monday’s 59% plunge following its bankruptcy filing. Carvana (CVNA-0.93%) jumped 3.8% after Morgan Stanley (MS-3.41%) analyst Adam Jonas increased his recommendation on the stock to buy from hold and bumped his price target to $280 from $260, Barron’s reported. Mobileye Global (MBLY-5.17%) gained 8.7% after it announced a tie-up with Volkswagen (VWAGY-2.65%) on automated-driving technology.

Title: Nvidia’s A.I. ‘Super Bowl’ Is an Economic Boon for San Jose

During the early days of Nvidia (NVDA)’s annual developer conference, the San Jose, Calif., event was more akin to a science fair. In 2024, the increasingly popular gathering was dubbed the “Woodstock of A.I.” This year, with a record-breaking 28,000 attendees, GTC 2025 was upgraded to the new technology’s “Super Bowl.” Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. In recent years, the Jensen Huang-helmed chipmaker has become the undisputed darling of the A.I. world, with demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) boosting its market cap to a staggering $2.93 trillion. But nowhere else is Nvidia’s soaring success more evident than in San Jose’s downtown district, where Nvidia’s GTC conference has become so popular that Huang had to deliver his annual keynote address from a jam-packed hockey arena this year. Compared to GTC 2024, Nvidia’s newest iteration of its developer conference “literally almost doubled in size,” Alex Stettinski, CEO of the San Jose Downtown Association, told Observer. Foot traffic at the San Jose Convention Center, which serves as GTC’s primary venue, rose from around 19,000 last year to roughly 26,000, according to Stettinski, who noted that event correlated to some 13,000 downtown dining visits—a more than 130 percent increase year-over-year. It’s too early to gauge the total economic impact that the conference, which was held between March 17 and 2021, had on San Jose this year. However, given the increase in attendees and restaurant activity, it will surpass last year’s figure of $15.5 million, representing the city’s largest conference since the Covid-19 pandemic. “I would say, anecdotally, that the number probably is substantially higher,” said Stettinski. Around 1,500 attendees came to Nvidia’s first-ever GTC conference in 2009, which took place in the poster-lined hallways of San Jose’s Fairmont Hotel and served as a gathering for engineers and scientists eager to discuss the world of GPUs. Nowadays, however, GTC has become one of the tech world’s most closely-watched events, one scrutinized by analysts and attended by industry leaders like Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder of DreamWorks; Michael Dell (DELL), CEO of Dell; and Yann LeCun, Meta (META)’s chief A.I. scientist. It’s also an increasingly incorporated spectacle. During Huang’s keynote on March 18, the chief executive didn’t just discuss his company’s upcoming A.I. chips—he also fired Nvidia merch into the crowd with the help of T-shirt cannons. Attendees wandering San Jose’s downtown, which was awash in Nvidia’s signature colors of green and black, were also treated to a litany of activations that included a Taiwanese-style night market complete with 20 vendors. To accommodate its growing size, Nvidia GTC expanded from two downtown locations to seven this year, said Stettinski, with the chipmaker temporarily taking over areas such as Cesar Chavez Park or the Tech Interactive museum. In some ways, GTC 2025 was a rehearsal for San Jose’s ability to handle major upcoming events like the 2026 Super Bowl and World Cup. “It was a little bit of a test run to see what we can do,” said Stettinski, who noted that the response from locals has been largely positive. “The only complaint that I heard once in a while is, ‘Man, I can’t get a dinner table.'” Whether or not Nvidia’s GTC will become too big for San Jose remains to be seen. While the chipmaker hasn’t yet confirmed that the event will return to the Northern California hub next year, Stettinski said the city “will do anything we can” to bring Nvidia back in 2026. Huang, for his part, seems set on staying put. “The only way to hold more people at GTC is we’re going to have to grow San Jose,” remarked the executive during his keynote. “And we’re working on it.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: The Trump administration is being asked to relax some AI chip rules

As the U.S. prepares to roll out rules that will affect global artificial intelligence development, foreign government officials and tech company leaders are asking the Trump administration to relax some rules around chips, according to Bloomberg. The Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, which was unveiled at the tail end of the Biden administration, aims to control which countries, including U.S. allies, can import advanced semiconductors needed for AI development. Known as the AI diffusion rule, the framework puts countries into three different tiers, and it outlines how many chips countries can import, where the chips can be deployed, and how nations can work together on AI. With the May 15 deadline to be in compliance looming, foreign governments and tech companies are asking the Trump administration to rethink some restrictions out of worries that the rules could hamper AI development and investment, Bloomberg reported. Poland, for example, is reportedly concerned that data center investments from Google (GOOGL-5.03%) and Microsoft (MSFT-3.37%) could be negatively affected by computing caps. Indian officials, meanwhile, met with former president Joe Biden’s national security council in January to discuss how it can access AI chips, people told Bloomberg. Oracle (ORCL-3.81%) and Nvidia (NVDA-1.50%), which both conduct business in countries under tougher restrictions from the rule (such as those in Southeast Asia), have both asked the Trump administration to scrap the current rule and draft regulations, Bloomberg reported. In January, Nvidia pushed back at the proposed rules in a blog post. “While cloaked in the guise of an ‘anti-China’ measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,” Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement. “The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware. Rather than mitigate any threat, the new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead.” At the moment, White House officials are debating how to implement the rule. Some officials have proposed getting rid of the tiered system and caps on computing power in favor of leaning more on export licenses for a majority of countries, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Title: Nvidia's latest innovation started as an April Fools' joke 8 years ago

It’s an April Fools’ Day miracle. On Tuesday, Nvidia (NVDA-1.50%) unveiled its experimental version of Project G-Assist, an AI assistant for gamers and gaming content creators that the company first teased as a joke on X (then Twitter) on April Fools’ Day in 2017. Nvidia demoed the feature at computer and technology trade show Computex Taipei last year. The AI assistant will be available via the NVIDIA app to desktop users of the company’s visual computing platform GeForce RTX; laptop support will come in a future update. While the assistant can’t do everything advertised in the April Fools’ prank eight years ago (it certainly can’t tell you when your drinks have been optimally chilled in the fridge), it does help PC gamers control and optimize a wide variety of PC settings via simple voice or text commands. The assistant can provide real-time diagnostics and recommendations to improve power efficiency or optimize game settings. It can also control peripheral settings such as keyboard colors, fan speeds, and the lighting in your room on supported devices. And for content creators who film themselves gaming, the assistant makes it easier to record their screen. The model uses a small language model (SLM), so this assistant isn’t supposed to be a broad, conversational AI, Nvidia said in a press release. But AI developers can leverage and extend the assistant’s capabilities through the use of plug-ins. For example, users can add a Spotify (SPOT-3.81%) plug-in to enable music and volume control via voice command while gaming, or they can add Google’s (GOOGL-5.03%) Gemini plug-in to bring more complex conversations and web searches that can help users get live advice on gameplay.

Title: Dow jumps 598 points as Trump eases off on tariff plans

Stocks surged on Monday as Donald Trump said he may scale back tariffs set to be unveiled on April. 2. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 2.3%, as all Magnificent 7 stocks surged, the S&P 500 gained 1.8%, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.4%, or almost 600 points. The reciprocal tariffs may stop short of his pledge to equalize with levels charged by foreign countries on U.S. goods, the president told reporters, according to the Wall Street Journal. The administration may also delay duties on particular lines of goods, including autos, lumber, drugs and chips. This apparent moderation came even as Trump announced a 25% additional tariff on all countries that import oil from Venezuela. China is the biggest foreign buyer of Venezuelan oil. India, Cuba and several European countries are also customers. Big tech was a big beneficiary of Monday’s rally, with Tesla (TSLA-3.99%) stock adding almost 12%, cutting its year-to-date decline to about 27%. The increases for the rest of the Mag 7 shares were 3.7% for Meta (META-4.31%), 3.6% for Amazon (AMZN-4.48%), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA-1.50%), 2.2% for Google (GOOGL-5.03%), 1.1% for Apple (AAPL-2.46%), and 0.5% for Microsoft (MSFT-3.37%). BYD’s (BYDDY-2.35%) stock jumped almost 5.4% in New York after the Chinese electric vehicle maker’s 2024 earnings topped expectations, overtaking Tesla in revenue. Its revenue jumped 29% from 2023 to 777 billion yuan ($107 billion), compared with $97.7 billion for its chief U.S. rival. Tesla still leads in profit, however, at $7.1 billion, compared with its rival’s $5.6 billion. BYD’s profit gained 34% year-over-year, topping the StreetAccount consensus estimate, with its net margin widening to 5.2% from 5.0%. Crypto stocks also got buoyed by the shift into riskier assets, also reflected in increased token prices. MicroStrategy (MSTR-10.54%) surged 10% after saying it’d boosted its bitcoin holdings to more than 500,000. Coinbase (COIN-8.09%), Robinhood (HOOD-5.55%) and Hut 8 (HUT-6.18%) all also advanced. Not all the news was good today: Manufacturing shrank again this month, after a brief reprieve in January and February, according to the flash manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for March. The entire economy is probably slowing, Citi (C-2.41%) economists wrote. —With reporting by William Gavin, Britney Nguyen, and Harri Weber Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Tesla Stock Soars on Driving-Assistance Plans in China

Major U.S. equities indexes popped higher following reports that President Donald Trump could limit the scope of the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on April 2. Monday's upbeat market session marked the beginning of a new trading week. Several important economic data points, including updates on consumer sentiment, the housing market, and inflation, are expected to be released. The S&P 500 gained 1.8%, while the Dow added 1.4%. A resurgence among tech stocks helped lift the Nasdaq, which closed 2.3% higher. Tesla (TSLA) shares surged 11.9%, logging the S&P 500's top daily performance. The march higher on Monday extended gains posted late last week after Tesla CEO Elon Musk held an all-hands meeting with employees, arguing that investors have underestimated the potential of the firm's self-driving and humanoid robot technology. Tesla also announced it would activate its smart driving-assistance feature in China as soon as it receives regulatory approval. United Airlines (UAL) increased annual fees for its rewards credit cards and airport lounge memberships. While customers will have to pay more for these travel perks, United also announced sign-up bonuses for new co-branded credit cards with JPMorgan Chase, along with additional benefits for cardholders, such as credits for ridesharing services. The carrier stressed that the enhanced benefits should outweigh the cost increase, and United Airlines shares soared 7.2%. Semiconductor stocks got a boost from the developments on trade policy, with suggestions that chips could receive a reprieve in the upcoming round of reciprocal tariffs. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained 7.0% after China's Ant Group said it had developed a more cost-efficient technique for training artificial intelligence (AI) models. Although Ant has used AI chips from Nvidia (NVDA) in the development process, it is reportedly considering alternatives from AMD and Chinese rivals. While the alleviation of tariff concerns helped lift high-risk, high-reward investments like tech stocks, shares of companies known for their more defensive characteristics came under pressure. Shares of Hormel Foods (HRL), the parent company of Spam and other packaged food brands, fell 2.4%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock. Hormel announced last week that former CEO Jeff Ettinger would rejoin its board of directors and participate in the committee tasked with naming a replacement for current CEO Jim Snee, who is set to retire later this year. Shares of MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), operator of a digital trading platform for fixed-income securities, moved 2.4% lower. Monday's downturn reversed some of the gains posted by the stock this month after MarketAxess reported robust growth in average daily volume for February. While strength in emerging markets and Eurobonds contributed to the positive monthly trading figures, the platform experienced softness in U.S. credit markets. Brown-Forman (BF.B) stock also slipped 2.3%. Shares of the alcoholic beverage maker have been trending downward over the past two weeks as tensions between the U.S. and major trade partners shine a spotlight on whiskey and other spirits. However, recent reports that the European Union might delay its impending tariff on U.S. whiskey could spell some relief for the Jack Daniels parent.

Magnificent 7 stocks rose during Monday morning trading after reports that the Trump administration is considering excluding some tariffs that are set to go into place on April 2. Microsoft (MSFT-3.37%) and Apple (AAPL-2.46%) stocks were up by less than 1%, while Alphabet (GOOGL-5.03%) rose by 1.2% at the market open. Amazon (AMZN-4.48%) and Nvidia (NVDA-1.50%) were up by more than 2% during early morning trading, while Meta (META-4.31%) rose by close to 4%, and Tesla (TSLA-3.99%) climbed by more than 5%. Tesla stock was up by more than 4% before the market open on Monday, while shares of Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon were up by more than 2% during pre-market trading. Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all up by more than 1%. S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all gained in pre-market trading after Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that the White House is narrowing its focus for reciprocal tariffs that President Donald Trump will announce on April 2. The Trump administration will exclude some of the reciprocal tariffs it plans to put on other countries, including U.S. allies, on April 2, Bloomberg reported, citing officials familiar with the matter. Additionally, Trump will reportedly not announce the separate, industry-specific tariffs that he has previously spoken about. Countries without tariffs on the U.S. or that have a trade surplus with the U.S. will not be targeted by the reciprocal tariffs, an official told Bloomberg. However, President Trump reportedly wants to announce rates that are effective immediately. “April 2nd is going to be liberation day for America,” Trump reportedly said on Friday. “We’ve been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe.” He added that the tariffs will bring the U.S. “tens of billions.” Despite a more targeted approach, the tariffs will still largely impact major U.S. import partners, the Wall Street Journal reported. The White House reportedly now is focused on implementing tariffs on about 15% of nations with which the U.S. has an ongoing trade imbalance.

To test his theory, Kendrick created a hypothetical "Mag 7B" index, a spin on the Magnificent 7 index, that replaces Tesla with Bitcoin. Normally, the Mag 7 refers to tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. And traders who had done so in 2017 would be up 5% now, he concluded. If you add Bitcoin to the mix, its $1.7 trillion market capitalization makes it the sixth largest among the group. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has been retracing slightly after getting close to retaking $88,000. BTC has gained 3.7% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. There's more evidence that traders are feeling less uncertain. Open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has swelled by more than 10% in the past day, according to CoinGlass data. There are currently $57 billion worth of open Bitcoin derivatives contracts. Earlier this month, when markets were acutely feeling the effects of President Donald Trump's tariff troubles, that figure had dropped as low as $45 billion. But now that macroeconomic jitters have eased, traders seem more comfortable buying back into BTC. If BTC had been swapped into the altered Mag7 index—starting in 2017, when Bitcoin had just hit what was then an all-time high—it would have outperformed the Mag 7 by about 5%, Kendrick writes. In addition, traders who swapped Bitcoin for TSLA over the past seven years would have seen fewer price fluctuations, as well. "Perhaps more importantly than returns is Mag 7B’s lower volatility relative to Mag 7 in every year," he added. "Over the full period, average annualized volatility is almost 2% lower for Mag 7B than for Mag 7." Stock correlations have been a hotly contested topic among Bitcoin investors. In the last quarter of 2024, BTC appeared to break away from gold and equities completely and outperformed "every asset class," NYDIG noted. "Furthermore, during the period since President Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, BTC has traded like most of the Mag 7 stocks," Kendrick wrote. "If we compare price declines against [volume] levels over this period, BTC trades in a similar vol-adjusted fashion to NVDA, while TSLA trades a lot like ETH."

Stocks extended gains as an economic indicator — the March flash Purchasing Mangers Index (PMI) — improved by more than expected. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had all gained at the open following reports that the Trump administration may take a more-targeted approach than initially planned on tariffs it’s set to roll out on April 2. The White House will probably omit industry-specific tariffs but apply reciprocal levies on nations that account for the bulk of trade with the U.S., the Wall Street Journal (NWSA-1.24%) said, citing an unidentified Trump administration official. With investors uncertain about what will materialize from Donald Trump’s plans — especially over trade — economic indicators are set to be in focus this week. The preliminary composite purchasing manager index (PMI) for March rose to 53.5 — consensus had been for 51.7 — from 51.6 in February, driven by an unexpected jump in the services reading to 54.3 from 51.0. The manufacturing measure worsened by more than expected to 49.8. Any number below 50 indicates a contraction. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called a snap election for April 28 over the weekend. His ruling Liberal party is leading in some polls. The ShopTalk Conference starts in Las Vegas on Monday and runs through Thursday. It will focus on the future of retail and e-commerce.

The chemical company was ordered by a Georgia jury to pay about $2.1 billion to a plaintiff who claimed its Roundup weedkiller caused cancer, Bloomberg reported. The company said it plans to appeal the verdict. The company has won 17 out of the last 25 trials over the issue. James Hardie (JHX-1.77%) stock fell 16% after unveiling an agreement on Sunday to buy AZEK (AZEK-0.18%) for a total of $8.75 billion, including debt. AZEK investors will receive $26.45 in cash and 1.0340 James Hardie shares for each of their shares. AZEK surged 18%. Both companies make construction materials. MicroStrategy’s (MSTR-10.54%) stock jumped 5.6% after the tech company said it now owns 506,137 Bitcoins.
