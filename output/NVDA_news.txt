Title: Here’s why Trump killing the ‘AI diffusion rule’ is a win for chipmakers

The U.S. government plans to withdraw a rule introduced under the Biden administration that had aimed to restrict exports of advanced AI chips — a policy that had posed challenges for major semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD). “The Biden AI rule is overly complex, overly bureaucratic and would stymie American innovation,” a spokeswoman from the Commerce Department said in a statement. The Trump administration intends to issue a revised version of the rule, which was set to come into effect on May 15. This process could take months to finalize, sources told Axios. The regulation in question — titled the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion — would have limited exports of AI chips to over 100 countries. These restrictions aimed to prevent countries from bypassing U.S. export controls, particularly in relation to China. Chipmakers had criticized the rules, however. They argued it would give an advantage to Chinese competitors, such as Huawei, as they develop and sell their own AI hardware, foregoing an opportunity to ensure that much of the world would rely on American technology. The rule would have affected Nvidia’s ability to sell its high-demand graphics processing units, or GPUs, in markets such as India, Mexico, Singapore, and Switzerland. The shift could reflect a relaxing stance toward regulating AI, offering a momentary boon for chipmakers. Since Bloomberg first reported the reversal on Wednesday, Nvidia and AMD stocks have gained 4.4% and 3.4%, respectively. But any respite could prove temporary, and obstacles persist when it comes to accessing the crucial Chinese market. Nvidia’s most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100, are already banned from export to China, as a result of Biden-era restrictions. Last month the Trump administration also introduced new license requirements for less powerful chips by Nvidia and AMD in order to comply with export controls. Nvidia said these requirements on its H20 chips had resulted in a $5.5 billion hit to its quarterly earnings, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company’s earnings are scheduled to be released May 28. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Arm Holdings (ARM) delivered an outlook that came in below analysts' expectations, sending shares lower in extended trading Wednesday. The chip designer and Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it anticipates fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 30 cents to 38 cents, short of the 41 cents called for by Wall Street, according to Visible Alpha. Arm's revenue forecast, of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, was also lower than the analyst consensus at the midpoint of its range. Arm shares fell some 9% in after-hours trading. The stock is up less than 1% so far in 2025 through Wednesday’s close. In its fiscal fourth quarter, Arm posted record revenue of $1.24 billion, up 34% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Adjusted net income was $584 million, or 55 cents per share, compared to $376 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier, surpassing Wall Street’s estimates. Arm's royalty revenue improved 18% to a record $607 million, while its license and other revenue gained 53% to $634 million.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Entrepreneur Grant Cardone is celebrating what he calls the beginning of America’s biggest comeback ever, thanks to President Donald Trump’s push to bring tech manufacturing back to the U.S. Cardone posted on X after Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday to announce a massive new chip investment. “America is about to have its greatest resurgence in its 250 year history. Thank you President Trump for ‘encouraging' big tech to come home,” Cardone wrote, sharing a video of Huang’s remarks.

EarnOS Proprietary earning software turns smartphones into EarnPhones. During the event, Trump introduced Huang as “the founder, CEO and president of NVIDIA,” and said he was producing up to $500 billion worth of the most powerful AI chips over the next four years—all to be manufactured in the U.S. for the first time ever. Huang said, “NVIDIA reinvented computing for the first time after 60 years,” noting that modern computer design hasn’t changed much since IBM’s System/360 in the 1960s. But the new AI chips are a big leap forward. “That GPU—that’s one GPU unit—it’s 70 pounds, 60,000 parts, 10,000 watts,” Huang said. “Just to test a superchip requires a supercomputer.” Trending: Donald Trump just announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal — here's how you can invest in the entertainment market's next big disruptor at $2.25 per share. Huang credited Trump for pushing manufacturing to happen in the U.S. “Without the president’s leadership, his policies, his support, and very importantly, his strong encouragement … manufacturing in the United States wouldn’t have accelerated to this pace,” he said. He emphasized that making these chips isn’t about cheap labor—it’s about advanced tech, robotics, and AI. Nvidia will also use its Omniverse digital twin technology to help build cutting-edge factories on U.S. soil. “This new industry is a manufacturing industry in itself,” Huang said. “We now have the backing of the administration, the backing of President Trump, to support the creation of a whole new industry.” See Also: Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary called Missing Ring his biggest mistake — Don't repeat history—invest in RYSE at just $1.90/share. Huang said the AI infrastructure being built in the U.S. will power breakthroughs in healthcare, financial services, drug discovery, education, and more. “This computer is the engine of a whole new industry,” he said. “Electricity goes into this machine and incredible tokens come out—artificial intelligence.” Nvidia’s partnership with the Trump administration may be shaping up to be a key turning point in bringing high-tech manufacturing back to the U.S., and Cardone believes it could mark the beginning of a historic economic transformation.

Title: Supermicro Stock Drops as Server Maker Lowers Its Revenue Outlook

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) cut its full-year revenue outlook, sending shares lower in extended trading Tuesday. The server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner said it now expects fiscal 2025 revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.6 billion, down from its prior range of $23.5 billion to $25 billion. Supermicro shares fell over 6% in after-hours trading following the release. For the fiscal third quarter, Supermicro posted revenue of $4.6 billion, up nearly 20% year-over-year and at the high end of its significantly reduced forecast. Adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share fell from 66 cents per share a year earlier. Supermicro said it anticipates fourth-quarter sales of $5.6 billion to $6.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 40 cents to 50 cents. CEO Charles Liang said some Supermicro clients delayed making product decisions during the period, which pushed sales beyond the fiscal third quarter. “We do expect many of those commitments to land in the June and September quarters, reinforcing my confidence in our ability to meet our long-term targets, however economic uncertainty and tariff impacts may have a short-term impact,” Liang said. Supermicro shares have seen significant volatility this year as concerns about the company's accounting practices and delayed filings raised worries it could be delisted from the Nasdaq. The company ultimately met the exchange’s deadline to file its delayed reports in February, but still faces challenges, including uncertainty around how it could be affected by shifting tariff policies.

Time Published: 2025-05-06T19:03:48Z
Full Content:
If you’ve been researching investment options for building long-term wealth, chances are you’ve come across the term “VTSAX.” It’s one of the most recommended mutual funds among financial experts and personal finance communities. But what exactly is VTSAX, how does it work, and is it the right investment for you? In this comprehensive guide, we break down everything you need to know about VTSAX in simple terms. Whether you’re a beginner or just looking to understand this fund better, this article is designed to help you make an informed investment decision. Contents VTSAX stands for Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares. It is a low-cost mutual fund offered by Vanguard, one of the largest investment companies in the world. VTSAX is designed to give investors exposure to the entire U.S. stock market in a single investment. This means that when you invest in VTSAX, you own a tiny piece of over 4,000 publicly traded U.S. companies – from large corporations like Apple and Microsoft to small-cap stocks you’ve probably never heard of. The popularity of VTSAX boils down to a few key benefits: VTSAX uses a passive investing strategy. It aims to mirror the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, which includes nearly all U.S. stocks across various sectors and market capitalizations (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap). Instead of trying to beat the market like actively managed funds do, VTSAX simply tracks it. This strategy leads to lower trading costs, minimal turnover, and greater tax efficiency. VTSAX holds thousands of companies across a wide range of industries. Some of the top holdings include: These top holdings typically make up a larger percentage of the fund due to their market capitalization. Many investors compare VTSAX vs VTI because both offer exposure to the total U.S. stock market. The main differences are: Functionally, both are nearly identical in terms of holdings, performance, and expense ratio. VTSAX is ideal for: However, it may not be suitable for short-term traders or those looking for high-risk, high-reward investments. To invest in VTSAX, you typically need to: You can also set up automatic investments and dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP) for VTSAX. One of the biggest advantages of VTSAX is its low expense ratio of 0.04%. That means you pay just $4 annually for every $10,000 invested. This low fee helps more of your money stay invested and grow over time. There are no load fees or commission fees when buying directly through Vanguard. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, VTSAX has historically performed in line with the overall U.S. stock market. Over the long term (10+ years), the average annual return has been approximately 7-10% depending on market conditions. During bull markets, VTSAX tends to rise steadily, and during bear markets, it will decline, but not as drastically as individual stocks. VTSAX pays quarterly dividends that can be reinvested or taken as cash. These dividends come from the profits of the companies in the fund and can provide passive income, especially over time as your investment grows. Dividend yield typically ranges from 1.2% to 2.0%, depending on market conditions. Like all investments, VTSAX carries some risk: Here’s how VTSAX compares to similar total market funds: VTSAX is one of the best all-in-one investment options available today. It combines simplicity, low costs, and broad diversification, making it an excellent choice for investors who want to grow wealth steadily over the long term. Whether you’re saving for retirement, building a nest egg, or just starting out, VTSAX offers a reliable path toward financial independence. If you’re looking for a single fund that provides exposure to the entire U.S. economy with minimal effort and fees, VTSAX is hard to beat. FAQs About VTSAX Is VTSAX good for beginners? Yes. VTSAX is one of the most beginner-friendly investments due to its simplicity and diversification. What account should I use to invest in VTSAX? Tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs, Traditional IRAs, or 401(k)s are ideal. Can I lose money with VTSAX? Yes, VTSAX is subject to market risks. However, the long-term trend of the stock market has historically been upward. How do I buy VTSAX if I don’t have $3,000?

For international exposure, consider adding VTIAX to your portfolio. Categorized in: Share Article: Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says San Francisco is so back — thanks to AI

Time Published: 2025-05-06T16:45:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said AI has revived a dying San Francisco that many thought wouldn’t recover from the pandemic. “It’s because of AI that San Francisco is back,” Huang said while speaking to Jacob Helberg, Trump’s undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, at The Hill & Valley Forum. “Anybody who lives in San Francisco, you’ll know what I’m talking about. Just about everybody evacuated San Francisco,” he said, “Now it’s thriving again. It’s all because of AI.” A 2024 article from The San Francisco Standard called AI companies San Francisco’s “most desired tenants.” It cited a JLL (JLL) report that found AI companies leased north of 1.7 million square feet of office space since 2022, when ChatGPT was released. Chris Pham, senior analyst at JLL, predicted a continued AI boom in the city, likening it to the invention of electricity, instead of just another new industry. In his remarks with Helberg, Huang acknowledged that as AI progresses, “new jobs will be created, some jobs will be lost, and every job will be changed.” “It’s not AI that’s going to take your job. It’s not AI that’s going to destroy your company,” he said, encouraging widespread adoption of the technology. “It’s the company and the person who uses AI that’s going to take your job. And so that’s something to internalize.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
