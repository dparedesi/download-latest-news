Apple is on a record-setting streak. Shares of Apple (AAPL) were up more than 3% in extended trading Thursday, topping their recent highs after the iPhone maker posted earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates and CEO Tim Cook gave an upbeat outlook for the holiday season. Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue that rose 8% year-over-year to $102.47 billion. Both figures came in ahead of analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, as Apple's services revenue climbed to a record high of $28.75 billion. Growth in Apple's iPhone sales also helped drive the better-than-expected results, after the company launched its iPhone 17 lineup in September. Sales of iPhones rose 6% to $49.03 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing the bulk of Apple's product revenue. The figure also represented a September quarter revenue record for the iPhone, with CEO Tim Cook suggesting that could mean a record holiday season ahead. "We expect December-quarter revenue to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for iPhone," Cook said on the company's earnings call Thursday, anticipating 10% to 12% revenue growth. Analysts were looking for 6%. Apple shares were up about 8% for 2025 through Thursday's close. This week's gains have boosted Apple's market capitalization above $4 trillion, making it the word's second-most-valuable company behind only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).

Apple (AAPL) is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell today, with Wall Street analysts looking for strong results on the top and bottom lines. After some signs of a strong start to early sales of the iPhone 17 lineup, bullish analysts at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley recently told clients their expectations around Apple's results have climbed, with that momentum likely to carry into an upbeat outlook for the current quarter and winter holiday season. More details around widely anticipated artificial intelligence features and potential plans for a foldable phone in 2026 could also drive more enthusiasm for Apple's stock, they said. Options pricing suggests traders expect Apple stock could move about 3% in either direction by the end of this week following the company's earnings call, which could drive the stock to a new record. This hasn't been an easy year for Apple, amid lingering concerns that its AI efforts have lagged those of many of its Big Tech peers. However, strong results today and comments around plans for fiscal 2026 could help lift investor sentiment. Apple shares have climbed about 8% in 2025 so far, lagging the S&P 500's nearly 17% gain, after spending some of the year in negative territory amid worries about its AI progress. Apple's gains have largely come in the last few months, after some signs of inroads with the Trump administration and easing trade policy headwinds, along with promising demand signals for the iPhone 17. The iPhone maker is seen reporting earnings of $1.77 per share on revenue of $101.61 billion, up from earnings per share of 97 cents on $94.93 billion in revenue a year ago, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. However, analysts are divided on whether the iPhone's stock still has room to rise from this week's all-time highs. The shares were up about 1% near $272 in recent trading, leaving it on track to close at a fresh high topping yesterday's record. This week's gains have boosted Apple's market capitalization above $4 trillion, trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) on the list of the world's most valuable companies.

Title: Alphabet Stock Hits Record High After Google Parent Reports Strong Earnings—Monitor These Key Levels

Alphabet (GOOGL) shares jumped to a record high Thursday after the Google parent reported earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, as quarterly revenue surpassed $100 billion for the first time. The tech giant’s top line received a boost in the third quarter from Google Cloud posting a 34% jump in revenue from a year earlier, as Alphabet customers invest billions expanding their AI infrastructure and data analytics capabilities. Meanwhile, revenue in the company’s legacy advertising business grew 13% in the period, signaling that the digital ad market remains stable amid economic uncertainty and increasing competition. The company also raised its capital expenditure spending forecast for the year to between $91 billion to $93 billion, citing booming AI demand. Alphabet shares were up nearly 5% at around $288 in recent trading and have now gained more than 50% since the start of 2025, making it the top-performing Magnificent Seven-member stock this year, slightly ahead of AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). Investors have cheered the company’s accelerating growth in AI and cloud, resilience in its advertising business, and an antitrust win that allowed it to retain its Chrome browser. Below, we take a closer look at Alphabet’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to identify major price levels worth watching out for. Alphabet shares broke out from a flag pattern earlier this month, indicating a continuation of the stock’s strong uptrend. It’s worth pointing out that while the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, the indicator sits in overbought territory, increasing the likelihood of near-term profit-taking or consolidation. Let’s use the measuring principle to forecast a potential upside target on Alphabet’s chart if the shares continue to rally and also identify two major support levels worth monitoring during possible downturns. Investors can forecast a bullish upside target by applying the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes a stock's prior moves to project its next potential advance. When applying the study to Alphabet’s chart, we calculate the distance in points of the strong trend higher that preceded the flag and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. In this case, we add $115 to $245, which forecasts a target of $360. During downturns, investors should initially monitor the $235 level. Traders who avoid chasing breakouts may wait for retracements to the base of the flag pattern, which also coincides with a wide-ranging day on the chart in early September. Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares revisit lower support around $205. This area on the chart, currently situated just above the rising 50-week moving average, may attract buying interest near the stock’s prominent January swing high.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Despite Broadcom climbing 13% in the last week, its competitor Nvidia might be a more attractive option. Regularly assessing alternatives is fundamental to a solid investment strategy. Nvidia (NVDA) stock displays better revenue growth over significant periods, greater profitability, and a relatively lower valuation compared to Broadcom (AVGO) stock, indicating that investing in NVDA may be advantageous. Nvidia’s vertically integrated platform, including its cutting-edge Blackwell GPUs, NVLink interconnects, and proprietary CUDA software stack make it indispensable for AI data centers needing massive parallel processing power. In comparison, Broadcom’s custom silicon (ASICs) and AI networking solutions serve specific client needs through long-term contracts, representing a potentially lower long term growth model. Quiz time: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed—the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer might surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework increases your chances of success. AVGO designs and provides semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, offering solutions such as set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking. NVDA delivers graphics, computing, and networking solutions for gaming, visualization, data centers, and automotive markets. Valuation & Performance Overview Note: For “Last 3 Year Return” metric, the preferred stock is the one with higher returns unless the returns are exceedingly high (>300%), which poses a risk of sell-off.

Title: Circular Investment Deals in AI Look Similar to the Dot-Com Bubble

Please buy my product, and I’ll use the money to buy yours. Flurry of Circular Deals The Wall Street Journal asks Is the Flurry of Circular AI Deals a Win-Win—or Sign of a Bubble? If this reminds you of circular investment in the dot-com era, it’s because it should. The Journal points out Lucent’s lending of billions of dollars to upstart telecom companies fueling Lucent’s growth. When the financing went bust the scheme crashed. Now, AMD is paying OpenAI to be a customer, albeit in a different way. The same is going on with Nvidia and OpenAI. But at least it’s not debt financed. Nvidia’s More Questions Than Answers Deal Reuters reports More Questions than Answers in Nvidia’s $100 Billion OpenAI Deal Nvidia’s (NVDA), move to invest up to $100 billion into OpenAI at the same time it plans to supply millions of its market-leading artificial intelligence chips to the ChatGPT creator has little precedent in the tech industry.Under the deal, Nvidia will be taking a financial stake in one of its largest customers, but without receiving any voting power in return, according to a person close to OpenAI. The ChatGPT maker will receive some – but not nearly all – of the capital it needs for its ambitious plans to build the sprawling supercomputers required to develop new generations of AI. Nvidia’s initial $10 billion investment would go toward a gigawatt of capacity using its next-generation Vera Rubin chips, with a build-out starting in the second half of 2026. The deal raises many questions. Here are five of the biggest ones: Where Does the Rest of the Money Come From? Nvidia has committed to investing in OpenAI to help it build 10 gigawatts of data center capacity, or about $10 billion per gigawatt. That leaves about $40 billion in additional capital required for each gigawatt of capacity OpenAI plans to build. OpenAI has not signaled whether it agrees with Huang’s cost estimates or, if it does, where it would procure the additional funds. What Does it Mean for OpenAI’s Effors to Become a For-Profit? OpenAI is a non-profit corporation, a structure that dates to its days as an AI research group. It has been looking to change to a more conventional structure that would allow it to more easily raise money and hold a public offering. Reuters that Nvidia would be making a cash investment into OpenAI similar to other OpenAI investors. Moreover, Nvidia’s initial $10 billion investment will not begin until OpenAI and Nvidia reach a definitive agreement in the coming months. What Does it Mean for OpenAI’s Valuation? OpenAI is currently valued at $500 billion, and a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Nvidia’s initial $10 billion investment for one gigawatt of capacity would be at that valuation. But neither Nvidia nor OpenAI gave a timeframe for the entire 10 gigawatts of capacity coming online or for the $100 billion of investment to take place. Also unanswered is whether subsequent Nvidia investments in OpenAI would take place at OpenAI’s current valuation, or at the valuation of the company at the time Nvidia makes each investment. What Does it Mean for Competition? The deal between Nvidia and OpenAI could see Nvidia earmarking a significant number of its chips, which remain in high demand several years into the AI boom and access to which can determine success or failure in the field, to a single customer in which it is also a shareholder. An important question is whether OpenAI’s rivals such as Anthropic, or even Microsoft, which competes with OpenAI to sell AI technology to businesses, will retain access to Nvidia’s chips. The deal also raises questions about whether AMD (AMD), which is aiming to compete with Nvidia in selling chips to OpenAI and others, will have a viable chance of selling chips to AI companies. What Does it Mean for Oracle? Oracle (ORCL),said earlier this month that it has signed hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts to provide cloud computing services to OpenAI and a handful of other large customers, which sent its stock soaring and made co-founder Larry Ellison one of the world’s richest people. But one of the key questions lingering after that forecast – and a question that debt-rating firm Moody’s raised – is whether OpenAI has the cash to pay for the contracts. What Does it Mean Synopsis Hundreds of billions of dollars are floating around in circular deals. Can anyone tell me when, where, and how much actual profit comes from this? Meanwhile, all of this investment flurry helped prevent a recession in 2025.

Title: How the Federal Reserve Could Inflate or Pop an AI Bubble

Time Published: 2025-10-30T10:00:00Z

Concerns about an AI bubble have some on Wall Street warily eyeing Silicon Valley, but others say they're looking in the wrong direction. Washington, D.C.—specifically the Eccles Building, where the Federal Open Market Committee sets monetary policy—is where the fate of an AI bubble may be decided, they say. “I think you’re going to have a very hard time popping a bubble when the Fed is cutting rates,” said Jeff deGraaf, Chair and Head of Technical Research at Renaissance Macro Research, on a recent episode of the firm’s weekly Youtube series. The Dotcom bubble, the U.S. housing bubble, and the Japanese bubble of the late 1980s all popped either while or shortly after central banks hiked rates, according to deGraaf. Artificial intelligence has propelled stocks to record highs this year, but recent developments have raised some red flags. A series of circular deals by the likes of AI bellwethers Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI have drawn comparisons to the vendor financing agreements that fueled bubbles in the 1990s. The Magnificent Seven account for 35% of the S&P 500, evidence of an increasingly concentrated stock market. And the benchmark index’s price-to-earnings ratio isn’t far off the Dotcom Bubble’s peak. Financial bubbles form when unbridled optimism about future growth causes asset prices to become detached from their inherent value. Low interest rates can fuel bubbles by depressing returns on low-risk investments and reducing the cost of speculation. High interest rates can have the opposite effect. “I think it’s early,” DeGraaf said of a potential AI bubble, evidence of which he argued doesn’t appear to be “rampant” yet. Though, he warned, “you could have [a] world play out where the economy softens, the Fed is forced to get more aggressive, and the market absolutely goes into the stratosphere because they’re looking at the liquidity. And I think that’s a big disconnect that people don’t appreciate.” UBS analysts made a similar case last month. The Fed, they noted, raised interest rates by 1.75 percentage points from June 1999 and May 2000, and those rate hikes were a primary catalyst for the Dotcom bubble's bursting in early 2000. “The current monetary policy environment is very different from back then,” the analysts wrote. The Fed cut interest rates for the second consecutive meeting on Wednesday, and the consensus on Wall Street is that the only direction interest rates are headed anytime soon is lower. Policymakers are walking a tightrope as they pursue both ends of their mandate to control inflation and promote maximum employment. Hiring ground to a halt in recent months while inflation accelerated to its highest rate since January. Fed officials have recently expressed openness to cutting interest rates to support the weakening labor market despite inflation concerns. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday reminded investors that the trajectory of interest rates may be less predictable than expected. "A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion—far from it," said Powell. For one, economists expect inflation to continue accelerating in the coming months, and consumers’ inflation expectations ticked up in October, which could set the stage for one-time price increases to become sustained inflation. On the other hand, a weak job market could hamper wage growth, relieving some inflationary pressure in the process. Analysts at LPL Financial also note that the reason behind interest rate cuts can matter as much for borrowing costs and liquidity as the cuts themselves. Cutting rates five times while inflation is stuck above the Fed's 2% target "could send a signal that the central bank is prioritizing growth over inflation control," which may raise long-term Treasury yields and, subsequently, interest rates on an array of consumer and commercial loans. On the flip side, if the Fed cuts rates less than investors expect, bond prices would likely fall, boosting yields and associated interest rates. Powell on Wednesday expressed doubt that the Fed's interest rate decisions would have much of an impact on the AI investment that's at the heart of Wall Street's bubble concerns. "I don't think interest rates are an important part of the data center story," he said. Rather, he added, investment is being funded by strong businesses at large companies acting on demand signals.

Major U.S. equities indexes extended their record-setting run Wednesday afternoon ahead of an expected decision from the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all climbed to all-time highs. AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) helped push the indexes higher after an event where it highlighted a flurry of partnerships. The shares climbed to a fresh high that lifted the chipmaker's market capitalization above $5 trillion, making it the first company ever to achieve that milestone. Caterpillar (CAT) shares surged to an all-time high as sales of AI power-generation equipment helped the maker of big machines beat earnings and revenue estimates. Teradyne (TER) shares also took off after the semiconductor and robotics firm posted better-than-expected results and offered an upbeat outlook as it benefited from AI demand. Fiserv (FI) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the financial tech provider missed profit and sales estimates, slashed its outlook, and shook up its executive team. Shares of Etsy (ETSY) tumbled after the online marketplace also announced a leadership change, with CEO Josh Silverman stepping down at the end of the year to be replaced by President and Chief Growth Officer Kruti Patel Goyal. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares fell after the maker of Spam, Skippy peanut butter, and other packaged foods warned current-quarter results could be hurt by price pressures, bird flu, and a fire at a peanut butter production plant. Oil and gold futures advanced. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro and pound, but lost ground to the yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were lower.

Unprecedented demand for the company’s AI chips have propelled the company’s market valuation into the stratosphere. The milestone, which Nvidia reached at Wednesday’s open, comes just three months after the company crossed the $4 trillion mark. It took Nvidia about 13 months to go from $3 trillion to $4 trillion in valuation. The company’s shares (NVDA) rose 3% after the market opened on Wednesday. Nvidia stock has gained about 50% in 2025 and has been near or at the top of the S&P 500’s best-performing stocks for years as investment in artificial intelligence continues to fuel the chipmaker’s meteoric rise. Boosting Nvidia’s stock Wednesday: hopes for discussions between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping that open up China’s market to Nvidia’s high-end AI chips. On Tuesday, Nvidia’s stock rose after CEO Jensen Huang presented a vision of Nvidia’s future in which the company’s chips would be placed in everything from cell phone towers to robotic factories to self-driving cars. Huang, in his first-ever keynote address at the company’s GTC AI conference in Washington on Tuesday was effusive in his praise for Trump. Nvidia’s AI chips are essential to powering the data centers that run the technology. The company is central to the AI boom not just because of those chips that are making it tons of money, but also because of the investments it’s pouring into other major players. On Tuesday, another tech giant — Apple — breached the $4 trillion benchmark. It’s a sign that that the iPhone is still enough to excite consumers and Wall Street, even as the company has fallen behind in the AI race. Meanwhile, Nvidia and AI leader OpenAI recently announced a major new tie-up, which will have the ChatGPT maker purchase billions of dollars’ worth of chips in exchange for a $100 billion investment from Nvidia that will be made over time. Nvidia also announced a $5 billion investment in beleaguered chipmaker Intel. But the circular spending spree, paired with the industry’s eye-popping growth rates and the lack of clarity around the return on AI investments, has raised concerns that the AI market may be a bubble waiting to burst. Still, Nvidia executives said during the company’s August earnings call that it estimates it will benefit from as much as $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia raked in nearly $26 billion in net income. All you need to know about Ghana's new vehicle number plates | BizTech: Copyright © 1994 - 2025 GhanaWeb.

Title: Nvidia’s $1 Billion Bet Turns Nokia Into The New AI Contender

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nokia stock (NYSE: NOK) is back in the spotlight. The Finnish telecom giant’s shares surged over 20% this week after Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) revealed a $1 billion investment for approximately a 2.9% stake, forming a new alliance to develop AI-driven networking and 6G infrastructure. For investors, this is not merely a fleeting headline. It’s an opportunity to reevaluate a company often viewed as a legacy player. With a market capitalization of $42 billion, Nokia delivers mobile, fixed, and cloud network solutions from 2G to 5G, and now, it’s seeking to position itself as a link between telecom and AI infrastructure. Let’s analyze how it compares. Nevertheless, if you seek upward potential with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has substantially outshined its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has produced returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What explains this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index, minimizing significant fluctuations, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, take a look at – After A Hot Run For Gold, Will Stocks Take The Lead Again? At first glance, Nokia does not seem to be a bargain. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 41x, compared to the S&P 500’s 24. Its price-to-sales and price-to-free cash flow ratios — at 2.2 and 33.3, respectively — also surpass market averages. This indicates that optimism has likely set in. The Nvidia partnership may warrant a premium, but the market is evidently betting on strong execution ahead. For investors, this implies that the narrative now rests on whether Nokia can provide sustained growth in a sector characterized by fierce competition and slim margins. Nokia’s growth record has been inconsistent. Over the last three years, revenue actually declined at an average rate of nearly 6% per year, significantly trailing the S&P 500’s positive trend. The positive news? Indicators of improvement are evident. In the last twelve months, Nokia’s revenue increased by almost 6%, reaching $20 billion, with its most recent quarter showing an 11.6% year-over-year increase. This upturn, bolstered by AI-related momentum and increased network demand, is one of the reasons the stock has attracted new investor interest. However, the more significant challenge will be sustainability. Can Nokia transform temporary order surges into long-term, profitable growth? That remains an unanswered question. Despite increasing sales, Nokia’s profitability lags significantly behind competitors. Operating margins hover around 3.7%, compared to the S&P 500’s 18.7%. Its net income margin, approximately 4.7%, presents a similar narrative — respectable for a hardware-heavy industry, but far from robust. Cash flow generation is somewhat stronger, with a 9.6% operating cash flow margin, or about $1.9 billion over the previous year. Still, Nokia must significantly increase margins if it aims to be recognized as a genuine AI-infrastructure contender rather than just a cyclical telecom supplier. Where Nokia excels is in its balance sheet strength. Debt stands at only $4.1 billion with a modest debt-to-equity ratio close to 10%. The company also has $6.1 billion in cash, approximately 17% of total assets, which is considerably higher than the average S&P 500 peer. In a capital-intensive sector, that financial cushion is crucial. It provides Nokia the capacity to invest in AI networking, support research and development, and manage downturns without incurring major dilution or distress. Nokia’s stock history illustrates a narrative of vulnerability in the face of market shocks. It plummeted 54% during the 2022 inflation-driven downturn, significantly steeper than the S&P 500’s 25% drop, and it has not yet fully recovered to pre-crisis levels. The crash of 2008 was even harsher, with the stock dropping nearly 79% and never regaining those heights. On a positive note, Nokia rebounded swiftly from the 2020 pandemic sell-off, regaining losses in just 81 days, outpacing the broader market. However, overall, the company's crisis resilience has fallen short, serving as a reminder that investor sentiment can shift dramatically when fundamentals weaken. Nokia’s new collaboration with Nvidia could signify a pivotal moment, allowing the company to reposition itself as an AI-era infrastructure leader instead of a struggling telecom supplier. Nevertheless, the figures still narrate a mixed story: high valuation, uneven growth, thin margins, yet a robust balance sheet. For the time being, investors ought to approach this as a high-risk, high-reward turnaround. Nvidia’s billion-dollar endorsement provides Nokia with new credibility — but only consistent execution and margin enhancement will convert that promise into lasting value. You may wish to explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to provide solid returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks presents a flexible strategy to exploit favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Google Parent Alphabet's Stock To Move After Earnings

Google parent Alphabet is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, with traders betting on a sizable move in the tech giant's stock. Options pricing suggests traders expect Alphabet (GOOGL) stock could move about 6% in either direction by the end of this week. A move of that size off Tuesday's close near $268 would push shares to about $283 at the high end, in what would represent a new all-time high for the stock, or drag them down to about $252, where they were last week. Alphabet shares posted modest gains in the range of 1% to 3% in the days after posting its results in three of the four past quarters. However, they tumbled 7% the day after the company released its fourth-quarter results in February, when the tech giant announced big spending plans for this year. As with many of its Magnificent 7 peers due to report this week, investors will be watching for Alphabet's progress with its AI goals, and anticipation of an abnormally large move in its stock could reflect either extreme optimism or pessimism heading into the earnings. Shares of Alphabet have added over 40% of their value in 2025, making it one of the best-performing Magnificent 7 stocks for the year so far, behind AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA). Still, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish, with 12 of the 15 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha calling it a "buy" compared to three neutral ratings, though the stock has already blown past their mean target of $254 with its recent gains. The tech giant is projected to report earnings per share of $2.26 for the third quarter on a 13% year-over-year jump in revenue to $99.9 billion, according to consensus estimates.
