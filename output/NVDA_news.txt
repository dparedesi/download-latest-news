Major U.S. equities indexes extended their record-setting run Wednesday afternoon ahead of an expected decision from the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all climbed to all-time highs. AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) helped push the indexes higher after an event where it highlighted a flurry of partnerships. The shares climbed to a fresh high that lifted the chipmaker's market capitalization above $5 trillion, making it the first company ever to achieve that milestone. Caterpillar (CAT) shares surged to an all-time high as sales of AI power-generation equipment helped the maker of big machines beat earnings and revenue estimates. Teradyne (TER) shares also took off after the semiconductor and robotics firm posted better-than-expected results and offered an upbeat outlook as it benefited from AI demand. Fiserv (FI) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the financial tech provider missed profit and sales estimates, slashed its outlook, and shook up its executive team. Shares of Etsy (ETSY) tumbled after the online marketplace also announced a leadership change, with CEO Josh Silverman stepping down at the end of the year to be replaced by President and Chief Growth Officer Kruti Patel Goyal. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares fell after the maker of Spam, Skippy peanut butter, and other packaged foods warned current-quarter results could be hurt by price pressures, bird flu, and a fire at a peanut butter production plant. Oil and gold futures advanced. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro and pound, but lost ground to the yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were lower.

Unprecedented demand for the company’s AI chips have propelled the company’s market valuation into the stratosphere. The milestone, which Nvidia reached at Wednesday’s open, comes just three months after the company crossed the $4 trillion mark. It took Nvidia about 13 months to go from $3 trillion to $4 trillion in valuation. The company’s shares (NVDA) rose 3% after the market opened on Wednesday. Nvidia stock has gained about 50% in 2025 and has been near or at the top of the S&P 500’s best-performing stocks for years as investment in artificial intelligence continues to fuel the chipmaker’s meteoric rise. Boosting Nvidia’s stock Wednesday: hopes for discussions between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping that open up China’s market to Nvidia’s high-end AI chips. On Tuesday, Nvidia’s stock rose after CEO Jensen Huang presented a vision of Nvidia’s future in which the company’s chips would be placed in everything from cell phone towers to robotic factories to self-driving cars. Huang, in his first-ever keynote address at the company’s GTC AI conference in Washington on Tuesday was effusive in his praise for Trump. Nvidia’s AI chips are essential to powering the data centers that run the technology. The company is central to the AI boom not just because of those chips that are making it tons of money, but also because of the investments it’s pouring into other major players. On Tuesday, another tech giant — Apple — breached the $4 trillion benchmark. It’s a sign that that the iPhone is still enough to excite consumers and Wall Street, even as the company has fallen behind in the AI race. Meanwhile, Nvidia and AI leader OpenAI recently announced a major new tie-up, which will have the ChatGPT maker purchase billions of dollars’ worth of chips in exchange for a $100 billion investment from Nvidia that will be made over time. Nvidia also announced a $5 billion investment in beleaguered chipmaker Intel. But the circular spending spree, paired with the industry’s eye-popping growth rates and the lack of clarity around the return on AI investments, has raised concerns that the AI market may be a bubble waiting to burst. Still, Nvidia executives said during the company’s August earnings call that it estimates it will benefit from as much as $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia raked in nearly $26 billion in net income. All you need to know about Ghana's new vehicle number plates | BizTech: Copyright © 1994 - 2025 GhanaWeb.

Regularly evaluating alternatives is fundamental to a robust investment strategy. Here’s how NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock compares with its rivals in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margin. To provide some context, NVIDIA offers graphics, computing, and networking solutions for gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets worldwide, alongside a strategic partnership with Kroger Co. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a broader, diversified strategy. Time for a quiz: Over the last five years, which index do you think the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed — the S&P 500, the S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework tilts the odds in your favor. Why does this matter? NVDA just recorded an 11% increase in a week — comparing it with peers provides insight into stock performance, valuation, and financials — determining whether it is truly excelling, trailing, and ultimately — can this trend persist?

Title: Nvidia’s $1 Billion Bet Turns Nokia Into The New AI Contender

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nokia stock (NYSE: NOK) is back in the spotlight. The Finnish telecom giant’s shares surged over 20% this week after Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) revealed a $1 billion investment for approximately a 2.9% stake, forming a new alliance to develop AI-driven networking and 6G infrastructure. For investors, this is not merely a fleeting headline. It’s an opportunity to reevaluate a company often viewed as a legacy player. With a market capitalization of $42 billion, Nokia delivers mobile, fixed, and cloud network solutions from 2G to 5G, and now, it’s seeking to position itself as a link between telecom and AI infrastructure. Let’s analyze how it compares. Nevertheless, if you seek upward potential with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has substantially outshined its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has produced returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What explains this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index, minimizing significant fluctuations, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, take a look at – After A Hot Run For Gold, Will Stocks Take The Lead Again? At first glance, Nokia does not seem to be a bargain. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 41x, compared to the S&P 500’s 24. Its price-to-sales and price-to-free cash flow ratios — at 2.2 and 33.3, respectively — also surpass market averages. This indicates that optimism has likely set in. The Nvidia partnership may warrant a premium, but the market is evidently betting on strong execution ahead. For investors, this implies that the narrative now rests on whether Nokia can provide sustained growth in a sector characterized by fierce competition and slim margins. Nokia’s growth record has been inconsistent. Over the last three years, revenue actually declined at an average rate of nearly 6% per year, significantly trailing the S&P 500’s positive trend. The positive news? Indicators of improvement are evident. In the last twelve months, Nokia’s revenue increased by almost 6%, reaching $20 billion, with its most recent quarter showing an 11.6% year-over-year increase. This upturn, bolstered by AI-related momentum and increased network demand, is one of the reasons the stock has attracted new investor interest. However, the more significant challenge will be sustainability. Can Nokia transform temporary order surges into long-term, profitable growth? That remains an unanswered question. Despite increasing sales, Nokia’s profitability lags significantly behind competitors. Operating margins hover around 3.7%, compared to the S&P 500’s 18.7%. Its net income margin, approximately 4.7%, presents a similar narrative — respectable for a hardware-heavy industry, but far from robust. Cash flow generation is somewhat stronger, with a 9.6% operating cash flow margin, or about $1.9 billion over the previous year. Still, Nokia must significantly increase margins if it aims to be recognized as a genuine AI-infrastructure contender rather than just a cyclical telecom supplier. Where Nokia excels is in its balance sheet strength. Debt stands at only $4.1 billion with a modest debt-to-equity ratio close to 10%. The company also has $6.1 billion in cash, approximately 17% of total assets, which is considerably higher than the average S&P 500 peer. In a capital-intensive sector, that financial cushion is crucial. It provides Nokia the capacity to invest in AI networking, support research and development, and manage downturns without incurring major dilution or distress. Nokia’s stock history illustrates a narrative of vulnerability in the face of market shocks. It plummeted 54% during the 2022 inflation-driven downturn, significantly steeper than the S&P 500’s 25% drop, and it has not yet fully recovered to pre-crisis levels. The crash of 2008 was even harsher, with the stock dropping nearly 79% and never regaining those heights. On a positive note, Nokia rebounded swiftly from the 2020 pandemic sell-off, regaining losses in just 81 days, outpacing the broader market. However, overall, the company's crisis resilience has fallen short, serving as a reminder that investor sentiment can shift dramatically when fundamentals weaken. Nokia’s new collaboration with Nvidia could signify a pivotal moment, allowing the company to reposition itself as an AI-era infrastructure leader instead of a struggling telecom supplier. Nevertheless, the figures still narrate a mixed story: high valuation, uneven growth, thin margins, yet a robust balance sheet. For the time being, investors ought to approach this as a high-risk, high-reward turnaround. Nvidia’s billion-dollar endorsement provides Nokia with new credibility — but only consistent execution and margin enhancement will convert that promise into lasting value. You may wish to explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to provide solid returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks presents a flexible strategy to exploit favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Google Parent Alphabet's Stock To Move After Earnings

Google parent Alphabet is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, with traders betting on a sizable move in the tech giant's stock. Options pricing suggests traders expect Alphabet (GOOGL) stock could move about 6% in either direction by the end of this week. A move of that size off Tuesday's close near $268 would push shares to about $283 at the high end, in what would represent a new all-time high for the stock, or drag them down to about $252, where they were last week. Alphabet shares posted modest gains in the range of 1% to 3% in the days after posting its results in three of the four past quarters. However, they tumbled 7% the day after the company released its fourth-quarter results in February, when the tech giant announced big spending plans for this year. As with many of its Magnificent 7 peers due to report this week, investors will be watching for Alphabet's progress with its AI goals, and anticipation of an abnormally large move in its stock could reflect either extreme optimism or pessimism heading into the earnings. Shares of Alphabet have added over 40% of their value in 2025, making it one of the best-performing Magnificent 7 stocks for the year so far, behind AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA). Still, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish, with 12 of the 15 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha calling it a "buy" compared to three neutral ratings, though the stock has already blown past their mean target of $254 with its recent gains. The tech giant is projected to report earnings per share of $2.26 for the third quarter on a 13% year-over-year jump in revenue to $99.9 billion, according to consensus estimates.

Nvidia (NVDA) became the first company to ever achieve a market capitalization of $5 trillion as its stock surged in early trading Wednesday. Shares were up 4.5% at $210 recently, after gaining 5% yesterday following a keynote address from CEO Jensen Huang at Nvidia's developers conference in Washington, D.C. where he highlighted the companyt's latest AI products and announced several deals. The chipmaker unveiled a $1 billion investment in Nokia (NOK), as well as a new strategic partnership with the Finnish tech firm in an effort to expand its AI infrastructure push. Nvidia also announced that it will collaborate with Oracle (ORCL) to build AI supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy and collaborate with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) on the development of an integrated AI technology stack. Nvidia shares have gained more than 50% since the start of the year as investors have piled into the stock amid strong demand for AI chips and optimism about the company’s ongoing growth prospects. The company's $5 trillion market cap is substantially higher than the next companies on the list of the world's most valuable—Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) have market caps around $4 trillion. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify crucial price levels to monitor. Nvidia shares broke out from a rising wedge on Tuesday on the highest trading volume since late May, signaling buying conviction behind the move. Although chart watchers often associate this pattern as bearish, it can also indicate a bullish continuation rather than a reversal if it forms during a strong uptrend, as is the case on Nvidia’s chart. Meanwhile, yesterday’s breakout coincided with the relative strength index approaching overbought levels, though the indicator sits below its July peak, giving the stock further room to move into price discovery mode. Let’s use technical analysis to project a potential upside target on Nvidia’s chart and also identify two crucial support levels worth watching. Investors can project a potential upside target by using the measured move technique, a trading tool that analyzes well-known chart patterns to forecast future price movements. When applying the analysis to the chipmaker’s chart, we measure the distance between the rising wedge’s two upward sloping trendlines near their widest section and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. This projects a target of $220 ($25 + $195), indicating the price could climb to around this level before encountering potential resistance and entering a period of consolidation. The first support level to watch sits around $185. This area could attract buying interest near a range of corresponding price action on the chart stretching back to the start of the rising wedge pattern in early August. Finally, a deeper retracement could see Nvidia shares test lower support at the $165 level. Investors may look for entry points in this location near a trendline connecting last month’s low with the end of a brief pullback in late July.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia just became the world’s first $5 trillion company. Unprecedented demand for the company’s AI chips has propelled the company’s market valuation into the stratosphere. The milestone, which Nvidia reached at Wednesday’s open, comes just three months after the company crossed the $4 trillion mark.

Stock futures are rising this morning after major indexes hit record highs yesterday for the third straight session on the strength of a tech sector rally; the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a cut in interest rates at the end of its two-day policy meeting this afternoon; Nvidia (NVDA) shares continue surging after the chipmaker announced a flurry of new deals yesterday; three Magnificent Seven members—Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META)—are scheduled to release quarterly results later today; and shares of Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) are higher after a strong earnings report. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are slightly higher as investors look ahead to the Fed’s interest rate decision later today and another big day in tech earnings. Major indexes are coming off of a third straight session of record highs, led by Nvidia’s (NVDA) surge to a new all-time high. Futures tied to the Dow Jones industrial Average were up 0.1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Gold futures were up 1.2% at $4,030 an ounce, rebounding from several days of declines, while bitcoin was at $113,200, little changed from yesterday afternoon. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which can affect borrowing costs on all sorts of consumer loans, was a tick higher at 3.99%. The Federal Reserve is scheduled to announce its highly anticipated interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET. The central bank is widely expected to cut the federal funds rate for its second straight meeting, dropping the influential rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 3.75%-4%. Investors will be watching how members of the Federal Open Market Committee vote on the decision after a loyalist to President Donald Trump voted for steeper rate reductions at the September meeting. Market watchers will also be focused on comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who is due to speak at 2: 30 p.m. ET and is expected to talk about the outlook for inflation, the labor market and the economy broadly, potentially providing insight on the path for interest rates. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are rising in premarket trading after hitting a record high Tuesday on investor optimism over a string of new deals for the chipmaker. At an Nvidia developer conference in Washington, D.C., CEO Jensen Huang announced a $1 billion investment in Finnish tech firm Nokia (NOK), which rose more than 20% on the news. Nvidia also announced new deals with Oracle (ORCL) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) as the chipmaker highlighted its progress on AI development. Nvidia shares were up more than 3% ahead of the opening bell after rising 5% yesterday, putting the world’s most valuable company on a path to open above the $5 trillion market capitalization level on Wednesday. A trio of Magnificent Seven earnings reports are due today as investor optimism about technology stocks continues powering a broader market rally. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META) are all scheduled to drop their quarterly results after the closing bell. Microsoft is expected to show an 11% increase in quarterly adjusted earnings amid increased infrastructure spending and Wall Street optimism over its position in the AI race. For Google-parent Alphabet, analysts see near-term momentum on AI for the search giant. Facebook-owner Meta is expected to hit nearly $50 billion in quarterly revenue on surging ad sales, while investors will be listening for details on the company’s efforts to acquire AI talent. Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta were up slightly in premarket trading. Caterpillar (CAT) shares are surging ahead of the opening bell after the heavy-equipment maker posted better-than-expected quarterly results, after missing on earnings in its prior two quarters. Cat’s third-quarter revenue rose 10% to $17.6 billion, higher than the $16.6 billion average estimate of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.95, down from the year-ago quarter but well above the consensus estimates of $4.51. Cat shares were up nearly 5% in premarket trading. Coming into today's session, the stock had gained 45% so far in 2025 and was trailing only Nvidia among the top gainers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom helped push the major indexes higher Tuesday after a raft of partnership announcements. Meanwhile, shares of a cruise operator encountered rough seas as adverse weather and cost pressures weighed on its outlook. Major U.S. equities indexes extended their record run Tuesday as the Federal Reserve also kicked off its two-day meeting, with expectations running high that policymakers will decide to lower interest rates by another quarter point Wednesday. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, the Dow rose 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 0.8% to set fresh closing records. See here for more coverage from Investopedia of the day's market moves. Nvidia (NVDA) shares powered up 5% to an all-time high after CEO Jensen Huang delivered a keynote speech at the company's developers conference in Washington, D.C. The event brought a flurry of announcements from Nvidia, including a $1 billion investment in Nokia (NOK), as well as a new strategic partnership with the Finnish tech firm, whose shares soared nearly 23%. Nvidia also said it will collaborate with Oracle (ORCL) to build AI supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy and team up with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) on the development of an integrated AI technology stack. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) gained close to 12% after the biotechnology firm posted stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings. Strong sales of eczema treatment Dupixent and skin cancer treatment Libtayo helped drive the performance. Regeneron also said it plans to resubmit an application for a higher-dose version of Eylea, a treatment for various diseases that affect the retina. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO), manufacturers of radio-frequency chips for smartphones and other devices, announced a plan to merge. Both semiconductor makers have been navigating headwinds related to major customer Apple (AAPL), which began developing its own modem chips for use in its devices. Shares of both companies added about 6% following the merger announcement. United Parcel Service (UPS) shares surged 8% after the package delivery giant topped analysts' estimates with its third-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share. The company highlighted progress on a turnaround plan that includes efforts to streamline operations, close underutilized facilities, and reduce its workforce, with 50,000 positions cut so far this year. PayPal Holdings (PYPL) shares climbed 3.9% after the payments provider said it would partner with ChatGPT operator OpenAI. Users who are shopping on ChatGPT will be able to check out using PayPal, while PayPal will connect its global merchant network with ChatGPT to provide opportunities for sales on the AI platform. Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE), a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on life science and technology properties, missed estimates with its third-quarter revenue and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), a key measure of REIT profitability. The firm also lowered its full-year AFFO forecast, pointing to lower occupancy projections in North America and slumping demand in the life science industry. Shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities plunged nearly 20%, falling the most of any S&P 500 constituent. Shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) sank 8.5%. The cruise operator's revenue for the third quarter came in slightly below expectations, and its outlook for the fourth quarter also fell short of forecasts. Weather disruptions along with increased operating and interest expenses contributed to the cloudy outlook.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia, already the world leader in chips crucial for artificial intelligence, wants to make its technology central to everyday life. That means everything from cell phone towers to robotic factories to self-driving cars, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced in his first-ever keynote address at the company’s GTC AI conference in Washington, DC, on Tuesday. With AI already playing a major role in consumers’ lives and the economy, that kind of ubiquity would cement Nvidia’s role in a tech arms race now spanning the globe. Nvidia’s at a critical juncture. It has partnered with the world’s top companies, has the ear of President Donald Trump and became the first public firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation over the summer. But it’s also navigating a bevy of challenges, including escalating concerns about whether the AI market is a bubble waiting to burst, growing competition from rival chipmakers AMD and Qualcomm and trade restrictions. In the face of that competition, Nvidia is sending a clear message: While its semiconductors power most of the world’s AI data centers, the company does way more than just design chips. Huang also told CNN he doesn’t believe there is an AI bubble. He argued that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure. “AI is now profitable, meaning AIs are now so good that they deserve to be paid for,” he said. The chipmaker’s stock (NVDA) ended up nearly 5% on Tuesday. Nvidia on Tuesday said it’s releasing a blueprint for how other firms should build massive, “gigascale” AI data centers, which it calls “AI factories,” the likes of which Oracle, Microsoft, Google and other leading tech firms are investing billions in. The most powerful and efficient of those, the company says, will include Nvidia chips and software. A new Nvidia AI Factory Research Center in Virginia will use that technology. But Tuesday’s updates go far beyond data centers. Nvidia announced a partnership with telecom firms T-Mobile and Nokia to build “AI-native” 6G cell phone towers, the next generation of wireless technology. The system will use a new Nvidia product, the Aerial RAN computer, that includes its chips and software. When deployed, the technology is expected to provide a faster, more powerful connection for cell phones and a range of other AI devices, such as speakers, glasses and, eventually, robots. “Wireless technology around the world, largely today, is deployed on foreign technologies … that has to stop, and we have an opportunity to do that, especially during this fundamental platform shift” to 6G, Huang said. Nvidia plans to help build 100,000 self-driving cars in partnership with Uber staring in 2027 — using Nvidia’s chips and “DriveOS” autonomous vehicle operating system — so more people around the country can get rides from robotaxis. It’s providing Palantir with computing power and AI models to help companies build AI agents and systems to automate processes. Lowe’s, for example, will use the tech to create a digital replica of its global supply chain to find opportunities for greater efficiency and cost savings. With Siemens, Nvidia is releasing technology to make “digital twins” of robotic factories. Companies that use it to design, operate and monitor the work of robots doing “dangerous jobs” while helping to fill half a million manufacturing job openings, according to the chipmaker. Nvidia is also partnering with the US Department of Energy to build seven new quantum supercomputers with its AI chips to advance the agency’s scientific research. Nvidia has framed the current AI era as the next industrial revolution, but most companies that have deployed AI tools aren’t yet seeing a return on that investment, MIT said in an August report. And some of the technologies the company is betting on, such as smart glasses and self-driving cars, haven’t yet been widely adopted. The conference’s location in Washington, DC, is no accident. Huang has become a central figure in Trump’s push for the US to dominate AI, and that sentiment was on full display during the keynote — where congressional staffers were offered a special entrance. “The first thing that President Trump asked me for is (to) bring manufacturing back, bring manufacturing back because it’s necessary for national security,” Huang said, adding the company’s AI Blackwell chips are now “in full production” in Arizona, although they must be packaged (a final assembly step) abroad. Huang is set to meet with Trump in South Korea this week during the president’s visit for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Nvidia said in August it was seeking clarity from the White House on how it could restart sales of its advanced AI chips to China, after agreeing to pay the US government 15% of its China revenues earlier this year. On Tuesday, Huang said the White House has approved sales of its chips to China, but Beijing is now blocking those sales. Huang borrowed from Trump to close out his keynote: “Thank you all for your service in making America great again.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

October 28, 2025 13:51 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: WASHINGTON, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC Washington, D.C.—NVIDIA today announced America’s first AI-native wireless stack for 6G, including new applications to advance next-generation wireless technology, in collaboration with industry-leading partners Booz Allen, Cisco, MITRE, ODC and T-Mobile. As AI moves beyond smartphones to cameras, augmented-reality glasses, robots, autonomous vehicles and other devices, wireless networks face mounting demand to support billions of connections at unprecedented scale and efficiency. To meet this challenge and support transformative technologies like integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) — a critical sensing capability for connecting physical and digital environments — wireless networks must become AI-native across hardware, software and architecture. AI-native networks enable spectrum — radio frequencies used to transmit wireless signals — to be used as efficiently as possible. AI-RAN architecture is at the heart of next-generation wireless communications, combining connectivity, computing and sensing via a common platform with software-defined applications. “6G is being built from the ground up with AI at its core — unlocking extreme spectral efficiency, massive connectivity and breakthrough applications,” said Ronnie Vasishta, senior vice president of telecom at NVIDIA. “Working with industry leaders, we’ve created an AI-native wireless stack with advanced features to ensure that America will play an instrumental role in the journey to 6G.” First Made-in-America AI-Native Wireless Stack at NVIDIAJust six months since starting the AI-WIN project, NVIDIA and its partners built a complete AI-native wireless stack, performed the first user-to-user phone call over the network and developed groundbreaking 6G applications at NVIDIA’s campus in Santa Clara, California. The system combines the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform with 5G RAN software from ODC, user plane function and 5G core software from Cisco, and specialized 6G applications from MITRE and Booz Allen. Cisco is accelerating secure network connectivity for the AI era through the AI-WIN initiative, helping build the foundation to enable physical AI and integrated sensing with exceptional efficiency and security. “Through this partnership, we are pioneering the future of intelligent, secure connectivity — where AI is infused into the fabric of mobile networks and services,” said Masum Mir, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco Provider Mobility. “Together, we are harnessing AI to enable networks that sense, learn and act in real time, empowering service providers to deliver high-value business and consumer services in the AI era.” Cerberus ODC’s commercial, fully software-defined 5G RAN, powered by NVIDIA AI Aerial, is setting new benchmarks by enabling simultaneous RAN and AI workloads for mission-critical enterprise applications, while outperforming legacy RAN systems with 7x greater cell capacity and 3.5x higher power efficiency. Breakthrough Applications Drive 6G StandardsAs part of the collaboration, NVIDIA and Booz Allen developed a first-of-its-kind multimodal ISAC application, fusing camera vision and radio-frequency sensing to enable precise detection and tracking of objects even in low-visibility conditions. Camera vision can be used to spot a moving object but cannot track its path or detect it when there is an obstruction. Radio-frequency sensors, however, can reveal an object’s location, velocity and distance, and sense its presence without visible light. Using camera vision and radio-frequency data, the new ISAC application delivers enhanced spatial awareness in real time, enabling powerful use cases in public safety, industrial monitoring and national security, where traditional single-modality sensing may fall short. AI-powered spectrum agility, a new application built by MITRE, manages wireless spectrum allocation within a cell site in real time so users can experience seamless connectivity and operators can benefit from dramatic improvements in spectral efficiency. Unlike traditional approaches that shut down entire network bands when interfering systems are detected, this application uses AI to target and block only the affected frequencies without interrupting consumer services. This delivers an orders-of-magnitude improvement in spectral efficiency and utilization compared with existing methods and addresses persistent challenges with spectrum management and operations. At NVIDIA GTC, Washington D.C., Booz Allen showcased its AI-powered spectrum sensing R.AI.DIO application to detect and classify any type of interference, including malicious signal jammers and unauthorized network users, in real time. This enables operators to immediately respond to threats and automatically mitigate issues to protect network integrity. NVIDIA AI Aerial software libraries make these early 6G applications possible, and new AI- and neural network-based model integrations boost performance and efficiency. In addition, the new NVIDIA Aerial Framework provides modular, programmable pipelines to seamlessly integrate third-party applications into the AI-RAN stack. Application programming interfaces that are part of the framework enable these applications to access real-time physical-layer data — the base form of data in a radio signal processing pipeline — enhancing further training and reinforcement learning for AI models on the fly. AI-native wireless networks provide the path to telecom’s major paradigm shift from 5G to 6G, enabling extremely efficient edge AI inference and sensing capabilities to serve hundreds of billions of network connections and raise revenue for operators.
