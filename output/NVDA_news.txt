Tesla (TSLA-3.33%) might have been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons, but that’s not stopping Wedbush from issuing one of Wall Street’s most bullish calls on the company in months. In a note Friday morning, analyst Dan Ives raised Tesla’s price target from $350 to $500, saying “the golden age of autonomous is now on the doorstep for Tesla.” The price hike is part of Ives’ larger vision for the company: a possible $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026 in a “bull case scenario.” The potential catalyst? The long-promised launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service, which CEO Elon Musk claims will debut in Austin by the end of June — a “key next chapter of growth,” according to Ives. Wedbush’s price hike reflects this “massive stage of valuation creation ahead.” But Wedbush’s vision of Tesla is less about cars and more about code. “We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company,” Ives wrote. “Instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape over the past 5 years.” Ives sees Tesla as a platform positioned to capitalize on the convergence of autonomous driving and AI — an “AI revolution” that could eventually put Tesla in the same league as Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%), Palantir (PLTR+1.01%), Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), Meta (META-2.36%), OpenAI, and Alphabet (GOOGL-1.57%). “We believe Tesla remains the most undervalued AI play in the market today,” Ives said. “The core focus for investors is the AI Revolution is now coming to Tesla...which will make Tesla one of the best pure plays on AI over the next decade.” Ives said AI and autonomous are worth at least $1 trillion for Tesla. And the “golden goose”? The EV-maker’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, which has recently been more broadly rolled out. Wedbush said the automaker could see FSD adoption rates rise past 50% “and change the financial model/margins for Tesla looking ahead.” Still, the road to autonomy is littered with setbacks. Tesla’s FSD system has faced regulatory scrutiny and safety concerns for years, although Ives speculated that the close ties between Musk and President Donald Trump could help pave the way for fewer regulatory hurdles. And Musk’s timelines for autonomous Teslas have come and gone without delivery; FSD remains driver-assist tech, requiring a human at the wheel. Tesla also isn’t alone in the robotaxi push — Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber (UBER+0.83%) are still major contenders in the U.S., and China’s Baidu (BIDU-2.13%) is pushing forward on robotaxis abroad. Still, Ives believes Tesla has a leg up on the competition. “Given its unmatched scale and scope globally,” he wrote, “we believe Tesla has the opportunity to own the autonomous market and down the road license its technology to other auto players both in the US and around the globe.” Wedbush maintains its “Outperform” rating on Tesla, even as Ives warned that the stock’s trajectory will be volatile. “Rome was not built in a day,” he wrote, “and neither will Tesla’s autonomous and robotics strategic vision.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Watch These IonQ Price Levels After Quantum Stock Soared 37% on Thursday
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-ionq-price-levels-after-quantum-stocks-37-percent-rise-on-thursday-11740681
Time Published: 2025-05-23T03:15:00Z
Full Content:
IonQ (IONQ) shares surged Thursday to lead quantum computing stocks higher as the company’s CEO said it aims to become the Nvidia (NVDA) of quantum computing. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron’s in an interview that the company is “in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO) are in the business of classical GPUs,” asserting that he believes IonQ will be the Nvidia player. The remarks come after D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) earlier this week announced the launch of its next gen quantum computer, known as Advantage2, underpinning bullish sentiment across Wall Street’s latest hottest sector. IonQ shares jumped 37% to $45.79 on Thursday, pushing the stock into positive territory for 2025. The shares have more than doubled from their early-April lows and have risen more than five fold over the last year, as investors bet that quantum computing will revolutionize areas like drug discovery, cybersecurity, and finance. Below, we take a closer look at IonQ’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After finding support at the closely watched 200-day moving average, IonQ shares trended higher within a rising wedge before staging a volume-backed breakout above the pattern in Thursday’s trading session. While the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 70 threshold, the indicator also flashes overbought conditions that could trigger short-term profit-taking. Let’s identify two key overhead areas on IonQ’s chart to watch amid the stock’s recent buying and also locate support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $55. Investors who have accumulated shares during the rising wedge could look for exit points at this level near the stock’s all-time high. To forecast an upside price target above the all-time high, investors can use the bars pattern tool. When applying the technique to IonQ’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the stock’s uptrend from November to January and reposition them from today’s breakout point. This analysis projects a target of around $100, about 120% above Thursday’s closing price. We selected this prior move higher as it commenced following a one-day gain of around 35%, similar to Thursday’s percentage change. It's also worth noting that trend played out over 40 trading days, meaning a similar move from the current breakout could last until late July if price action rhymes. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $28 level. This area on the chart finds support from the nearby rising 50-day MA and a horizontal line that connects a range of trading activity on the chart extending back to last November. Finally, selling below this level could see IonQ shares revisit lower support around $18. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this location near the late-October peak and early-March trough.

Title: Kraken to offer tokenized securities, including Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia, to customers outside the U.S

Time Published: 2025-05-22T20:20:00Z

U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken Partners, has partnered with Backed, a leading issuer of tokenized stocks, and the Solana Foundation to bring tokenized U.S. equities to investors worldwide. According to a company press release, Backed will initially deploy SPL-based digital representations of U.S.-listed stocks (including Apple (AAPL-0.39%), Tesla (TSLA-3.33%), and Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%)) and ETFs on the Solana blockchain. These tokenized assets will soon be available to eligible Kraken clients in select non-U.S. markets directly through the Kraken app. Under the Trump administration, the regulatory environment has become more favorable for companies like Kraken. In March, Trump’s SEC dismissed its case against crypto exchange Kraken, which was accused of combining the roles of an exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency without registering securities. Matthew Ruley, director of content for dypto-crypto, a crypto information site, said that by offering assets in non-U.S. markets, Kraken is doing some “alpha testing” so they’re ready to go the second they’re given the green light to begin in the United States. Meanwhile, Dave Weisberger, co-founder at crypto strategy firm CoinRoutes said Kraken’s move is one more way to make crypto available to the masses. “It brings fully transparent access to investing in U.S. stocks to all geographies Kraken operates in. It likely will be available at a much lower cost than GDRs (Global depository receipts) which are offered institutionally today,” Weisberger said, adding that, if successful, this may be seen as the first step towards the mass tokenization of equities. And if that happens, Weisberger predicts lower trading costs, improved liquidity and streamlined operational functions. Other stakeholders also lauded the news. “This is a big moment. Tokenized stocks on Solana mean everyday investors can finally access U.S. equities without being gated by geography, legacy systems, or slow settlement,” says Mike Cahill, CEO of Doura Labs. Cahill says that Kraken and Backed are pushing the market forward by proving that public equities can move at internet speed. “It goes way beyond more efficient—this is about making it more open, accessible, and real-time.” — Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.

A group of global tech giants gathered in Abu Dhabi to pose for a photo as an AI supergroup, including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s (ORCL-0.97%) Larry Ellison, Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54%) Jensen Huang, and Chuck Robbins of Cisco (CSCO-0.12%), along with their new UAE partners. They were gathered to launch Stargate UAE, an AI infrastructure 1-gigawatt compute cluster located in the Persian Gulf country. This comes a week after President Trump visited the region and signed an agreement to build the largest AI campus outside the U.S., with a total 5-gigawatt capacity, of which Stargate will be a part. The Trump deal would also give the UAE access to advanced Nvidia chips, as many as 500,000, according to Reuters. In the closing days of the Biden administration, it contemplated denying the country access to American chips due to UAE’s close ties with China. In particular, key Stargate partner G42 was considered a serious security threat by the CIA in 2023. Trump’s team had no such concerns. G42 CEO Peng Xiao said in the press release that “this initiative is about building a bridge —rooted in trust and ambition — that helps bring the benefits of AI to economies, societies, and people around the world.” Stargate UAE is an extension of a project announced in January by OpenAI with Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) and others, as a massive investment in AI infrastructure. OpenAI’s Sam Altman said it would also “provide strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.” One of the many funders in the American Stargate is the UAE fund MGX. Microsoft was not listed as a partner in the UAE campus. Stargate U.S. plans to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure in America. No price tag has yet been attached to the UAE campus. The facility, spanning 10-square miles in Abu Dhabi, will “be powered by nuclear, solar, and natural gas to minimize carbon emissions,” said the press release.

Title: Forget tariffs: These are the next fronts in the trade war
URL: https://qz.com/us-china-trade-war-tariff-nvidia-huawei-openai-deepseek-1851781781
Time Published: 2025-05-22T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
The U.S. and China have stepped back from tariff brinkmanship for now — but don’t mistake handshakes for harmony. The real trade fight is just beginning, and it’s moving into murkier terrain: microchips, AI infrastructure, and data sovereignty. And neither side is going to back down from the fierce contest over who controls the future of technology. While tariffs still loom large, both sides have agreed to a temporary ceasefire and a framework to bring sky-high levies back down to earth. But the next front in the trade war isn’t about crates of soybeans or textile factories. It’s about who owns the rails of tomorrow’s digital economy — and who gets boxed out. The U.S. and China have been circling — and increasingly clashing over — critical AI technologies for roughly a decade. Washington has heightened controls on semiconductor exports, limiting China’s access to advanced AI chips and pressuring allies to follow suit. Beijing is doubling down on self-reliance, retaliating with restrictions on critical minerals and squeezing the parts of the supply chain it still dominates. “There are a lot of issues [the trade framework] doesn’t address,” Susan Shirk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy, said in an interview. “The tech tensions are going to be a very high priority.” The Trump administration recently rolled back the Biden-era AI diffusion rule, which regulated global distribution of advanced AI technology — a move praised by top CEOs that has cracked open a lucrative market for U.S. tech giants. Now, companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) are cleared to ship millions of high-performance GPUs to countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, supercharging those nations’ ambitions to become regional AI powerhouses. The moves into the Middle East contrast starkly with Washington’s approach toward China. Since 2022, the U.S. has been methodically severing Beijing’s access to the most advanced semiconductors and the tools needed to manufacture them, targeting the building blocks of AI and next-gen military systems. Those export controls, first implemented under President Joe Biden, have continued to varying degrees in President Donald Trump’s second administration. Now, the scope of restrictions is poised to widen. Policymakers in Washington are weighing measures that go beyond simply blocking hardware sales and moving into the realm of research and collaboration. That includes monitoring cloud infrastructure partnerships, joint academic projects, and potential third-country workarounds. China isn’t swinging back with blunt instruments like tariffs. It’s opting for precision hits. Late last year, Beijing imposed export controls on critical minerals such as gallium and germanium — both vital for chipmaking and EV production. And behind the scenes, China is pouring billions into building its tech lifeboat. The country’s top chipmakers — such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) — are quietly expanding capacity, even under the weight of U.S. export controls. China’s leadership knows that even if the country can’t leapfrog the U.S. in the near term, it can at least build a parallel tech ecosystem — one resilient enough to survive sanctions, export bans, or a full-scale decoupling. No two companies better illustrate the stakes and asymmetries than China’s Huawei and America’s Nvidia. Huawei has become the face of China’s tech ambitions — and of U.S. attempts to stifle them. Last week, the Commerce Department warned that Huawei’s Ascend chips are subject to sweeping export controls. Then, China warned Tuesday that the move “seriously undermined the consensus” that the two countries reached when they agreed to pause tariffs, suggesting China might retaliate. Huawei, long seen as the face of China’s tech rise, was hit hard by U.S. sanctions in 2019. But, denied access to U.S. chips and software, the company didn’t fold — it pivoted. It partnered with SMIC to develop chips for its Mate 60 Pro smartphones and is now pushing its Ascend AI chips as homegrown alternatives to Nvidia’s. Huawei’s chips aren’t on par with Nvidia’s, but they’re part of Beijing’s “tech independence” push. Meanwhile, Nvidia, whose high-end GPUs power almost every leading AI model, has become a geopolitical linchpin. The U.S. has repeatedly restricted its ability to sell to China, citing military concerns. Now, Nvidia walks a tightrope: maintaining global dominance while complying with U.S. restrictions. How Washington treats Nvidia is a window into the Trump administration’s broader strategy. The U.S. wants to preserve Nvidia’s status without letting China piggyback on it. Huawei and Nvidia are mirrored chess pieces in this larger game. The chip war is about hardware, but the software battle is just as critical. The U.S. leads in large foundation models, with OpenAI, Anthropic, and others training massive models on U.S.-based infrastructure. These are tightly controlled via APIs and export rules — a “controlled openness” approach designed to balance innovation with national security. OpenAI is the crown jewel of the U.S. AI stack — not just because it makes ChatGPT, but because it helped kick off an AI arms race in which the rest of the world is scrambling to catch up. But China is countering with open-source models, the most notable being DeepSeek, from China’s Moonshot AI, which rattled Silicon Valley earlier this year. By releasing training weights and model architecture, DeepSeek sidesteps export restrictions and helps build domestic capacity. DeepSeek and OpenAI offer a compelling contrast in how China and the U.S. are positioning themselves in the next phase of the tech war: not just around chips and hardware, but around AI capabilities, open-source strategy, and control of foundational models. When DeepSeek’s “R1” model dropped early this year, it stunned the market. Despite running on less powerful hardware, it achieved performance levels that were previously thought to be exclusive to U.S. firms. Nvidia stock dropped 18% in a day — a $589 billion market cap loss — reflecting investor fear that efficient models could reduce the demand for high-end GPUs. But what makes DeepSeek especially important is that it shows China is adapting, not just reacting. “If each nation’s current trajectory holds … the battle for AI supremacy will be fought not between the United States and China, but between high-tech Chinese cities like Shenzhen and Hangzhou,” Kyle Chan, a researcher at Princeton University, wrote recently in The New York Times. As AI becomes the backbone of national competitiveness, who owns the data — where it’s stored, how it’s governed, and who gets to access it — is turning into a geopolitical fault line. For the U.S., the concern is clear: Sensitive data flowing to China is a national security risk. That’s why Biden, and now Trump again, pushed forward a suite of export controls and executive orders aimed at walling off U.S. citizens’ data from potential misuse abroad. The logic is that data is power, and in the AI era, leaking it is leaking leverage. But China was ahead of the curve. Since 2017, it has required all foreign firms operating in China to store data locally and undergo cybersecurity reviews. Cross-border data transfers are tightly restricted. In response, some multinationals have built parallel “data bunkers” in China to maintain compliance. The result: a splintered internet. Data once flowed freely across borders, but it’s now increasingly fenced in by digital walls. For global companies, navigating this minefield means balancing privacy laws, national security concerns, and market access. For countries, it’s about who trains the best models, who sets the standards — and who stays in control. The stakes go far beyond privacy. In an age of foundation models and AI training loops, data is the new oil, and sovereignty is about control of the refinery. Both Washington and Beijing know that the side with the best data will train the best models — and that whoever controls the pipelines controls the future. Both Washington and Beijing are playing to win. The U.S. is pressuring allies to block China’s access to advanced chipmaking tools. China, meanwhile, is financing Huawei-built telecom infrastructure in “One Belt, One Road” countries (China’s global infrastructure aimed initiative at connecting Asia, Europe, and beyond), pushing Chinese data standards in international bodies, and expanding RMB-based digital payments. Caught in the middle are U.S. allies that trade heavily with China but rely on Washington for security. Some are hedging, adjusting policies without picking sides. But in a world where every cloud server and chip fab is a potential battleground, neutrality is becoming harder to maintain. This next phase of the U.S.-China economic conflict is less about what’s being traded — and more about who gets to write the rules of the digital future. Because this isn’t just a trade war anymore. It’s a contest for the 21st century. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Why Nvidia-Backed CoreWeave's Stock Popped 19% Wednesday
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/why-nvidia-backed-coreweave-stock-popped-19-percent-wednesday-11739642
Time Published: 2025-05-21T21:35:14Z
Full Content:
CoreWeave (CRWV) shares soared 19% Wednesday after the company announced an upsized $2 billion debt offering. The Nvidia (NVDA)-backed cloud computing company's offering consisted of senior notes with a 9.25% interest rate due in 2030, according to a statement, and was $500 million larger than CoreWeave initially planned. The company reportedly told CNBC that the deal was five times oversubscribed. CoreWeave said it intends to use proceeds from the offering to repay existing debt, among other corporate purposes. The news comes after CoreWeave last week posted first-quarter revenue that grew more than 400% year-over-year. It was the company's first quarterly report since its initial public offering. CoreWeave makes money by providing its clients with access to data centers, which are used to develop artificial intelligence models. The company’s data centers are equipped with highly coveted chips from Nvidia, which held a roughly 7% stake in CoreWeave as of the end of March, a filing last week showed. With Wednesday's gains, CoreWeave's stock has nearly tripled in value since the company went public in March.

May 21, 2025 16:17 ET | Source: Navitas Semiconductor Corporation Navitas Semiconductor Corporation TORRANCE, Calif., May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Navitas Semiconductor (Nasdaq: NVTS), the industry leader in next-generation GaNFast™ gallium nitride (GaN) and GeneSiC™ silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors, today announced a collaboration with NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) on their next-generation 800 V HVDC architecture to support ‘Kyber’ rack-scale systems powering their GPUs, such as Rubin Ultra, enabled by GaNFast™ and GeneSiC™ power technologies. NVIDIA’s next generation of 800V DC architecture aims to establish high-efficiency, scalable power delivery for next-generation AI workloads, to ensure greater reliability, efficiency, and reduced infrastructure complexity. Today’s existing data center architecture uses traditional 54 V in-rack power distribution and is limited to a few hundred kilowatts (kW). Bulky copper busbars are required to transfer this low-voltage electricity from the rack-mounted power shelves to the compute trays. As power increases above 200 kW, this architecture runs into physical limits due to power density, copper requirements, and reduced system efficiency. Modern AI data centers require gigawatts (GW) of power for the increasing demand for AI computation. Nvidia’s approach is to directly convert the 13.8 kV AC grid power to 800 V HVDC at the data center perimeter using solid state transformers (SST) and industrial-grade rectifiers, eliminating several AC/DC and DC/DC conversion steps, maximizing efficiency and reliability. Due to the higher voltage level of 800 V HVDC, the thickness of copper wires can be reduced by up to 45%, due to I2R losses, where the same amount of power can be delivered with increased voltage and lower current. Using a traditional 54V DC system, over 200 kg of copper would be needed to power a 1MW rack, which is not sustainable for next-generation AI data centers with GW power demand. The 800V HVDC directly powers the IT racks (eliminating the need for additional AC-DC converters) and is converted by DC-DC converters to lower voltages, which will drive GPUs, such as the Rubin Ultra. Navitas is an established leader in AI data center solutions enabled by GaN and SiC technology. The high-power GaNSafe™ power ICs integrate control, drive, sensing, and critical protection features, enabling unprecedented reliability and robustness. GaNSafe is the world’s safest GaN with short-circuit protection (350ns max latency), 2kV ESD protection on all pins, elimination of negative gate drive, and programmable slew rate control. All these features are controlled with 4-pins, allowing the package to be treated like a discrete GaN FET, requiring no VCC pin. Additionally, Navitas offers a family of medium voltage (80-120V) GaN devices, which have been optimized for secondary side DC-DC conversion, delivering high-speed, high efficiency, and small footprint, for AI data centers PSUs with outputs of 48V-54V. Enabled by 20 years of SiC innovation leadership, GeneSiC proprietary ‘trench-assisted planar’ technology provides world-leading performance over temperature, delivering high-speed, cool-running operation for high-power, high-reliability applications. G3F SiC MOSFETs deliver high-efficiency with high-speed performance, enabling up to 25°C lower case temperature, and up to 3x longer life than SiC products from other vendors. Offering the industry’s broadest voltage range – stretching from 650 V to ultra-high voltages of 2.3 kV to 6.5 kV, the SiC technology has been implemented in multiple projects for MW energy storage and grid-tied inverters with the Department of Energy (DoE). Fig. 1. Navitas GaN and SiC technologies cover the complete power delivery from grid to the GPU. In August 2023, Navitas introduced a high-speed, high-efficiency 3.2 kW CRPS, achieving a 40% smaller size than best-in-class, legacy silicon solutions for power-hungry AI and Edge computing. This was followed by the world’s highest power density 4.5 kW CRPS, achieving a ground-breaking 137 W/in3, and an efficiency of over 97%. In November 2024, Navitas released the world’s first 8.5 kW AI data center power supply, powered by GaN and SiC that could meet 98% efficiency, complying with the Open Compute Project (OCP) and Open Rack v3 (ORv3) specifications. Additionally, Navitas created IntelliWeave, an innovative patented new digital control technique, that when combined with high-power GaNSafe and Gen 3-Fast SiC MOSFETs, enables PFC peak efficiencies to 99.3% and reduces power losses by 30% compared to existing solutions. Alongside the Computex exhibition in Taiwan, the latest release of their 12 kW PSU was presented at the Navitas ‘AI Tech Night’ on 21st May. “We are proud to be selected by NVIDIA to collaborate on their 800 HVDC architecture initiative. Our latest innovations in high-power GaN and SiC technologies have seen world firsts and have created new inflections into markets such as AI datacenters and electric vehicles”, said Gene Sheridan, CEO and co-founder of Navitas. “With our wide portfolio range, we can support NVIDIA’s 800V HVDC infrastructure, from grid to the GPU. We appreciate that NVIDIA recognizes our technology and commitment to driving the next generation of data center power delivery.” NVIDIA’s 800V HVDC architecture will improve end-to-end power efficiency up to 5%, reduce maintenance costs by 70% (due to fewer PSU failures), and lower cooling costs by directly connecting HVDC to the IT and compute racks.

Title: Nvidia CEO calls Biden's AI chip curbs on China 'a failure' and praises Trump's changes

Full Content:
U.S. efforts to curtail China’s access to advanced artificial intelligence chips have backfired, Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday, adding that the Biden administration’s export restrictions didn’t slow China’s AI ambitions — they accelerated them. Speaking to reporters at the Computex tech conference in Taipei, Huang said years of U.S. restrictions on AI chip exports were a strategic misfire that cost Nvidia billions and handed Chinese rivals a powerful incentive to innovate. “All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang said. “The local companies are very talented and very determined, and the export controls gave them the spirit, the energy, and the government support to accelerate their development.” Nvidia, which was once dominant in China with a market share approaching 95% at the start of the Biden administration, now holds just 50%, Huang said. The company has been forced to write off “billions of dollars” in revenue after repeated rounds of U.S. export controls blocked sales of its most advanced chips — even models designed to comply with restrictions. Huang endorsed President Donald Trump’s recent rescinding of the Biden administration’s AI diffusion rule, which would have imposed country-based limits on chip exports — most notably China, due to national security concerns. “President Trump realizes that it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said. “If the United States wants to stay in the lead, and if we would like the rest of the world to build on American technology, then we have to maximize AI diffusion, maximize the speed.” The Trump administration has paved the way for a series of multibillion-dollar chip sales agreements across the Gulf region, which one analyst said was a “watershed moment” for Big Tech. Huang accompanied Trump to the Middle East earlier this month, where Nvidia inked deals to supply its top-tier GPUs to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Huang made it clear, however, that Nvidia still sees China as too important to ignore. Last month, he visited Beijing and met with top Beijing officials and the founder of AI firm DeepSeek to discuss chips that could avoid triggering U.S. sanctions, according to The Financial Times. “China has a vibrant technology ecosystem, and it’s very important to realize that China has 50% of the world’s AI researchers, and China is incredibly good at software,” Huang said. “AI researchers are still doing AI research in China. If they don’t have enough Nvidia, they will use their own.” And that’s already happening. Chinese chipmaker Huawei’s domestically produced Ascend chips (which remain less capable than Nvidia’s) are being installed in data centers under state guidance. Washington recently warned that companies using Huawei chips could face penalties under U.S. law, sparking fierce pushback from Beijing and a warning that enforcement of such measures could violate Chinese law — potentially putting a halt to the progress the two countries have made recently in trade talks. For now, Nvidia is navigating a geopolitical minefield. It hasn’t gotten everything it wanted from Trump — the company recently took a $5.5 billion hit related to U.S. limits on Nvidia’s H20 chips to China. But Huang’s perspective is clear: Isolating China hasn’t worked, and only a pragmatic, globally inclusive strategy will keep the U.S. — and companies such as Nvidia — at the front of the AI race. “America is not the only provider of AI technology,” Huang said.

"AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure—just like the internet, just like electricity—needs factories," Huang told the audience. "You apply energy in, and it produces something incredibly valuable: tokens." The company introduced the idea of these data centers as new "AI factories," reimagining their purpose as facilities specifically optimized for artificial intelligence workloads. As a first step toward significant expansion, Nvidia announced NVLink Fusion, opening its "interconnect" technology to other manufacturers. This system enables customers to integrate processors from other companies alongside Nvidia's GPUs. "A tectonic shift is underway: for the first time in decades, data centers must be fundamentally rearchitected—AI is being fused into every computing platform," Huang said in an official press release. "NVLink Fusion opens Nvidia's AI platform and rich ecosystem for partners to build specialized AI infrastructures." This development is particularly significant as it provides developers with more hardware choices, even from third-party providers, for training their models. Companies can now build semi-custom AI systems tailored to specific workloads, optimizing for cost, performance, or specific architectural advantages. Partners including MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip Technologies, Astera Labs, Synopsys, and Cadence are among the first to adopt this technology. Another important development, announced separately from Computex, is that Nvidia expanded its partnership with Neocloud providers. Such providers focus almost exclusively on renting high-end GPUs, such as NVIDIA’s H100, H200, A100, and upcoming Blackwell chips, for AI-specific workloads like training large language models (LLMs), computer vision, and inference. Some of these new “cloud partners” include CoreWeave, Nebius, Crusoe, and Lambda. As part of its vision of establishing “sovereign AI” development, the company announced partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop massive infrastructure for AI training and deployment, mainly driven as part of Trump’s chip accords. The market has responded positively to these announcements, with Nvidia's stock growing almost 60% since its dip on April 7. On Monday, though, the stock was relatively stable—as it has been for the last 4 days—going from $132.39 to $135.35. NVDA finished Tuesday's trading day just below the $135 mark. Nvidia also emphasized that NVLink enables compatibility between Qualcomm processors and Nvidia GPUs. This could lead to AI computers featuring energy-efficient CPUs paired with Nvidia's high-performance GPUs, or even mobile hardware with Nvidia GPUs for faster inference and enhanced gaming experiences. The company also revealed plans for a new local headquarters called Nvidia Constellation in Taipei's Beitou Shilin Science Park. Nvidia is also expanding to Taiwan, where the company plans to expand its quantum operations. For individual developers, Nvidia introduced DGX Spark, a compact AI workstation built by partners including ASUS, Dell, and MSI. Powered by the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, it offers 1,000 AI TOPS with 128GB memory, supporting models up to 200 billion parameters. Just for context, Nvidia’s most powerful consumer GPU, the RTX 5090 packs up to 32GB of memory, and starts at $2,499. "Direct descendants of the DGX-1 system that ignited the AI revolution, DGX Spark and DGX Station are created from the ground up to power the next generation of AI research and development," Huang noted. Reservations for the DGX Spark start at $3,999 per unit. Addressing concerns about AI's impact on employment, Huang presented a different perspective. Rather than causing a job crisis, he sees AI as the solution to an impending workforce shortage. "We'll have a shortage of workers by 2030—about 30 to 50 million people short. It's actually limiting the world's ability to grow," Huang said. "Now we have these digital agents that can work with us. One-hundred percent of Nvidia software engineers now have digital agents working with them to help develop better code more productively." Looking further into the future: "The reason why humanoid robotics are so important is because it is the only form of robot that can be deployed almost anywhere," he said, adding that “this whole new industry is going to expose us to giant opportunities ahead."

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Elon Musk has been the center of the media landscape for the past few hours, courtesy of the near-constant trickling of tantalizing soundbites. Now, the world's richest person has set the proverbial tongues wagging by expressly stating that his political engagements with the Trump White House will continue. ELON INTERVIEW AT QATAR FORUM – FULL VERSION Here's the full interview with Elon Musk at the Qatar Economic Forum a few minutes ago. Timestamps: 0:44 A typical week for Elon1:40 Tesla’s situation has already turned around3:55 Elon's compensation important to control Tesla… pic.twitter.com/G3SxPgBEdP — ELON CLIPS (@ElonClipsX) May 20, 2025 Elon Musk recently gave an expansive interview on the sidelines of the Qatar Economic Forum. Interestingly, Musk conveyed a sense of optimism around Tesla's demand equation, asserting that the EV giant has "already turned around," with lingering weakness reserved for Europe alone. Bear in mind that Tesla sales declined around 10 percent year-over-year in Q1 2025, as the launch of a refreshed version of Model Y idled factory capacity for retooling, and Musk's political role at the White House prompted a partisan backlash. Meanwhile, in Europe, Musk's emphatic support for the far-right AfD in the recent German elections also led to widespread calls for a boycott. ELON MUSK: PLANS TO BE AT THE WHITE HOUSE COUPLE OF DAYS EVERY FEW WEEKS — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Now, additional soundbites from Elon Musk are adding oxygen to the ongoing media frenzy. First, Musk has stated that he still intends to spend "a couple of days" at the White House "every few weeks." This goes against the impression that Musk had conveyed during the Q1 2025 Tesla earnings call, where he implied that his DOGE work was "mostly done." ELON MUSK: DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE PLANS TO MERGE TESLA, XAI MERGING TESLA AND XAI NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION, WOULD NEED SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Next, while not completely ruling out the possibility, Elon Musk has denied the presence of any immediate plans to merge Tesla with xAI. This comes as xAI recently acquired the social media platform X in an all-stock deal that valued the former at $80 billion and the latter at $33 billion, inclusive of $12 billion in liabilities. This meant that the deal bestowed a gross valuation of $45 billion on X before factoring in its debt load of $12 billion. ELON MUSK: EXPECTS TO BUY 'A LOT' OF NEXT-GENERATION GPUS FROM $NVDA, $AMD; “NVIDIA IS STILL BETTER THAN WHAT WE MAKE” — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Finally, in a nod to NVIDIA's continuing dominance in the AI silicon arena, Elon Musk has declared he expects to buy "a lot" of GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD, going on to note that NVIDIA's offerings are "still better than what we make" in what is an allusion to Tesla's in-house ASICs.

Title: This 8% Dividend Taps Into The Real AI Gold Rush

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Orange hologram on black background showing how group of people analise financial data with help of ... More AI Can we still call ourselves contrarians if we buy into “mainstream” trends like the stunning growth of artificial intelligence? Of course we can. Today we’re going to do just that. But of course we’re not picking up obvious names like Nvidia (NVDA). Instead we’re looking to an 8%-paying fund I see having even more upside than the “go-to” AI stocks everyone else is buying. The technique we’re going to use here is a very underappreciated concept called “oblique investing.” Sounds a bit dry, I know, but it’s anything but. The idea here is, roughly speaking, to invest in big forces driving the market and shifting the economy over the foreseeable future. Obvious, right? There’s more here, though, because, of course, doing this directly by investing in the trend itself means you’ll likely overpay, since the market has already picked up on it. So instead, we’re going to look to stocks (and funds) that are well-positioned to ride the trend higher but aren’t the obvious names in their sectors. It’s best to look at this through an example: In the mid-2010s, technology’s rise to dominance over other sectors was a clear trend. So anyone who bought the “big three” semiconductor stocks—Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC)—would have easily beaten the S&P 500 on average. NVDA Total Returns As we can see, big gains from AMD (in blue) and Nvidia (in purple) more than offset losses on Intel (in green). However, back then, buying Nvidia, which was best known for making graphics cards for gamers, seemed like a losing move compared to Intel, which made the CPUs in almost every computer. Even Apple (AAPL) had switched to Intel processors. In other words, the “obvious” investment in the future did not play out, while the closely related, but not directly plausible—or “oblique,” if you will—story did play out. Fast-forward to today and we’re looking at another trend in the process of rewriting tech—and many aspects of society as a whole: AI. Here too, Nvidia is the major player, with its chips powering the AI trend, much like Intel’s chips powered the rise of tech more generally in the 2010s. Thanks first to its gains from powering the tech sector and then to its AI dominance, Nvidia has grown to become the second-largest stock in the S&P 500. The numbers are staggering: Over the last 10 years, Nvidia went from being 0.063% of the S&P 500 to 5.8% now. And as I write this, following the tariff selloff, investors are starting to turn back to the story of U.S. economic growth driven by, you guessed it, technology such as AI. And so Nvidia is starting to recover, but its ceiling is much lower than it was in the past. It’s already risen some 25,000%+ in the last 10 years, and another 25,000%+ gain over the next decade is simply not in the cards. Where does that leave us? Obviously, we want to invest in AI’s ongoing growth, but we don’t want to get into a crowded trade. That brings me to a closed-end fund (CEF) called the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO), which we once held in my CEF Insider service. CEFs are, of course, wildly underappreciated. So, to say AIO is “oblique” compared to Nvidia might be the king of understatements. Nonetheless, this 8%-yielding fund (more on the payout in a moment) does hold Nvidia. So, we get some exposure to the company’s ongoing growth (which will continue, even if it doesn’t hit those 25,000% gains of the past). We’re getting the other “usual suspects” in AI, too, including Meta Platforms (META). But the real key to AIO’s “oblique” appeal is that it also holds firms that benefit by using AI in their day-to-day businesses, like drug maker Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY), insurer Progressive Corp. (PGR) and heavy-equipment maker Deere & Co. (DE). Firms like these are key to profitable AI investing because it’s likely to be the users of this tech—not the providers—that reap the biggest profits from it. While it’s best known for its chatbot, AI leader OpenAI also has many enterprise clients, including John Deere. In short, Deere uses AI to make its products more efficient, such as its herbicide spray, which uses fewer chemicals than competitors’ offerings. That results in healthier, cheaper products, said Justin Rose, Deere’s president of lifecycle solutions, supply management and customer success, in his recent conversation with OpenAI. (If you’re into farming, the entire interview is worth reading.) Of course, these are far from obvious cases of AI integration, so they’re not priced into stocks like Deere yet, and that is exactly why AIO is holding them. Same goes for Progressive using AI to lower its marketing costs and Eli Lilly using AI to discover new drugs. AIO is collecting these “hidden” AI plays for investors to hold for the long haul. Finally, there’s that 8% dividend, which has held steady since AIO’s launch. Investors have picked up a couple of nice special dividends, too. AIO Dividend This, by the way, is yet another benefit of “oblique” CEFs: high (and often monthly paid) dividends you have zero hope of getting from a mainstream tech name like Nvidia.
