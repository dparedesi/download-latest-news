Micron Technology (MU) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with analysts expecting the memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner to swing to a profit. The Street expects the company to report net income of $975.41 million for the quarter, compared to a loss of $1.43 billion a year earlier. Revenue is projected to nearly double to $7.66 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Micron has grappled with growing inventories, and Citi analysts recently lowered their price target for the stock to $150 from $175, citing its high inventory and weakness in demand for legacy memory components. However, the analysts said inventory buildup could ease by the end of the year, adding they "expect Micron’s revenue and gross margins to increase for the next several quarters." The analyst consensus for Micron’s fiscal first quarter of 2025 is revenue of $8.4 billion and EPS of $1.45, according to Visible Alpha. Morgan Stanley analysts also lowered their price target for Micron to $100 from $140 ahead of the company's earnings report, pointing to high inventories and signs of "persistently weak demand across all end markets except AI." Micron could see demand improve next year, the analysts said, fueled by "an AI-driven upgrade cycle for edge devices, continued strength in datacenters, and the potential for a traditional server refresh." Micron shares rose close to 2% to $90.90 Friday and have gained about 6.5% since the start of the year.

Tech stocks pulled back in early trading Friday, hitting the brakes on the market’s rally in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s supersized rate cut this week. The S&P 500 was down about 0.4% Friday after hitting record highs Thursday, with the energy and industrials sectors leading broad-based declines and its tech sector down about 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.6%. Semiconductor stocks including Onsemi (ON), ASML (ASML), and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), were among the stocks leading losses on the major indexes, pulling the PHLX Semiconductor Index down 2%. The Magnificent 7 stocks were mixed. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) lost ground, while Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL) were slightly higher. Apple (AAPL) advanced as its iPhone 16 hit stores. Some analysts have suggested this week’s cut could set the stage for tech stocks to gain over the last few months of the year and into next year, with Wedbush analysts writing yesterday that “the green light is back on for the tech growth trade.” While the Fed cautioned this week against assuming more jumbo cuts lie ahead, markets are largely expecting the central bank to continue aggressively cutting rates this year, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool based on fed funds market data.
