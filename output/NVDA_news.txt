Skip to comments. Posted on 02/16/2025 3:32:47 PM PST by SunkenCiv Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. are reportedly weighing plans to bid for Intel that would result in the storied chipmaker breaking up.According to The Wall Street Journal in a report Saturday, Broadcom has been looking into Intel’s chip-design and marketing business and and has “informally discussed” a bid with its advisers if it finds a partner for Intel’s chip-making operations.The report said TSMC has examined taking over some or all of Intel’s chip plants, meanwhile, as part of an investor consortium or another structure.

How could Intel be so tone deaf to the market over the last 30 years to actually be going bankrupt? There’s no way this should have happened with competent leadership. Let me gues - they went and got politically woke with the business. Yes, woke, and lacking any vision. They got complacent at the top and favored screwing over customers instead of innovating. Competition caught up and now they have to deal with their inferior products, quality control, and some unforgiving customers. “to actually be going bankrupt? “ They have $22 billion in cash ... That’s the gist of how o remember it too. I used to work across the street from their fab outside of Sacramento and had a few friends working there. This is huge. I’m not in this business anymore but it looks to me like this represents a sea change from the personal microprocessor to the server-level AI/cloud. I hope not. I want all my computing to belong to me, including the damned software. I can’t begin to express my contempt for the way Adobe is ripping off its customers renting software under new “licenses” that is functionally identical to what I bought 15 years ago. I was a beta tester on Photoshop 0.1B (still have 3.5" floppy sent to me by John Knoll, which might be worth something), so I too have been a long-time Adobe customer. I agree outside of the generative AI functionality (which is buggy and not much more use than magic wand) Photoshop hasn't really improved much in the past 10 years. “Pathetic. How could Intel be so tone deaf to the market over the last 30 years to actually be going bankrupt?” I think one element is that they have been waiting, and waiting, and waiting, for the CHIPS act to kick in. “The CHIPS and Science Act is a U.S. law enacted in 2022 that provides approximately $280 billion to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, aiming to strengthen the U.S. supply chain and compete with China. It includes significant funding for chip manufacturing, research, and workforce development.” Government largess became their strategy. It’s almost like doing poorly at a sport, counting on favorable draft selections to make you whole. Corporate welfare, like any welfare, is a destructive “sure thing.” I have Photoshop 13. So far, they haven't wrecked that, but it's no more functional than the CS2 version I had. Where they've really got me is with Acrobat, in which I have an enormous investment. By the late 90’s Intel already had a reputation as a H1B sweat shop. These H1B junior engineers from the 90’s and 2000’s now occupy the vast majority of Intel’s middle and upper management. Numerous White engineers laid off to pay exec salaries. Expect other tech companies to follow the same trajectory. Top 7 Things Linux Does Better than Windows ExplainingComputers (YT channel) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOSd7wD-2x4 The second big problem is a 15GB outlook.pst file that I have failed to convert to Thunderbird. I may have to run Windows as a virtual machine, but if I do that, I'll have to make sure I can get that data to work. Believe me: I want out of Microsoft. Bfl Hope this helps. https://superuser.com/questions/19555/can-i-access-microsoft-outlook-pst-archives-with-any-other-tools linux - Can I access Microsoft Outlook PST archives with any other ... Top answer All answers (5) The .PST file is a proprietary format, and AFAIK, can only be used by Microsoft products. There are ways to get around this, such as using Thunderbird to open the file and creating a new archive based on the mbox format. This initial conversion can only be done on Windows because it uses a built-in mail API to access the information, but once you have converted the archive it should be accessible by most email tools, both on Windows and Linux. Answer from chills42 on superuser.com https://www.sysinfotools.com/linux/pst-converter.php Thanks, I'll take a look. I purchased a software product specifically dedicated to that end. It failed to generate a usable output, I think because of the file size. I have parted out portions of the Outlook.pst to archive files to run through that app, but haven't done it yet.

Consumer inflation (CPI) was higher than expected in January. One of the culprits was airfare, with ... [+] used car prices and auto insurance premiums adding to the rise. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images) Earnings season is nearing the finish line, with over three-quarters of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete. The pace of earnings releases eases to 45 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. 76% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Only one of the Magnificent 7, NVIDIA (NVDA), is left to release earnings on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season The S&P 500 rose 1.5% for the week, with the Magnificent 7 outperforming with a 2.1% gain. Markets were pleasantly surprised with President Trump’s announcement that ordered a study of reciprocal tariffs rather than an immediate implementation. Market Returns According to FactSet data, multiple sectors drove the improvement in the earnings growth rate for the week. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Expected sales growth was unchanged for the week at 5.2% but exceeding expectations at the start of earnings season, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. 4Q 2024 Sales Estimates By Sector Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.9% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Consumer inflation (CPI) came in hot for January, rising to a 3% year-over-year rate. Used cars, airfares, and auto insurance premiums were a large part of the story behind the numbers. Inflation has recently accelerated, with the 3-month annualized rate at 4.9%. Help from some of the volatile components and housing inflation should help it ease somewhat from here. U.S. Consumer Inflation: CPI Despite an ugly month-over-month gain for services inflation, excluding housing, the year-over-year rate declined to 4%. If services inflation continues to improve, markets and the Federal Reserve will rest easier about inflation fears. Services Inflation While December retail sales were revised higher, January data exhibited evidence of a broad-based spending hangover from the robust spending data at the end of last year. In addition, natural disasters may have weighed on spending. As long as U.S. employment continues to rise, consumer spending should snap back. Consumer Spending & Jobs Sluggish consumer spending caused the Atlanta Federal Reserve to cut its estimate of first-quarter GDP growth to 2.3%. This is nowhere near recessionary levels, but it is down from the robust growth estimate of 2.9% before the retail sales release. On a more positive note, the easing in economic growth estimates helped bring 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields down from higher levels following the hotter-than-expected consumer inflation reading. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Without as much meaningful economic data this week and most of it impacted by natural disasters, the Federal Reserve meeting minutes on Wednesday could provide some clues to the timing of the next rate cut. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until at least mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts Earnings season continues during the holiday-shortened week, but the pace of releases has begun to slow. Given President Trump’s feverish pace of policy announcements, markets will continue to be on guard, although market participants seem to be adapting to the new administration as is typical. The highlight of the week should be Berkshire Hathaway’s earnings and Warren Buffett’s highly anticipated annual letter on Saturday. This follows the release of the details of Berkshire Hathaway’s publicly traded stock portfolio last Friday. Buffett seems to have continued to reduce Berkshire’s allocation to stocks, but he added one new company to its stable of holdings.

Title: Nvidia Earnings: What To Know About The Stock Before The Upcoming Report
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/nvidia-earnings-what-to-know-stock-report-q1-2025/
Time Published: 2025-02-15T18:00:00Z

While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's ... [+] growth remain robust. As the world’s largest semiconductor company prepares to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 (ending January 31, 2025) results post-market close on February 26, 2025, all eyes are on Nvidia Corporation (NVDA). With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, the Santa Clara-based tech giant has become synonymous with the AI revolution, transforming from a gaming-focused GPU maker into a full-stack computing powerhouse reshaping global industries. The upcoming earnings report comes at a crucial time for Nvidia, as investors seek clarity on whether the company can maintain its extraordinary growth trajectory amid emerging competition and evolving market dynamics. This analysis explores what investors should know before this pivotal earnings announcement. The artificial intelligence landscape witnessed significant shifts in early 2025, marked by the emergence of new players and technological breakthroughs. One of the most notable developments has been the rise of the Chinese research lab DeepSeek, which demonstrated the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of the traditional computing power requirements, challenging conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite these disruptions, major tech companies have doubled their AI investments. Industry giants like Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have announced record-breaking capital expenditure plans for 2025, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure (up from $39.2 billion last year), Alphabet projecting $75 billion in capital expenditures. Amazon potentially exceeds $100 billion in AI-related investments Nvidia’s stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's 17.9% return. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. The company's financial performance has been equally impressive, with its most recent quarterly results showcasing the tremendous demand for AI computing solutions. In fiscal Q3 2025, Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target of $176.55 suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia’s growth prospects. The primary catalyst driving Nvidia's outlook continues to be the unprecedented demand for AI computing infrastructure. The company's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. The company's dominant position in the data center GPU market, where it captured an astounding 98% market share in 2023, provides a strong foundation for continued growth. The H100 GPU was the hottest AI data center chip globally in 2023, later superseded by the H200 and now by the entirely new generation of GPUs based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception, with sales reportedly meeting high expectations. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Analysts expect NVIDIA to report EPS of $0.79 for the upcoming quarter, reflecting a 61.2% year-over-year increase from last year’s $0.49. The consensus revenue forecast of $38.1 billion exceeds management's guidance of $37.5 billion, signaling market confidence in NVIDIA's ability to outperform expectations. The company has consistently delivered earnings surprises, beating estimates by: Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, analysts project 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth, with earnings expected to reach $3.98 per share, up from $2.77 in fiscal 2025. Longer-term forecasts see EPS climbing to $4.92 in 2027 and $6.26 in 2028, reflecting continued momentum in AI-driven growth. Wall Street focuses on the company's guidance for fiscal 2026's first quarter, with analysts forecasting nearly $42 billion in revenue. If management's guidance tops this number, it could help alleviate concerns about the DeepSeek development's impact on demand. Key factors could significantly influence Nvidia's upcoming earnings report and market reaction. Each element warrants careful consideration as investors position themselves ahead of the announcement. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet the surging demand for its products. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, its ability to secure sufficient manufacturing capacity and maintain efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting the ambitious growth expectations set by Wall Street. The company's relationships with key manufacturing partners and supply chain management strategies will be particularly important as it ramps production of its new Blackwell-based products while maintaining a supply of existing high-demand components. DeepSeek's recent announcement that it successfully trained competitive AI models for just $5.6 million, using older-generation GPUs, has raised questions about the necessity of cutting-edge hardware for AI development. However, major customer commentary suggests that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, particularly as newer AI models require more computational power for operation. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that inference workloads are now consuming increasing computing power as newer AI models spend more time "thinking" (test-time scaling). This perspective from one of Nvidia's largest customers helps contextualize the evolving nature of AI infrastructure requirements. While AI and data center applications have dominated recent discussions, Nvidia's gaming business remains significant. The gaming market's health and potential cryptocurrency mining demand could impact overall results. However, these factors have become less important given the overwhelming significance of data center revenue, which accounts for approximately 88% of total revenue. Nvidia's stock presents several compelling opportunities for investors. The company's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 51.1, represent a 13% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio 59.2. Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of 29.2. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by 102% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Major tech companies' massive capital expenditure commitments suggest sustained strong demand for Nvidia's products through 2025 and beyond. This provides a clear pathway for continued revenue growth and potential market share expansion in the AI infrastructure market. Despite the positive outlook, investors should consider several risk factors. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. The stock's high valuation, even at current discounted levels, leaves little room for execution missteps. Any indication of slowing growth or margin pressure could lead to significant price volatility, as evidenced by the 7% decline following the company's Q3 earnings release in November 2024, despite strong results. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. While Nvidia's market position remains strong, maintaining its current market share may become increasingly challenging. Bottom Line Nvidia's upcoming earnings report represents a crucial moment for the company and the broader AI industry. While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's growth remain robust. Strong customer commitments, continuous innovation, and attractive valuation metrics suggest the company is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in AI computing infrastructure. As the February 26 earnings announcement approaches, investors should focus on management's forward guidance and commentary about evolving market dynamics, which will likely provide valuable insights into Nvidia's trajectory for the remainder of 2025 and beyond.

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. Adobe (ADBE) released a beta version of its Firefly Video Model to the public this week — the market’s first commercially safe generative AI model for video, according to the company. The AI video model is available through Adobe’s new Firefly app and Premiere Pro with Generative Extend. The Firefly app integrates with Adobe’s other applications such as Photoshop and Express, so creators can use it for text-to-video generation, video storyboards, and more. “Firefly is designed for creative professionals looking for unmatched creative control and IP-friendly tools that can be used safely and effectively in both ideation and production,” David Wadhwani, president of Adobe’s digital media business, said in a statement. “We’ve been thrilled to hear from beta customers who’ve found it a game-changer for ideating concepts and producing stunning videos, and we can’t wait to see how the creative community uses it to bring their stories to the world.” Personal AI startup PIN AI launched a mobile app this week with a native large language model that allows users to protect their data. By having a personal data bank with PIN AI, users can have control over their data, while allowing AI developers access to insights on their behavior, such as their shopping and investing habits, to create personalized AI experiences across apps such as Gmail and social media platforms. “Unlike Big Tech monopolies that hoard data and suppress competition, PIN AI empowers users to protect and control their data,” PIN AI co-founder Bill Sun said. “It’s a revolutionary alternative to the exploitative practices of the current AI landscape represented by Big Tech and rising AI native monopolizers. We’re laying the groundwork for the agent economy where your Personal AI interacts with the external AI agent ecosystem interconnecting individual intent with a world of services.” Chip startup Positron announced a $23.5 million funding round this week for U.S.-made, energy-efficient chips that can be an alternative to Nvidia’s (NVDA). The round was backed by Flume Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Atreides Management, and Resilience Reserve. The startup is already shipping chips to data centers and neoclouds throughout the U.S. “With this funding, we’re scaling at a pace that AI hardware has never seen before–from expanding shipments of our first-generation products to bringing our second generation accelerators to market in 2026,” Mitesh Agrawal, CEO of Positron, said in a statement. “Our solution is growing rapidly because it outperforms conventional GPUs in both cost and energy efficiency, while delivering AI hardware that eliminates reliance on foreign supply chains.” AI video creator Synthesia launched Selfie Avatars this week as part of its AI avatar service. Users can create custom, talking avatars by uploading images of themselves. The Selfie Avatars are experimental, the company said, adding that it has done testing to prevent harmful content such as non-consensual deepfakes. “This feature marks an exciting milestone for Synthesia as we continue to innovate and shape the next generation of AI avatars coming later this year,” the company said in a statement. Chipmaker Groq announced this week that it secured a $1.5 billion commitment from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to expand its partnership and deliver advanced LPU-based AI inferencing infrastructure. In December, Groq built the largest inference cluster in the Middle East, and brought it online in eight days. Saudi Araba is working on its Vision 2030 goal of having an AI-powered economy. “It’s an honor for Groq to be supporting the Kingdom’s 2030 vision,” Jonathan Ross, CEO and founder of Groq, said in a statement. “We are excited to work alongside Saudi innovators to shape the next chapter of AI.”

Title: Bitcoin's 2024 Return Against Equities
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/02/14/bitcoins-2024-return-against-equities/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T14:28:58Z

2024 Returns and Volatility Bitcoin fared quite well in 2024 against traditional assets like bonds, gold, real estate, and the equity market as a whole. But how does it compare to individual stocks? This matters for stock pickers, and for framing Bitcoin in terms of other major technological movements in the economy. Bitcoin had an annual 2024 return of 114%. The return and volatility are both much higher than the asset classes of bonds, real estate, gold, and the entire equity market. However, the risk-adjusted winner of 2024 was Palantir (PLTR), which captured a return of 353% and a slightly higher volatility than BTC. MicroStrategy (MSTR) came in close second, finishing out at a return of 338%, but at a much higher volatility. MicroStrategy would have handily beaten PLTR in November when its return YTD was 497%, but MSTR shed much value in the last six weeks of the year from aggressive bitcoin buying, powered by equity dilution. Even Nvidia (NVDA) offered a higher risk and return, with an annual return in 2024 of 187%. The major tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta) all offered lower risk and lower returns to Bitcoin. You can see that Bitcoin generally sits on the capital market line of risk and return, with MicroStrategy on one end and government bonds (GOVT) on the other. PLTR is an outlier, but so are companies like Tesla, Coinbase, and Marathon, which all offered lower returns and greater risk. Even the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) roughly matched Bitcoin’s return, but it was more volatile. Now, let’s take a look at a broader universe of equities. Let's sample the companies in the S&P 500 above a $10 billion market cap. A random sample of these companies on the risk and return chart looks like: 2024 Returns and Volatility Again, notice the pattern. Some companies have higher returns than Bitcoin in 2024, but also higher risk, like Nvidia and Palantir. Other companies have less return and less risk, like Disney and Nike. Some are strictly worse, with greater risk but lower return, like Tesla and Micron Technology. There was one company in the S&P 500 that offered a better deal than Bitcoin, with lower risk and greater return. To find it, here's a sample of the companies from the S&P 500 without the $10 billion minimal market capitalization threshold: 2024 Returns and Volatility Here you can see that Sea Limited had an annual return of almost 200%, and a volatility just shy of Bitcoin’s. Have you heard of Sea Limited? Neither have I. So, indeed there may be a better investment than Bitcoin in any one year. But the chances of finding this one company among 500 is small. This proves my point that Bitcoin really is an asset class, not just another single investment. And its risk and return should be compared to other asset classes, not just to other single stocks.

Title: Arm is making its first chip — with Meta already waiting in line
URL: https://qz.com/arm-first-chip-meta-softbank-nvidia-intel-amd-ai-cpu-1851762865
Time Published: 2025-02-13T20:43:00Z
Full Content:
Arm (SFTBY-1.26%) is reportedly making its first chip — and counting on Meta (META+1.11%) to be one of its first customers. The British chip designer could launch its first in-house chip by the summer, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Producing its own chip would be a massive change to Arm’s business of licensing its chip designs to companies such as Nvidia (NVDA+2.63%) and Apple (AAPL+1.27%). Masayoshi Son, the founder of Arm’s majority owner, SoftBank Group, reportedly wants Arm to move into chip production as part of a larger plan for artificial intelligence infrastructure, according to the Financial Times. The Arm chip will be a central processing unit, or CPU, for large data center servers, and will be customizable for Meta and other customers, people told the Financial Times. This could put Arm in competition with Intel (INTC-2.20%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+1.15%), which produce most of the server chips for Big Tech companies. In May, Nikkei Asia reported that Arm is putting together an AI chip unit, with plans to launch a prototype by spring of this year, and mass produce chips by the fall. Arm declined to comment. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Son involved in the half-a-trillion-dollar U.S. AI infrastructure plan, Stargate, alongside OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman and Oracle (ORCL+0.17%) chief technology officer Larry Ellison. SoftBank and OpenAI are co-leading the project, with SoftBank taking financial responsibility and OpenAI overseeing operations. Son will be Stargate’s chairman. The new venture “intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,” the AI startup said in a statement. Stargate is starting with an initial $100 billion investment, counting OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi-based AI investor MGX as initial equity funders.

Title: 7 Attractive Sectors For Growth Stocks In The Next Decade
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/top-sectors-growth-stocks-next-decade/
Time Published: 2025-02-13T18:55:39Z
Full Content:
A truly promising growth sector is one that not only remains relevant in the face of change and ... [+] challenge but is also strategically positioned to capitalize on future innovations and evolving market demands. Investors are always on the lookout for the next Google, Nvidia or Amazon – game-changers that disrupt industries and deliver substantial returns. To identify the right growth investments it’s essential to focus on sectors with transformative growth potential, as sustainable growth goes beyond rapid expansion. It involves positioning for innovation, resilience to economic cycles, and the ability to navigate constantly-evolving global events. This analysis explores key sectors poised for growth over the next decade, based on emerging technologies, market trends, regulatory changes and investment activity. A sector is positioned for growth when it demonstrates the following: The sectors mentioned below are likely to experience transformative growth over the next decade. The revenue and growth numbers cited below are from McKinsey. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will drive the growth narrative forward over the next decade. This is reinforced by a decisive shift in U.S. AI policy, with President Trump announcing a $500 billion AI infrastructure project dubbed “Stargate” to build data centers and computing infrastructure for AI development. The AI market is estimated to top trillion dollars in value by 2030, up from $197 billion in 2023. Consulting firm McKinsey estimates that AI software and services alone could contribute up to $23 trillion in annual economic value by 2040. For perspective, the U.S. GDP was around $29 trillion for the third quarter of 2024. With GDP typically growing at a rate of 2.5-3% annually, AI’s potential to accelerate growth lies in its ability to boost productivity, accelerate product development and shorten innovation cycles. AI will not only stimulate industry expansion but also fuel consumer demand through improved personalization. Catalysts for AI growth include advancements in machine learning and deep learning, as well as breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP). AI will fuel automation, revolutionize healthcare by reducing costs, enable autonomous vehicle systems, and drive personalization across industries. The expansion of cloud and edge computing will further accelerate AI adoption. Nvidia (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) appear well positioned to capture the growing investments in AI. Despite the DeepSeek-triggered sell-off, Nvidia is powered by a strong AI ecosystem that will provide sustained growth for the long-term. Despite the rapid growth over the past decade, cloud services have plenty of untapped potential due to under penetration of the market. Even as businesses continue to shift from traditional computing and storage models to cloud-based solutions, a 2023 survey found that enterprises with annual revenues topping $1 billion had only around 20% of their workloads currently hosted in the cloud. However, the majority of these companies plan to more than double this share by 2026. The ability to bring compelling value to enterprises migrating to the cloud should continue to drive growth in cloud services over the next decade. According to McKinsey, cloud services are projected to generate $3 trillion in EBITDA increases for Forbes Global 2000 companies by 2030, by digitizing core operation, and accelerating product development. This clearly represents a value proposition. Cloud services revenues are projected to increase from $220 billion in 2022 to between $1.6 trillion and $3.4 trillion by 2040. Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the top cloud infrastructure provider, though Microsoft is gaining ground, especially in the enterprise sector. Apple is currently using AWS’s custom AI chips to handle search services, and is evaluating if it can use Amazon’s newest AI chip to pre-train Apple Intelligence models. The health care sector is teeming with growth prospects, thanks to the quest for better treatments and more affordable patient care. From developing treatments to streamlining administrative tasks in hospitals, AI will play a crucial role in shaping the health care sector. The multi-pronged growth in the health care sector would include advancements in telemedicine and remote healthcare (virtual consultations and remote patient monitoring), personalized and precision medicine (tailored treatments based on genetic data, lifestyle and environmental factors), health monitoring and proactive care via wearables, gene editing (technologies to alter genes within living organisms to cure genetic diseases and enhance biological traits – a slightly controversial area requiring stringent regulations and ethical considerations but brimming with explosive potential), digital health data platforms, and regenerative medicine that holds the promise of healing, replacing or regenerating tissues and organs rather than just managing diseases – but also requires careful regulatory navigation. Eli Lilly (LLY) has a blockbuster weight-loss drug in the works. Eli Lilly’s retatrutide has demonstrated impressive results in clinical trials with patients shedding roughly 25% of their body weight in just a year. In the near-term, implying as early as 2026, Lilly’s oral weight loss drug orforglipron may hit the markets. Orforglipron aims to match Novo Nordisk's Ozempic in effectiveness but without the need for injections and refrigeration. If phase three trials succeed, orforglipron could cater to the needle-phobic while unlocking a huge daily weight-loss pill market for Eli Lilly. The growth in e-commerce will be tied to immersive shopping experiences, growing internet penetration in emerging nations and category expansion in developed nations. Retail e-commerce (including food e-commerce) reported revenues of $4 trillion for 2022 or around 24% of global retail revenues. This is estimated to grow to $14-to-$20 trillion or 34%-to-47% of global retail sales by 2040. Retail e-commerce will continue to grow in emerging economies, such as Latin America, Asia and Africa as internet adoption rises in these regions amid expansion of the middle class. In 2022, retail E-Commerce represented just 12% of total retail sales in Latin America, 4% in the Middle East, and 2% in Africa. By 2040, e-commerce is estimated to account for 26% to 29% of total retail sales in Latin America, 15% to 20% in the Middle East, and 10% to 15% in Africa. For shoppers seeking hands-on-experience and enhanced product visualization, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) integrated into the shopping experience will be powerful tools for making informed buying decisions. Other enablers include AI-driven personalized shopping recommendations, influencer and review-oriented social commerce (which allows direct shopping through social media apps), and omnichannel retailing (or the increasing convergence of online and offline channels like ordering online and pickup in store). Quicker and cheaper shipping could also be a key catalyst. Shopify could be a good bet amid the continued global growth in e-commerce, as it supports businesses in setting up online stores and selling products online. The digital payments landscape will get a boost from globalization, increased smartphone usage, e-commerce growth and online shopping. Wide adoption of digital wallets like Google Pay clearly indicate consumer preference for convenient, fast, seamless and secure digital payment solutions. Financial inclusion will act as a major catalyst, especially in regions with limited or without traditional banking infrastructure. Cross-border transactions will further accelerate the adoption of digital payments, amid an increasing number of businesses having an international presence and consumers shopping internationally. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) will significantly automate digital payments. IoT-enabled devices, such as smart appliances, wearables, connected vehicles and even smart homes, will be capable of initiating payments autonomously. For instance, a car could automatically process payment for fuel at the gas station, or a refrigerator could place and pay for grocery orders when it detects that supplies are running low. Visa’s (V) scale, solid brand image and ability to adapt to new trends like contactless payments, mobile wallets and blockchain technology render it attractive in the digital payments space. Cybersecurity is set to evolve from a reactive to a proactive function over the next decade, as organizations strive to safeguard their data, assets and reputation from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, as digital transactions grow and transform exponentially. The cybersecurity industry’s revenues are estimated to grow from $160 billion in 2022 to $590 billion to $1.2 trillion by 2040. The share of all IT spending devoted to cybersecurity could grow from 6% in 2022 to an estimated range of 7% to 14% by 2040. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) uses AI in its solutions, and its big push into “platformization” – encouraging customers to adopt a unified platform for all cybersecurity requirements – appears to be paying off. Palo Alto’s next-generation security (NGS) annualized recurring revenue (ARR) grew 40% to $4.5 billion, of which 53% came from customers that adopted platformization. The company targets 2,500-3,500 platformization deals by fiscal 2030 from 1,100 at the end of the first-quarter of 2025. Agritech, which focuses on developing smarter and more sustainable food production solutions, is poised for significant growth over the next decade. This growth will be driven by the confluence of powerful trends, including the surge in global food demand fueled by a rapidly growing population, and the urgent need for innovative farming techniques to reduce waste, conserve water and minimize environmental footprints in the face of climate change and resource depletion. From precision farming that leverages technology to improve the efficiency and sustainability of crops and livestock, to vertical agriculture, where plants/crops are grown in stacked layers for more efficient land use in urban areas, agritech appears to be getting love from both governments and venture capitalists. This sector effectively addresses the twin challenges of increasing yields while using fewer resources and reducing environmental impact. Scotts Miracle-Gro’s (SMG) strategic departure from distributing third-party products to focus solely on its market-leading brands, exiting non-core markets and emphasis on inventory optimization render it an attractive investment. The company is streamlining its Hawthorne business, to prioritize energy-efficient grow lights, improved nutrient formulations, and automation systems. Hawthorne’s exposure to the cannabis industry positions it for expansion in this high-growth sector. Identifying growth stocks and sectors for the next decade is a complex challenge, requiring both a deep understanding of emerging trends and the ability to anticipate unforeseen disruptions. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic thrust remote conferencing technologies into the spotlight, driving growth in work-from-home and telemedicine sectors. A truly promising growth sector is one that not only remains relevant in the face of change and challenge but is also strategically positioned to capitalize on future innovations and evolving market demands.

Title: A Google-backed startup raised $350 million to create a future where humans and robots are 'true partners'
URL: https://qz.com/apptronik-human-robot-fund-google-deepmind-tesla-figure-1851758468
Time Published: 2025-02-13T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Apptronik said Thursday that it had closed its Series A fundraise at roughly $350 million, with plans to use the funding to scale production of its artificial intelligence-powered humanoid robots. The round was led by B Capital, a venture capital firm chaired by Howard Morgan, and Capital Factory, which connects seed-stage technology firms to angel investors and venture capital. Google (GOOGL-0.49%) also participated in the round; its DeepMind AI research lab announced a partnership with Apptronik in December. According to Apptronik, the funding will help it scale work on Apollo, its line of commercial general-purpose humanoid robots introduced in late 2023. The Austin, Texas-based firm in March partnered with Nvidia to integrate its tech into Apollo. It showed off the robots last month at CES 2025. “We’re creating the world’s most advanced and capable humanoid robots, designed to work alongside humans in meaningful and transformative ways,” Apptronik CEO and co-founder Jeff Cardenas said in a statement. “[W]e’re shaping a future where robots become true partners in driving progress.” Like other companies working on humanoid robots, Apollo is designed to perform work in factories, where companies can train and test how the robots perform simple tasks. So far, Apptronik, which was founded at the University of Texas at Austin in 2016, has two commercial partnerships. The first is with GXO Logistics (GXO+8.54%), which also works with Reflex Robotics and Agility Robotics. In June, GXO said Apptronik’s five-foot-eight, 160-pound robots have “great potential to add value throughout the distribution center,” performing repetitive and labor-intensive work. Apptronik’s tech is also being used by Mercedes-Benz (MBGAF+2.75%) for “low skill, physically challenging” labor, the companies said last March. The automaker is testing one robot at a plant in Hungary. “With expanded deployment planned for 2025, Apollo is poised to transform workplaces worldwide,” Apptronik said in a statement. Last August, Cardenas told Forbes that Apptronik was talking with about 60 potential customers, with a commercial launch planned for the end of this year. Even with the latest round, which took its total cash raised to $376 million from $28 million, Apptronik has far less cash than some of its rivals. Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA-0.03%), which has a market capitalization of more than $1.1 trillion, has been testing its Optimus robots in its factories for months and has started hiring more staff to work on the project. Figure AI last February raised $675 million in a Series B round that included Microsoft (MSFT-0.51%), Nvidia (NVDA+2.63%), and Jeff Bezos’ Bezos Expeditions, giving the company a $2.6 billion valuation. CEO Brett Adcock recently said Figure would exit its partnership with OpenAI and announced his firm had signed its second commercial customer, which is “one of the biggest U.S. companies.” Figure, which began working with BMW last year, could potentially ship 100,0000 robots over the next four years, Adcock wrote on LinkedIn.
