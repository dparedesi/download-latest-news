ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Building a platform to do the job of 1 million analysts ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its Q1 earnings towards the end of May. The consensus estimates earnings of $0.89 per share, reflecting a 45% increase from the previous year, while revenues are projected to rise by 65% year-over-year to $43 billion. This growth is expected to be fueled by sustained high demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. In the prior quarter, Nvidia reported having significantly increased the large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, equipped with advanced AI features and premium pricing, could potentially enhance top-line growth throughout Q1 FY’26 (FY’25 concluded in January 2025), while also improving margins. However, investors will keep a close eye on Nvidia’s future projections, especially given the growing uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policies and tariffs affecting key trading partners. The Trump administration is also considering tighter regulations on AI chip exports through newly introduced AI diffusion rules, which could represent a considerable threat to Nvidia’s long-term growth by restricting sales in crucial international markets. Separately, the past three years portend a 60% chance of a positive move, see: How Will D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) Stock React To Its Upcoming Earnings? Nvidia currently has a market capitalization of $2.7 trillion. Revenue over the previous twelve months amounted to $130 billion, alongside an operational profit of $81 billion and a net income of $73 billion. That said, for those seeking upside potential with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivering returns exceeding 91% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. NVDA 1D, 5D, and 21D Post-Earnings Return Trefis A relatively less risky approach (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair that exhibits the highest correlation, and execute the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the following 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data extracted from the 5-year and 3-year (more recent) historical performance. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. At times, the performance of peers can impact the stock's reaction following earnings. In fact, the pricing in may commence prior to the earnings announcement. Here is some historical data comparing the post-earnings performance of Nvidia stock with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent one-day (1D) post-earnings returns. NVDA Correlation With Peer Earnings Trefis Discover more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), generating strong returns for investors.

Title: Earnings Season And Waiting On The Fed

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Beyond tariffs and earnings, the big event will be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Markets ... More expect no rate changes from the Federal Reserve. The focus will be on Chair Powell’s comments and whether June is a likely time to lower rates again. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) After the busiest week of earnings releases, almost three-quarters of companies have released results. 76% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. This earnings season slows this week, with 93 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. In addition to earnings, the Federal Reserve (Fed) meets on Wednesday. S&P 500 Earnings Season According to FactSet data, the healthcare, consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology sectors contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 12.8% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings and sales growth rates for calendar years 2025 and 2026 have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks higher by 2.9% last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 7.5% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. The group is 17% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Total Returns Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week, and all but Amazon outperformed expectations. While Amazon came up short, the earnings pace was robust, and the stock was still higher for the week. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA) is the last of the magnificent 7 stocks yet to report and is not expected until the end of May. Magnificent 7 Earnings Beyond the Magnificent 7, this week of the reporting season has some notable companies scheduled, including Clorox (CLX), Uber Technologies (UBER), Emerson Electric (EMR), and Walt Disney (DIS). Earnings Insights By Sector According to FactSet data, the healthcare, consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology sectors were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings. It was a broad-based improvement in earnings as every sector except energy saw better earnings growth rates last week. Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.8% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Sales Growth By Sector As discussed in a previous piece, a surge in imports was a massive headwind to GDP growth. Net exports were a whopping 4.8 percentage point drag on the economy. According to Goldman Sachs, this is the most significant drag from net exports on record as companies raced to import goods to avoid the coming tariffs. GDP Components Due to the trade distortion, final sales to private domestic purchasers are a better measure to watch, and they continued to perform well at 3% growth. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. Measures Of Economic Activity Monthly nonfarm payrolls grew by an above-consensus 177,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Despite the 58,000 downward revision of payroll jobs over the previous months, the monthly jobs report has to be considered solid. Monthly Jobs Report The GDP report, especially when combined with the monthly jobs growth, does not signal an imminent recession despite the -0.3% decline in headline economic activity. This does not mean that we won’t eventually see more economic slowing due to tariffs, but this isn’t it yet. Consumer spending did moderate somewhat, so it is still fair to say the economy was softening a bit even before the tariff impact. Markets will remain very attuned to newsflow around the tariffs since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of the economic growth headwind. Beyond tariffs, the big event will be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Markets expect no rate changes from the Federal Reserve, especially after the better-than-expected jobs report. The focus will be on Chair Powell’s comments and whether June is a likely time to lower rates again. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Despite the negative GDP results for the first quarter, the economy is not in a recession. This view is further bolstered by the better-than-expected job growth reported last week. The Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) annual meeting and first quarter earnings release on Saturday were eventful. Warren Buffett shocked the crowd with the announcement that he plans to resign from his role as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at year-end.

After blockbuster earnings last week from Big Tech, capped by Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and a weekend of Buffett wisdom at Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A) annual meeting, markets are still digesting what it all means. The Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq are rallying, but Main Street signals remain mixed, and inflation, tariffs, and consumer caution continue to ripple through corporate results. The week ahead won’t quite match the mega-cap frenzy, but there’s still plenty to watch — especially in sectors like energy, pharma, and industrials. It may be a big week for Fed news, too, with the Fed making an announcement Wednesday — though no interest rate change is expected at this time. The week kicks off with a closely watched read on the U.S. service sector: the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for April is due Monday morning. This report tracks activity in industries like retail, health care, and hospitality — which together make up the bulk of the U.S. economy — and can offer key clues about broader momentum, or the lack of it. Earnings slow down from last week’s Big Tech bonanza, but Monday still brings key updates from across sectors. Palantir (PLTR) reports after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS double last year’s result, amid continued interest in its AI-driven government and commercial contracts. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is also due, with EPS forecast slightly down from last year’s. Ford (F), expected to post flat earnings, faces scrutiny over its EV roadmap and how it’s handling margin pressure and tariff uncertainty. Tyson Foods (TSN) and Clorox (CLX) round out the day — both offering windows into consumer behavior as household staples and prices continue to fluctuate. Markets will digest the latest U.S. International Trade Balance report Tuesday morning, offering fresh insight into America’s trade deficit for March. The data comes as tariff rhetoric continues to grab headlines, making this a key release for economists and policy watchers alike. But the biggest event of the week is likely to be the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. The FOMC meeting begins Tuesday and runs through Wednesday. After last week’s unexpectedly weak GDP print and increased signs of consumer hesitation, markets will be watching closely for any shift in tone. An announcement is expected Wednesday, the second day of the meeting. On the earnings front, Tuesday is a power-packed day across sectors. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also reports, and all eyes will be on its AI chip roadmap as the company looks to keep pace with Nvidia (NVDA). Arista Networks (ANET) will offer another read on AI infrastructure demand. Insurance and energy dominate elsewhere: Progressive (PGR), Duke Energy (DUK), Suncor (SU), and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) all report, giving investors fresh reads on consumer risk, oil supply dynamics, and refining margeins. Ferrari (RACE) and Marriot (MAR) round out the day with updates that touch on global demand, tariff impacts, and travel spending. Shopify (SHOP) kicks off tech results in the morning, with expectations for steady e-commerce growth. In the afternoon, expect Fed news as the FOMC meeting concludes. While no rate change is expected, the policy statement and press conference could offer clues about future cuts or delays. Coinbase (COIN) and Cheniere Energy (LNG) headline the afternoon, offering insight into crypto trading volume and U.S. LNG exports, respectively. Anheuser-Busch (BUD) will provide insights on global beer demand and pricing strategy, while ConocoPhillips (COP) provides an update on oil and gas margins amid geopolitical upheavals. Disney (DIS) also reports, with analysts looking to streaming profitability and theme park traffic. Uber (UBER) is on deck too, aiming to show continued progress on profitability and margin gains. Applovin (APP), DoorDash (DASH), and Arm Holdings (ARM) all report as well, giving another pulse check on digital advertising, food delivery, and semiconductor demand. Novo Nordisk (NVO) will provide updates on weight-loss drug momentum. Thursday brings a fresh wave of earnings from across the globe. Enbridge (ENB), Canada’s pipeline giant, headlines the morning, with investors watching closely for updates on energy infrastructure demand and regulatory dynamics. Commerzbank’s release will provide a read on the European banking environment amid ongoing rate and currency volatility. On the economic calendar, markets will digest the latest initial jobless claims data, which could reinforce — or challenge — narratives around a softening labor market following the prior week’s weaker-than-expected GDP print. Again Friday, a range of global earnings reports will provide cross-sector, cross-border takeaways. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Is Nvidia the next MicroStrategy? Why Bitcoin could be its next big bet!

By adding BTC, Nvidia might tap into the digital finance trend. Crypto Twitter is abuzz with speculation that Nvidia may be considering a strategic allocation of Bitcoin [BTC] to its corporate treasury. According to AMBCrypto, this thesis isn’t far-fetched though. In fact, key macro and market dynamics suggested this could be a calculated move to diversify balance sheet exposure and hedge against fiat depreciation. If confirmed, such an allocation could act as a significant bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. In fact, it has the potential to attract more institutional investors into the market. The U.S. economy is only halfway through Trump’s re-election cycle and yet, top public company stocks have fallen by over 20% in Q1. Nvidia, ranked among the top three public companies with a market cap of $2.72 trillion, is no exception. At press time, its stock valuations were down 24.44% from its Q1 opening of $138. However, this could just be the beginning of a larger decline. Source: TradingView (NVDA) As a tech giant deeply invested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Nvidia is squarely positioned at the intersection of the U.S.-China trade war. This exposes the company to potential geopolitical risks that could further pressure its stock price. Moreover, with rising inflation eroding the purchasing power of the U.S Dollar, Nvidia could face higher operational costs, particularly for components and supply chain logistics. Given these macroeconomic pressures, it’s no surprise that more publicly traded companies are turning to Bitcoin to hedge against these risks. In fact, Metaplanet recently issued 3.6 billion JPY in 0% ordinary bonds to acquire additional Bitcoin. It is positioning itself as part of the growing trend of companies adding crypto assets to their corporate reserves. MicroStrategy’s [MSTR] stock has seen a staggering 3,000% return over the past five years, largely driven by its Bitcoin exposure. It has significantly outperformed most tech equities. This has translated to an annualized growth rate of 600%. In comparison, Nvidia’s stock posted returns of “just” 916%. Even though it trails MicroStrategy by a significant margin. Source: X This stark divergence highlights the outsized impact of Bitcoin on MicroStrategy’s performance. Bitcoin’s surge from $10,000 in 2020 to $96,172 at press time, reflecting a year-to-date price gain of 715%, further substantiates its role as a critical driver of portfolio returns for firms like MicroStrategy. With results like these, it’s no wonder that other big players might soon jump on the bandwagon. And guess what? Nvidia looks like it’s next in line to make that bold move!

Title: China’s “Manhattan Project”
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/chinas-manhattan-project/
Time Published: 2025-05-02T22:00:36Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedMay 2, 2025 Tech stocks have staged an impressive comeback since their recent mini-crash. Is the dip over? Back to normal, with the Mag 7 once again taking center stage? Not so fast. American tech stocks face a number of challenges which could stop a new bull market in its tracks. The risk we’re going to discuss today is the possibility of another surge in Chinese AI technology. You may recall that earlier this year the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek R1 caused quite a stir. R1 was the first state-of-the-art “reasoning” AI model which was open source, meaning it was free for anyone to use or modify. DeepSeek R1 was trained on a budget about 95% smaller than a typical American model. So this naturally caused concern about demand for NVIDIA’s AI chips (nearly all leading AI models are built using NVIDIA chips). After the release of R1, NVIDIA (NVDA) shares crashed from over $147 down to $118 in just a few days. Shares briefly dipped below $100, and currently trade around $114, so still haven’t fully recovered. DeepSeek R1 rocked the world. The prior assumption that China is years behind in AI technology was forgotten. It became clear that DeepSeek has a cutting-edge team and is breaking new ground. And despite the AI chip restrictions placed on China, they had figured out how to make competitive models anyway. DeepSeek’s next major model, R2, will likely be released in the next few weeks. It will certainly be a major improvement from R1. And that’s a disturbing thought for American tech firms. There are a few ways in which R2 could be a major shock to the U.S. tech system. R1 was a major technological breakthrough, but it was still trained on American NVIDIA AI chips. What if R2 is trained on Chinese AI hardware? China’s leading AI chip maker, Huawei, has made major advances in recent months, and is catching up to NVIDIA. Reuters recently reported that NVIDIA met with U.S. lawmakers to discuss the rising threat of Huawei. Here’s Reuters: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang discussed concerns about Huawei Technologies Co.’s growing artificial intelligence capabilities with U.S. lawmakers, according to a senior congressional committee staff source. The issues were raised during a closed-door meeting between Nvidia executives and the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday. Among the topics discussed were Huawei’s artificial intelligence chips and how restrictions on Nvidia’s chips in China could make Huawei’s chips more competitive. “If DeepSeek R1 had been trained on (Huawei chips) or a future open-source Chinese model had been trained to be highly optimized to Huawei chips, that would risk creating a global market demand for Huawei chips,” the senior staff source said. Meanwhile, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang was recently in China and made the case that China is “not behind” in AI. He also called Huawei “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world”. This is the type of honesty required to face China as a rising competitor. We underestimate the country at our own peril. As Huang recently noted, 50% of the world’s AI researchers are Chinese. For years now, the U.S. has been restricting the flow of American and European semiconductor tech to China. This has led directly to China launching a Manhattan Project sized effort to build their own capabilities. In May of 2023 NVIDIA CEO Huang warned that “If [China] can’t buy from … the United States, they’ll just build it themselves.” Now we’re seeing this play out in real-time. DeepSeek R2 will be released in the near future. If it turns out to be a breakthrough model built on Chinese AI hardware, be prepared for a double shock to American tech firms. DeepSeek R1 signaled the end of America’s monopoly on state-of-the-art AI models. A DeepSeek R2 built on Huawei hardware would also signal the end of NVIDIA’s monopoly on deep-learning chips. And if R2 isn’t built on Chinese hardware, my guess is that R3 will be. Don’t get me wrong, NVIDIA, and other American tech firms, will maintain big market shares going forward. But in NVIDIA’s case, going from 98% to 70% market share in AI training would be a severe shock. Additional competition means less pricing power, lower profit margins, and a lesser network effect. In other words, it could derail one of the greatest stock runs of all time. We’ll keep an eye on this story and report back with any major updates. Have a great weekend, everyone.

The chief executive of the world’s biggest chipmaker is getting his first raise in a decade. Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang’s total pay rose to $49.9 million in 2025, according to an SEC filing first spotted by CNBC. His base salary increased 49% to $1.5 million, his variable cash rose by 50% to $1 million, and his stock awards grew to $38.8 million. It’s Huang’s first base salary increase in 10 years, according to the filing, which also noted that Nvidia’s compensation committee “believed this was appropriate in consideration of internal pay equity with the base salaries” of other top executives. Huang, who co-founded Nvidia in 1993, owns an approximately 3.5% stake in the company for a value of about $94 billion. That helps explain why his 2025 pay also includes $3.5 million in residential security and consultation fees as well as driver services. Those fees totaled $2.2 million in 2024, according to the filing. Nvidia’s market capitalization has ballooned in recent years as the Santa Clara, California-based firm leads the charge in AI chipmaking. The company’s full-year revenue reached $130.5 billion in the 2025 fiscal year, a 114% jump year-over-year. Its stock price multiplied ninefold between the end of 2022 and the end of 2024. Still, the company has faced headwinds in recent months. Under both President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, the U.S. has tightened restrictions that limit chip exports to China, thereby limiting Nvidia’s potential market. Nvidia designed its H20 chip, in particular, to comply with U.S. export rules — but those rules became even stricter and barred Nvidia from selling them in China. Huawei, one of China’s biggest tech companies, is getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival Nvidia’s, according to a report last month. The firm will receive its first shipment of Ascend 910E chips, its most powerful AI semiconductor to date, from manufacturers as soon as the end of May. Huawei has made persistent technological advances in recent years despite U.S. sanctions against it and could threaten Nvidia’s AI chipmaking dominance. Shares of Nvidia were up 2.3% Friday morning but are down 17.4% since the start of the year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Microsoft (MSFT) stock soared on Thursday after the tech giant’s quarterly results handily beat Wall Street estimates. Shares closed up 7.6% at $425.20, a jump that marks the stock’s second-best post-earnings performance in nearly 10 years. The last time Microsoft stock popped significantly more than that on earnings was in October 2015 when the company reported revenue from its nascent Azure cloud computing business had more than doubled from the prior year, and shares surged 10%. Wall Street on Thursday was cheering strong results in each of Microsoft’s major business lines. Sales at the company’s cloud computing unit rose 22% in constant currency (cc) terms to nearly $27 billion. Revenue at its productivity and business software unit also grew double digits, and even devices revenue—a soft spot for most tech companies of late—increased 3%.(cc) But it was the Azure business, Microsoft's cloud computing and AI platform, that really excited Wall Street. Azure growth accelerated to 35% (cc) in the quarter, well ahead of analysts' forecasts. CFO Amy Hood on Wednesday's earnings call noted that, despite recent economic uncertainty, AI demand continued to grow faster than Microsoft's supply. Hood's warning helped to assuage some fear on Wall Street that macroeconomic headwinds would stunt AI growth. The AI stocks that tumbled from their record highs earlier this year—like chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and nuclear power providers Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST)—led Thursday's rally. Analysts at BMO raised their price target to $485 on Thursday morning, citing “improved Azure growth.” Bank of America Securities analysts noted Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI was a major driver behind the Azure beat, “which should allay fears that the partnership has frayed a bit.” The firm raised its price target on the stock by 7% to $515, and reiterated its “top pick” call. “We remain confident that MSFT's revenue growth opportunities over the medium-term and beyond are greater than many realize, and we continue to be very bullish on its tangible GenAI adoption and monetization levers,” Mizuho Americas analysts wrote on Thursday as they raised their price target to $500.

But these devices are real, developed by a startup co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and are now available in six U.S. cities. Thank you for signing up!

The devices can now be found in seven locations cross Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco. World is the brainchild of Tools for Humanity, a company established by Altman and deep learning researcher Alex Blania in 2019. Its mission is to establish a simple, secure form of human verification in a future where A.I. could blur the line between people and bots online. Initially called Worldcoin and rebranded as World last year, the project aims to create a unique “World ID” for individuals—verifiable proof of personhood that can also be used for cryptocurrency transactions and other digital services. World IDs are generated by scans from Orbs, which are currently available in nearly 900 locations worldwide, according to the World website. World aims to deploy 7,500 Orb devices across the U.S. by the end of the year, with the goal of reaching 180 million Americans. Globally, the project already claims 12 million verified World ID holders and ultimately aims for 1 billion users. Here’s how the Orbs work: the device takes about 30 seconds to scan a person’s irises, collecting data to generate a World ID and rewarding users with a small amount of the project’s WLD cryptocurrency. Powered by Nvidia’s Jetson chipset, the Orb measures iris patterns rather than more common biometric data like fingerprints, which are more susceptible to external changes. For the first time, Tools for Humanity will begin assembling some of its Orbs in the U.S., launching a domestic production line in Richardson, Texas. Following the initial rollout in its first six cities, the company plans to expand to Seattle, Orlando, San Diego and Las Vegas. “They will really be everywhere,” said Blania at the launch event. “They’ll be in gas stations, convenience stores—you’ll be able to verify yourself in 10 minutes, basically wherever you are.” Despite its seemingly wacky premise, World has attracted the backing of major Silicon Valley investors. Since 2019, it has raised more than $240 million from firms including Andreessen Horowitz, khosla ventures, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, according to Crunchbase. Alongside its U.S. expansion, World also announced two new partnerships aimed at advancing its digital ID vision. A collaboration with Visa will introduce the “World Card” later this year, allowing World ID holders to spend digital assets anywhere Visa is accepted. World is also partnering with Match Group to pilot World ID as an age verification tool for online dating platforms, starting with Tinder users in Japan.

Big tech stocks are having a magnificent Thursday. Pushed higher by optimism associated with elements of last night’s financial results from Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT), shares of all of the Magnificent Seven stocks were rising—and taking the major indexes higher with them. Microsoft's stock was recently close to 9% higher, while Meta's was up more than 5%. Both companies' shares were among the top gainers in the S&P 500. CNBC’s Magnificent Seven Index, which tracks the performance of the aforementioned pair of stocks as well as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA), was recently up 3.5%. That was a bigger upward move than seen in any of the major U.S. indexes today, which were led by the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite, up more than 2.5%. (Read Investopedia’s full daily markets coverage here.) Nearly all of the remaining Magnificent Seven shares were up more than 1%, with Nvidia's rising almost 5%. Apple's, on the other hand, were little changed. Questions about U.S. trade policy and other economic concerns have weighed on indexes in recent weeks, though the major indexes have risen recently as some fears appear to have receded. Apple and Amazon are set to report their results after today’s close; after that, the next—and last—up is Nvidia, which is scheduled for May 28. (You can read our previews for the Amazon and Apple results here and here, respectively.)
