One of Dublin 4’s most sought after addresses, Pembroke Road, is a short stroll to cafes and restaurants on Baggot Street Upper and a short walk up the two bridges in either direction on the Grand Canal will take you to local Dart and Luas stops. A 15-minute stroll will have you in the centre of St Stephen’s Green, the Aviva Stadium for rugby internationals and the villages of Ranelagh, Donnybrook and Sandymount, all of which have a great selection of pubs and restaurants. Number 75 Pembroke Road is set well back from the road itself. It originally had an office block to one side, which was replaced in the 1970s with a set of apartments, though is accessed through the original period doorway. Located just off the junction triangle of Northumberland, Lansdowne and Pembroke Roads, it’s as smack bang in the centre of Ballsbridge as you can get. Sharing its site with 30 other units, number 21 Pembroke Court is a second-floor dual aspect apartment that has just been released to the market through estate agent Owen Reilly. It has three bedrooms and a generous 97sq m (1,044sq ft) of floor space that has undergone a recent transformation since its owner purchased the unit in early 2021, for €525,000, according to the Property Price Register. It’s a smashing renovation of a 1970s unit that had little in the way of features until its owners gave it a stylish upgrade: “It was easy to see its potential, even though nothing had been done since the 1970s,” says its owner, adding “you don’t always get the luxury of all-square rooms, with proper windows that overlook a garden, but that, and the location made us buy”. With the help of Belgradian architectural duo Tihomir Dicic and Iva Njunic, the entire space has been reimagined to a superb, spacious three-bedroom contemporary apartment in the heart of one of the most desirable addresses in Dublin. By removing small hallways, the entire unit was opened up to give a lovely internal flow with the benefit of lots of light from large windows, all of which have been replaced with more energy-efficient aluclad units. When the walls were being insulated and upgraded, builders discovered the original brick walls of the period property next door. With advice from the architects that it could be exposed, and though it took “lots of cleaning and sealing” it is now a standout feature in the apartment, which owners have highlighted with the use of smart LED lights in an overhead shadow gap. In fact, thoughtful lighting – as 1970s ceilings are rarely high – was one of the many considerations when this unit was being refurbished. Central to the living space – off the dining and kitchen area – is a modular unit the family sourced from Nordic Elements in Blackrock, which sits so well around the television that you would think it was custom made for the room. Solid oak floors run through the C1-rated apartment, which has a streamlined kitchen with Bosch appliances and the focus on storage at design stage, allows the whole place to be streamlined and clutter free – despite this being home to a family with young children. Its three bedrooms comprise of two doubles and a single, and the family who live here say they were amazed at how the architects managed to rearrange the space to accommodate an en suite and so much storage in their home. Even the bathrooms are luxuriously subtle in a pared back kind of way, with focus on storage and illuminating soft tones from the wood. The owners, who are moving due to a growing family, have loved their time here – especially the garden out front where their children play – and say they live a mostly car-free life due to the location. This unit shows what a 1970s apartment can become with a bit of thought, and is now seeking €800,000 through Owen Reilly.

Share this article Bitcoin whales executed around $3 billion in ETF trades through BlackRock’s $IBIT, a spot Bitcoin ETF, using portfolio trade mechanisms that offer significant portfolio benefits, Bloomberg reported today. The trades allow large Bitcoin holders to convert their holdings directly into ETF shares through custom creation processes. BlackRock has been facilitating these in-kind creations for $IBIT, enabling Bitcoin whales to seamlessly integrate their holdings into traditional finance portfolios. The structure mirrors portfolio trades commonly used in bond markets, where assets are exchanged directly rather than through cash transactions. The portfolio trade mechanism provides Bitcoin whales with benefits including enhanced liquidity and tax efficiencies. These custom ETF creation methods have gained traction in crypto markets as institutional investors seek regulated investment vehicles for their digital asset holdings. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has seen heightened institutional interest as traditional finance firms adapt to cryptocurrency integrations through ETF structures. The asset management giant has been expanding its crypto offerings in response to evolving investor demands for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Samsung Galaxy XR hands-on: Just the opening act

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. October 21, 2025 For nearly a year, Samsung has been hyping up a new XR headset, previously known as Project Moohan. Now, finally, we know everything there is to know about the device, which is officially called the Samsung Galaxy XR. It’s the product of a massive collaboration between Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm, and it’s packed with impressive tech. I got to spend some time with the device at Samsung’s New York City launch event last week, and I want to say something a little unexpected, something I noticed after testing it. While Samsung clearly wants to sell as many of these as possible — it is a business chasing profit, after all — it was also made clear to me at the keynote that the well-known Apple Vision Pro sales failure is hanging heavy over this launch. In fact, this is one of the few launches I’ve ever been to in which the presenters actively told us that this product is “just the beginning” and that better things are on the way. So that leads us to the big question, which is whether or not you will actually buy this $1,799 headset. And let me tell you a secret: I think Samsung isn’t expecting you to. After my hands-on demo, it was clear that this headset is likely a foundational product designed to pave the way for the real revolution: future smart glasses powered by Android XR. Before I get into all that, though, let me tell you about the headset. If you’ve ever used a VR headset before, there are no real surprises here. The Galaxy XR hasn’t changed all that much from when it was first shown off as a prototype way back in December 2024. It has a glass front that protects multiple cameras and sensors. There are thick straps that connect the main headset to the back padding, which has a big dial on it for tightening or loosening the straps. There are three buttons on the headset: a multi-function button on the top right, and then a volume rocker on the top left. It was comfortable to wear, and it comes with removable light blockers that can help you be more immersed in your content by blocking off your peripheral vision. Conversely, you can remove them to keep yourself grounded in the real world (and hopefully offset any VR dizziness). Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority? Like Apple’s Vision Pro, the battery is not built into the headset. Instead, it’s a self-contained pack (see below) that connects to the device using a proprietary pin system. You can keep the battery in your pocket or rest it on the couch next to you while you are immersed in the VR world. The reason the Galaxy XR is designed this way is to keep that hefty battery weight off your head, which should make it more comfortable to use it for extended periods. According to Samsung, you should be able to get about two hours of use based on one battery pack charge. There’s been no word on whether or not you’ll be able to buy additional battery packs. Inside the headset are two displays (3,552 x 3,840 at 60Hz, 72Hz, or 90Hz) that automatically adjust themselves based on your face. This is made possible thanks to multiple sensors and cameras inside that perform eye-tracking functions. This means you don’t need to fiddle with knobs or move the lenses around to get the right focus — the headset does all the adjustments for you. For audio, there are small speakers above your ears that blast the sound out. This allows you to avoid wearing headphones and also lets you still hear the real world around you. Of course, if you’d prefer to use Bluetooth headphones, that’s totally fine, as the headset supports Bluetooth connections of all kinds, including earbuds, gaming controllers, mice and keyboards, and more. Unfortunately, the Galaxy XR doesn’t come with any of that stuff. When you buy it, you just get the headset and the battery pack. Samsung has made VR-style controllers specifically for the Galaxy XR, but they are an additional purchase. The fact that the headset doesn’t come with controllers is not such a big deal, though, as Google and Samsung want you to use your hands and your voice for controls all the time. So how do you use it without controllers? This is where the magic of the device really becomes apparent. Outside the headset, multiple cameras and sensors track everything your hands do in real-time. There are lots of downward-facing cameras on the front that capture your hand motions. Using these, you can control the operating system with hand gestures. A pinch acts as a left mouse click, and a pinch and hold acts as holding down the left mouse button, so you can drag windows around. You can use two hands to pinch to zoom in and out. Turning your hand around and pinching opens menus. Meanwhile, the eye-tracking cameras inside are monitoring your eyes at all times. This allows you to simply look at something and the headset understands what you’re looking at, which makes controlling things faster and easier. With this combination of hand- and eye-tracking, you can manipulate things in your VR environment without needing to hold a controller or have any sort of apparatus on your hands or wrists. The headset also offers opportunities for augmented reality experiences. The real world can be projected into the headset in full color with very low latency. Using Circle to Search, you could circle pretty much anything in the real world and do a search for it. Of course, you probably wouldn’t be caught dead wearing this around town, but it is fully wireless, so you could if you wanted to. The Galaxy XR hardware is all Samsung, but the software — known as Android XR — is all Google. As its name suggests, this is based on Android, so it works very similarly to what you’ve been using on your phones and tablets for nearly two decades. I expected it to come with something like One UI on board with a distinctly Samsung-ified look and feel, but instead, all I saw everywhere was Google apps in their usual stock style. There was nothing in the software that said Samsung at all, at least nothing that was shown in the keynote or demoed for me during my session. Every single thing was Google this and Google that. Where’s Galaxy AI? Where’s One UI? Where are the Samsung apps? Where’s Bixby? Regardless, because Android XR is based on Android, nearly every app and game on the Play Store will automatically work with the headset. It will present the app in its native format in a 2D window, and you can use it as normal. However, we do have a lot of unanswered questions about the OS. Will it be available to any company that wants to make a headset, just like Android is available to any company that wants to make a phone? How much will companies be able to customize it? How often will devices get updates? I asked a Google rep about all this, and they said that the company would announce all that in due time. So what is it actually like using this thing? At its core, the Galaxy XR is simply a VR headset with multiple opportunities for entertainment. The two most significant differentiators from the competition are its gaming prowess and the deep integration of Google’s Gemini. If you’re a gamer, you should know that this headset is going to be much better for gaming than the Apple Vision Pro and maybe even the Meta Quest 3. It will support Steam VR games when connected to a VR-ready PC and will also support 2D games through existing apps like Steam Link and Moonlight. It will also support pretty much every game on the Google Play Store. Connecting a standard controller to the headset via Bluetooth is dead simple. As mentioned earlier, you’ll be able to get VR-style controllers from Samsung as an additional purchase, opening the doors to all sorts of existing VR games. Apple made a big mistake by not working hard to support these kinds of experiences with the Vision Pro, so it’s great to see Google and Samsung aren’t making the same mistake. Even more significant than gaming, though, is Gemini. When Google announced Android XR at the end of 2024, it specifically called out that it was the first operating system designed from the ground up for what it calls the Gemini era. In other words, Android XR was built with Gemini already in mind. As such, it permeates everywhere throughout the operating system. You can activate Gemini at any time by holding down the multi-function button. This allows you to not only speak to Gemini but also easily show it your display, allowing you to ask questions about what you’re doing. For example, you could be playing a game and pull up Gemini to help you out with it. You wouldn’t need to explain anything to it, because it would be able to see the game, what level you’re on, your character’s health, and all that. If you have a bunch of windows open within your virtual environment, you can just ask Gemini to organize them for you. The really cool thing is that you can do this conversationally using Gemini Live; you don’t need to say “Hey Gemini” all the time. The demos I tried really hammered home how central Gemini is to the experience. The first thing I saw was Google Photos. The app looks and works just like it does on your phone, but the software can make any photo stereoscopic, which means it appears to have depth. You can easily turn this on or off with any photo in your library, and the depth effect is created on-device on the fly. Gemini works here for helping you find specific photos without needing to scroll through. Just say, “Show me my photos from our trip to France, Gemini.” After Google Photos, we jumped into Google Maps. You start out with an aerial view of the Earth, as if you were floating in space. You can then tell Gemini to take you anywhere you like, and you’ll zoom into that area, floating above it like a bird. You can then zoom in even further to explore places in street view, so it feels like you’re walking around the destination. Here, you can have a chat with Gemini as you’re exploring. Let’s say you spot a landmark; you can simply look at it and ask Gemini about it, and the AI will tell you whatever you want to know. The really cool thing, though, is you can actually walk inside select buildings. Google does this by using AI to stitch together existing photos and videos available on Google Maps, creating a realistic 3D environment. There are already over 1,000 locations in New York that work for this, such as the restaurant in the video below. Finally, we tried YouTube. I viewed an immersive 360-degree video shot specifically for headsets like the Galaxy XR, as well as an interactive 3D film where I could reach out and “touch” objects. I also watched one of my own videos that was automatically converted to be stereoscopic, which was pretty cool. However, that specific feature will not work when you take the Galaxy XR out of the box. Eventually, it will work on most YouTube videos, but it will be a while before it’s active. The Samsung Galaxy XR starts at $1,799, which is literally half the price of the Apple Vision Pro. While this definitely makes the device more affordable, $1,800 is still very, very expensive. This isn’t a tech product you just decide to buy one day. The Vision Pro has also been a well-established bomb for Apple, with sales figures estimated to be less than one million units. Samsung might be undercutting Apple on price by a wide margin, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s launching into a market that even Apple, the master of busting up existing markets, couldn’t crack. This is why I think the Galaxy XR is just an opening act. The real revolution will be smart glasses that do most of the things the Galaxy XR can do, but do it in the real world. We know this is coming, too, because Samsung and Google are already hyping them up with partnerships with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. If Samsung and its partners can make smart glasses that allow you to bring Android XR with you wherever you go and include an AI companion that can jump in and help you whenever needed, it could have a revolution on its hands. The Galaxy XR seems like a terrific product, but it’s still, at its core, just another VR headset. Most people who buy this will use it to play games and watch movies in their homes, by themselves. That doesn’t add up to a device that changes your life — that adds up to a TV screen you attach to your face. The idea that you can already do that with existing devices— and have been able to for a decade — makes this feel less like a revolutionary new product and more like a way-too-late entry into a plateaued market. So, will you buy the Galaxy XR? Or will you wait for the real revolution, which will be future smart glasses with Android XR on board? Based on what I saw, this is a very impressive tech demo that serves as a foundation for something much greater. It’s a device that feels designed to get developers and early adopters hooked on the Android XR ecosystem. But, in the end, all it’s doing is preparing them for the main event that’s still to come.

PHOTO: GIC Published Oct 22, 2025, 08:44 AM Updated Oct 22, 2025, 05:57 PM London – Deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds are helping drive a resurgence in dealmaking that has taken global merger and acquisition (M&A) volumes past US$3.5 trillion (S$4.5 trillion) in 2025. The M&A volume is now up 34 per cent this year, putting 2025 on track to be the best year since 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than US$1.3 trillion in transactions were recorded in the third quarter, driven by a few mega deals. State-backed funds from the Middle East and Asia, including Singapore, provided firepower for some of 2025’s biggest transactions. Blackstone and TPG agreed on Oct 21 to acquire medical-device maker Hologic for as much as US$18.3 billion including debt, with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia) and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC taking minority stakes. Last week, BlackRock teamed up with Singapore’s investment company Temasek and MGX, an artificial intelligence investment firm set up by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment, on a US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres. US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres The week before, Carlyle Group partnered with Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) to buy control of BASF’s coatings business in a deal valuing the unit at €7.7 billion (S$11.6 billion). It was only in September that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund agreed to take video-game maker Electronic Arts private in a US$55 billion leveraged buyout – the biggest ever. Sovereign wealth funds have been building out their internal deal teams as they seek to do more direct investments, giving them a chance to profit without having to pay fees to Wall Street. They are among the biggest backers of private equity funds, and have squeezed out concessions that force the buyout firms to give them opportunities to invest alongside them in return for the cash they provide. The funds have been particularly active in tech. In August, private equity giant Thoma Bravo got backing from Adia for its roughly US$12 billion acquisition of human-resource software provider Dayforce. Abu Dhabi’s state-backed MGX has invested in OpenAI at a US$500 billion valuation. It has also backed Mr Elon Musk’s xAI and plans to contribute to US President Donald Trump’s Stargate venture. GIC and QIA have put money into rival AI start-up Anthropic. Rainmakers at the top investment banks said they expect the flurry of takeovers to continue. Goldman Sachs Group is predicting a major ramp-up in dealmaking towards the end of 2025, with a chance that 2026 will be a record year for M&A. Sovereign investors are on the hunt for more deals. Mubadala’s asset management arm is exploring an acquisition of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, the billboard operator with a market value of around US$930 million. And they are looking beyond takeovers, with the Qatari sovereign fund joining a more than US$2 billion fundraising for Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel’s new company, alongside other investors like Apollo Global Management and Ares Management Corporation.

Title: MindsEye employees renew allegations that GTA ex-producer Leslie Benzies’ Build a Rocket Boy was chaotic, mismanaged

The MindsEye fallout saga continues as new allegations have surfaced from former employees, detailing years of chaos behind the game's development, which was released in June to poor reviews and criticism that ranged from disappointed users to those that called it 'one of the worst games' they had ever played. Once eagerly watched in part due to Benzies’ role in elevating the Grand Theft Auto series into a cultural icon, Build A Rocket Boy secured over $300 million by 2024 and expanded to 448 employees across offices in Edinburgh, Budapest, and Montpellier. While it was initially focused on the ambitious multiplayer RPG Everywhere, which promised user-generated content in a futuristic open world, the studio shifted gears to MindsEye, which was originally perceived as a tie-in experience within Everywhere. Former employees have painted a grim picture of internal dysfunction, with one staff member, Jamie, who left BARB in 2022, telling the BBC that “Leslie never decided what game he wanted to make,” leading to “no coherent direction” that “plagued the project from the start.” Former lead data analyst, Ben Newbon, spoke about constant “knee-jerk” decisions from upper management, where critical feedback was consistently “ignored and never actioned.” At the same time, Benzies’ micromanagement manifested into what the team started to call “Leslie tickets” or “Leslie bugs.” All direct instructions from Leslie Benzies took precedence over the development team's ongoing work, disrupting teams' ability to manage their own workflows. Margherita “Marg” Peloso, a former associate producer, also chimed in and stated that any attempts to raise concern were “laughed at in meetings with the bosses.” This resulted in a culture where staff members felt “commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return.” A former audio programmer, Isaac Hudd, mentioned how the rapid feature additions requested at the behest of Benzies at “breakneck speed” were too hasty for proper implementation, resulting in regressions where one team’s additions undid another team’s fixes. Hudd further stated, “And it does mess with you. You really do start to see the morale go down, and the little arguments start to happen. People burning the candle at both ends and starting to think: ‘What's the point?’” Earlier this month, between 250 and 300 BARB staff were laid off, most of whom were based in the Edinburgh studio. The IWGB union’s Game Workers Branch, on behalf of the staff members, announced that it would be taking legal action. For its part, Build A Rocket Boy claims in a statement that it would handle the redundancy process with “care and transparency” before mentioning that it was “committed to learning and growing.” In the statement, the studio further detailed, “Leslie and the entire senior management team take full responsibility for MindsEye’s initial launch. The version of the game that was released did not reflect the experience our community deserved.” Despite shipping hotfixes and Update 4 to address bugs and improve gameplay, former staff like Newbon call the whole situation a “wasted” opportunity for Scotland's gaming scene amid industry-wide layoffs, which have exceeded tens of thousands in recent years. The whole MindsEye fiasco has caused the lead actor to fear for future employment, and IO Interactive is taking a break from its third-party publishing ventures.Buy MindsEye on Amazon BBC

Title: CNN In Flux as Warner Bros. Discovery Mulls Sale: ‘People Want This Phase to Be Over’

Pro Available to WrapPRO members With prospective suitors from Comcast to Paramount eyeing CNN’s parent company, network staffers grapple with more uncertainty and hope for a responsible steward rather than a “scavenger” Just days after David Zaslav took the reins of a newly merged Warner Bros. Discovery in April 2022, the chief executive shuttered CNN+, a $300 million streaming subscription service that barely got off the ground. Now, as the network prepares for next week’s launch of its streaming successor, “All Access,” Zaslav dropped more big news on staffers: WBD is for sale. Launching yet another streaming service amid another possible deal marks the latest twist in the CNN ownership saga, as the network has shuffled between corporate parents over the past decade, from Time Warner to the AT&T-owned WarnerMedia, in 2018, to the eventual Warner Bros. Discovery, in 2022. With the prospect of more changes coming, the mood inside CNN on Tuesday, one staffer told TheWrap, “is less concern about who buys us and more about the uncertainty of it all,” adding: “I think people just want to know they’ll have a job.” Such anxiety reflects the shifting stewardship and editorial strategies in recent years at CNN as the groundbreaking linear cable network charts its course in the digital world. Another staffer was more blunt: “People want this phase to be over.” Chatter about WBD selling off CNN alone has only ratcheted up amid the company’s decision to open itself for sale either as a whole or in parts, with Zaslav saying in a memo on Tuesday that “multiple parties” expressed interest in the company. This is separate from its prior plan to split into Warner Bros. (HBO Max, its film and television studios) and networks-and-sports-focused Discovery Global (cable networks including TNT and CNN, among others), and potentially accelerates the chaos to come. It’s just the latest bout of turbulence for CNN, which has seen a string of different CEOs since 2021, from Jeff Zucker to Chris Licht and now Mark Thompson, a former New York Times chief executive whose two-year CNN tenure has been focused on carrying the network into the digital age and who faces his greatest test next week with the “All Access” launch. CNN laid off 200 staffers earlier this year as part of a digital-and-streaming pivot and is banking on cord-cutters’ willingness to pay $6.99 a month for a selection of live and on-demand programming. The second staffer told TheWrap that, while their colleagues have sought some level of stability, they’re more eager to see a buyer who wants to let CNN fulfill its digital ambitions and capitalize on its expertise in international reporting. “I don’t think that the folks that have been in charge — beyond Mark Thompson, the folks that write Mark’s checks — have really had a full vision of what CNN can be and what its mission should be going into the future,” the staffer said. “My aspiration is that whoever comes in and buys us has a set of values that they not only communicate to us, but also to the world, and that they foster an independent journalism that we can be proud of.” A CNN spokesperson referred TheWrap to the WBD memo. Now, the network’s future could hinge on another owner, perhaps a company with a major stake in the news business, such as NBCUniversal parent Comcast, or a streamer like Netflix, both of which are reportedly among the interested parties. WBD’s announcement came after it rejected Paramount’s latest bid to purchase the company wholesale this week, according to the Wall Street Journal. Clearly, Paramount has already demonstrated a willingness to shake up a storied news brand, with newly minted CEO David Ellison quickly installing a conservative think tank veteran as a network watchdog and completing his $150 million purchase of The Free Press, opinion journalist Bari Weiss’ contrarian news outlet. Ellison installed Weiss as CBS News’ editor-in-chief, where she immediately leaned into coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, a subject close to her and Ellison. Expanding his reach into a 24/7 cable news operation like CNN would allow Ellison to tap into its expansive newsgathering operation and synergies (CNN primetime staple Anderson Cooper remains a “60 Minutes” correspondent, and “CBS Mornings” host Gayle King led a short-lived talk show with Charles Barkley between 2023 and 2024) while his own Paramount undergoes layoffs, staving off a potential total brain drain of talent. Should Comcast make a play for the combined Warner Bros. Discovery, they would once again gain a cable news network alongside its own broadcast news operation. Comcast is in the process of spinning off its cable networks, stripping NBC News of its cable counterpart MSNBC and forcing the two networks to move forward as distinct brands and without shared correspondents. Given this, Comcast may only be interested in the Warner Bros. studio assets and its valuable IP, so there’s reason to be skeptical CNN would be included in any deal. A potential Netflix acquisition of the whole company would bring the streamer fully into the news business, something its competitors have only toyed with. The company has said previously it would not enter the breaking news business, but as its scale has grown and its stances on other sectors — sports, ad-supported tiers — have changed, its ability to manage a large-scale news organization could prove more successful than Amazon’s subdued election night program with Brian Williams last year or the streaming components launched by ABC, NBC and CBS for their news programs. It would also give Netflix a new avenue to compete with Amazon, which was reportedly considering other ways to break into news, though Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company’s earnings call Tuesday the company still has “no interest in owning legacy media networks,” so it could be more interested in Warner Bros.’ studio and streaming business on its own. Netflix did not respond to an immediate request for comment. While there’s surely uncertainty about CNN’s future, Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino pointed out Sunday that “for all the talk about declining ratings,” the network is “immensely profitable.” “Now I fully understand the concept of cord cutting etc., but the place has a deep news infrastructure, a global presence and it’s in the middle of a restructuring to [adapt] to changes in the way people view news,” Gasparino said. “Moreover it’s still very relevant. People talk about it all the time. It’s in almost every airport and hotel lobby. I speak to bankers all the time, and they tell me this thing has massive potential, probably more so than the Free Press. Zas knows this.” CNN is currently valued at around $5 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates, based on approximately $750 million in EBITDA, per the company’s earnings reports, and $1.75 billion in revenue at a 6.5 times multiple. For now, the network soldiers on as Warner Bros. Discovery continues its plan to split its streaming and studios businesses from its networks. But it’s that infrastructure and presence the second CNN staffer wants to see maintained should a sale go forward, one that doesn’t include the yearslong series of questions about what its corporate owners want to do with the 45-year-old news organization. “I hate to evoke Jeff Zucker, because that’s in the past, but when we had a different sort of corporate structure and we had Jeff Zucker in charge, we never heard anything about Time Warner or AT&T,” they said. “That stuff was so beyond anything that impacted us day to day, where now we’ve had, over the last few years, a consistent drumbeat of speculation and analysis about how our corporate ownership looks at us, what they want out of us, how they’re building a strategy around us. From the day that we were purchased, there was a conversation about whether we would be merged down the road, and questions about strategy more broadly, and I don’t think that that helps the process.” The staffer said a new suitor should want to honor CNN’s legacy of reporting, and appreciate its “enormous value if they let us do good work.” “My fear is that, given the landscape, there’s a good chance that a scavenger comes along and rides the wave of cable disintegration and irrelevance and either dismantles us for parts or merges us with something that already has a lot of redundancies and that we see CNN dwindle into irrelevance,” the staffer said.

Title: Amazon Plans to Replace 600,000 Human Workers With Robots, Report Says
URL: https://www.cnet.com/tech/amazon-plans-to-replace-600000-human-workers-with-robots-report-says/

The retail giant has used robots in its warehouses for years, but it appears that the company is ramping up in a big way. Amazon may use robots to displace warehouse workers in big numbers. Amazon has been using robots in its warehouses for over a decade, and that's not stopping anytime soon. According to a report Monday from The New York Times, Amazon is seeking to ramp up its robot army at the cost of human jobs. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. The Times reports that internal Amazon documents suggest that the company is looking into building and using more robots to replace human workers. The publication doesn't specify if this will result in massive layoffs. However, the robots would allow Amazon to avoid hiring new workers to meet increasing demand, translating to 600,000 jobs replaced by 2033, according to the report. The report also says the company wants to mitigate the fallout in communities that may lose jobs. Documents show the company has considered building an image as a "good corporate citizen" through greater participation in community events such as local parades and Toys for Tots. And the leaked documents discuss avoiding using terms like automation and AI, instead using terms such as "advanced technology," and replacing the word "robot" with "cobot" to suggest collaboration. "Leaked documents often paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans, and that's the case here," an Amazon spokesperson told CNET in an email. "In this instance, the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines -- now or moving forward." The spokesperson said "no company has created more jobs in America over the past decade than Amazon" and that the company is actively hiring at operations facilities, with plans to fill 250,000 positions for the holiday season. Amazon is the third biggest employer in the US, behind the federal government and Walmart. To date, the company employs an estimated 1.5 million employees, most of whom work in warehouses or as delivery drivers. Only a handful of companies in the US have more than 600,000 employees on the payroll. Delivery company FedEx has an estimated 550,000 employees. A reduction of the size reported by The Times would be akin to FedEx disappearing entirely. Studies have been done on the impact of robots on human wages. As of 2020, every robot added by a company per 1,000 workers reduces US wages by 0.42% and has cost humans an estimated 400,000 jobs. "Our investments will continue to create substantial employment, emphasizing higher-paying positions," Amazon said in an email. "In particular, and as mentioned in The New York Times story, efficiency gains in one area enable us to invest in other areas -- both existing and entirely new ones -- that create additional value for customers. While it's difficult to predict the future precisely, our track record demonstrates that we've consistently been a major job creator while simultaneously investing in upskilling our workforce for evolving roles."

Title: The 3 Best Growth Stocks To Buy For November 2025

Time Published: 2025-10-21T21:30:02Z

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Applied Digital is a rapidly expanding AI data center operator, securing large contracts and building new capacity to meet soaring demand.Broadcom is a strong contender in AI infrastructure, providing innovative, cost-effective custom AI chips that outperform competitors.Eli Lilly dominates the booming diabetes- and obesity-drug markets with blockbuster products and has a robust pipeline of new treatments. It's tough to say for sure which growth stocks will be winners without a crystal ball. But investors may wish to consider investing in AI data center operator Applied Digital, AI semiconductor provider Broadcom and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. These three companies have solid prospects for gains in addition to some better-known companies, such as Nvidia and Palantir. Applied Digital, Broadcom and Lilly have the potential to rise in the short and long term. If they beat earnings targets and raise guidance, their share prices will keep rising. If they tap their strong competitive positions to win more market share, they'll see lasting success. These stocks were selected based on their rapid growth, good chance of exceeding expectations, and strong products and management. If a company is growing rapidly now and has a track record of beating expectations, its stock is likely to rise. However, to sustain those increases over time, a company must innovate. If the company has great products and excellent management, better-than-expected growth is more likely to last. The three best growth stocks are ranked below in descending order of their stock price change in 2025 as of Oct. 21. More generally, the three stocks are ranked from the highest to lowest return and risk. Read on to learn why. Although it is not profitable, Applied Digital has grown rapidly. In the company's first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenue increased 84% to $64.2 million, exceeding analyst expectations by $14.2 million, CNBC reported. Applied Digital is benefiting from soaring demand for AI data centers. An estimated $350 billion will be spent in 2025 by large cloud services providers called hyperscalers. CoreWeave – a leading AI cloud services provider – recently leased 150 megawatts of Applied Digital’s Polaris Forge 1 campus, bringing Applied Digital’s total anticipated contracted lease revenue to about $11 billion over 15 years, CNBC also reported. Strong demand for Applied Digital’s services looks likely to continue at least through 2026. That's one reason, the company is building a 200 megawatt Polaris Forge 2 campus and is in “advanced discussions with hyperscalers,” according to CRN, with management projecting leased capacity for both Applied Digital campuses as high as 600 MW. Broadcom is benefiting from demand for AI infrastructure. In the company’s third quarter of fiscal year 2025, AI semiconductor revenue grew 53% to $5.2 billion. The company is also gaining from a shift in AI chip architecture through Broadcom’s 65% revenue share of application-specific integrated circuits for hyperscalers, according to Ainvest. Broadcom provides hyperscalers with AI chips that deliver faster performance at lower prices than Nvidia’s products. The chip provider’s clients include Google, Meta, ByteDance and reportedly OpenAI, “representing a strategic alternative to purchasing Nvidia's GPUs," CNBC said. More specifically, Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators deliver three to five times better performance-per-watt than Nvidia GPUs at a roughly $20,000 to $15,000 lower per unit cost, Datagravity estimated. Such innovation has enabled Broadcom to exceed Wall Street expectations for eight consecutive quarters, typically resulting in 10% to 20% stock increases on earnings-announcement days, Ainvest reported. Broadcom’s stock price could rise in November. A September announcement of a $10 billion order for the Titan AI inference chip from a fourth hyperscale customer— believed to be OpenAI —demonstrates Broadcom is winning new hyperscale customers. Though this program is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, pre-production revenue and additional design wins could emerge in fourth-quarter 2025 results, Tom's Hardware predicted. Eli Lilly is an American pharmaceutical company combining strong profitability and rapid growth with its market-leading diabetes and obesity treatments. Lilly’s latest financial results, in the second quarter of 2025 showed that revenue rose 38% to $15.56 billion, with net income increasing 91% to nearly $6.7 billion, according to a company release. Lilly dominates the market for diabetes and weight loss drugs. More specifically, Lilly controls about 57% of the U.S. market for incretins – enjoying a competitive advantage over rival Novo Nordisk, Reuters reported. Lilly has experienced rapid growth in demand for two drugs: Mounjaro, which helps manage blood-sugar levels in adults with diabetes, and Zepbound, for treating obesity and weight-related conditions. In Q2, sales of these products grew 68% to $5.2 billion for Mounjaro and 172% to nearly $3.4 billion for Zepbound. The company communicated its optimism about future growth, raising its full-year 2025 guidance above Wall Street expectations. It's projecting $60 billion to $62 billion in revenue and EPS between $21.75 and $23.00 amid strong demand. A new obesity treatment called retatrutide, which is expected to report positive trial results late in 2025, provides another reason for optimism, Pharmaceutical-Journal noted. Moreover, An Alzheimer’s therapy called donanemab, sold under the brand name Kisunla, was approved in 2025 and could help Lilly exceed investor’s revenue expectations. Investors looking for stocks with upside potential may consider betting on shares of Applied Digital, Broadcom and Eli Lilly. While Applied Digital is losing money and investing to build capacity, its rapid revenue growth and feverish demand from hyperscalers makes it a compelling short-term investment. Broadcom is a much larger, profitable beneficiary of AI chip demand while Lilly’s commanding lead in the booming markets for treatment of diabetes and obesity is propelling rapid growth, which could be even faster if the company shares positive results from new drug trials.

Hyman is an economist and financial analyst specializing in the energy sector. He headed utility equity research at a major brokerage house and… More Info Here is a funny thing about valuation “bubbles” involving financial instruments. In every individual case, you unavoidably end up asking: "What were they thinking?” Or stated differently, what causes a significant part of the supposedly rational investing public to collectively lose their minds for a relatively brief period? A few tulip bulbs, for example, were valued more highly than a modest Amsterdam house in 1637, until they weren’t. Leveraged speculation in frontier commodity markets of Asia and America led to the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Bubble in Europe in the 1720s. The seventeenth and eighteenth-century bubbles were commodity bubbles: tulips, spices, or beaver pelts. But the Railway Mania in the UK in the mid-1840s focused on an amazing new technology, railroads, marketed to the public as risk-free investments. That the British railroad companies' shares ultimately soared and then lost more than two-thirds of their value, immiserating a large portion of the investing public, is almost besides the point. Bubbles always end badly by definition. But the UK’s railway mania is instructive because it was the first truly modern bubble which had all three components of more recent financial bubbles: 1) a new technology, railroads for moving goods and people, the long term economic impacts of which are unclear; 2) financial innovation usually involving leverage or speculation and 3) a government that either participates in the scheme or has little inclination to intervene in financial markets (until it’s too late). Related: Tanker Explosion Off Yemen Deepens Red Sea Security Fears for LPG Trade Using this as a framework, it seems fair to ask if today’s AI stocks, which have substantially outperformed broad market indices, are in a financial bubble? But we’re utility analysts asking this question for a simple reason. The demands for new electric power-generating facilities supposedly required by AI are simply staggering both in amount and expense. For example, the highly respected Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) expects new AI-related electricity demand to reach 50 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. A Deloitte study showed AI electric demand increasing from 4GW now to 123 GW by 2035. And Sam Altman’s Open AI Consortium (including Softbank and Oracle) stated it would need roughly 250 GW by 2033, which at today’s prices would cost over half a trillion bucks to build. (To put these numbers in context, total generating capacity in the USA, presently, is 1,300 GW, growing about 30 GW per year.) All we can say is that with respect to power costs, the AI industry is behaving as if they are either irrelevant or simply a modest expense item, neither of which is true. Utility assets and AI data centers resemble each other in that both are highly capital-intensive, but with one big difference. The heart of a utility is a power plant that lasts forty years (an annual depreciation rate of 2.5%). The primary cost component of a data center is the vast array of computer chips, which have a relatively short life, maybe 2-3 years. A capital asset with a two-year life has a 50% depreciation rate, creating a very large expense item on the income statement, which has to be covered by revenues from the business or by increased corporate borrowing. That still doesn’t make the AI/data center boom a bubble, but it does suggest our next concern. Capital expenditures for AI and data centers seem high. Not just to us. In fact, economists have noted that in the first half of 2025, AI-related capital expenditures contributed more to US domestic growth than consumer spending. This marks a dramatic reversal of prior trends, where consumer spending has been responsible for the bulk of economic activity. All we can conclude here is that this highlights the biggest financial risk for AI investors: will all these new facilities earn a competitive return on all this new, invested capital? Will there be enough revenues to support these new assets? We know the level of planned capex and that there are exciting uses for this technology. We do not know how much people will pay for these services, and therein lies a huge risk. This boom (bubble?) reminds us of the power-generating bubble that burst in the early days of the century. When the power generating market was opened to competition, a host of legacy electricity firms, bankers, entrepreneurs, pipelines, European utilities, and crooks piled in to build a multitude of power plants, encouraged by favorable forward price curves and plenty of low-cost borrowed money. They knew that all the construction (if completed) would produce a power glut, but they all believed that the other guy would back down and not build, thereby preventing an oversupply. Well, the other guys did not back down, demand for power was weak, and carnage followed. There are other related risks here, such as the role of vendor financing. The biggest players in this area (Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Nvidia) are financially robust. But they support an ecosystem of smaller vendors and suppliers who rely exclusively for their infrastructure and software on the aforementioned giants. This creates a circular financing scheme where one group sells products to another wholly captive or financially dependent group while purchasing their services. In a bubble, this is all financed with common stock issuances at ever higher valuations. Which works until it doesn’t. Then the house of cards falls down, as it did in the housing and dot-com bubbles earlier this century. The AI boom assumes that the tech bros in California, choosing an AI strategy, picked the right horse. The Chinese seem to think otherwise, offering less expensive AI solutions to less expensive problems, more or less. Chinese industry has shown, with government help, a remarkable ability to take ideas from abroad and commercialize them into a lower-cost product. AI is in their targets. That may put these huge American AI investments at risk. So don’t start to count the profits. Let’s conclude with these observations about financial bubbles. First, there is a kind of conflation in the term between genuinely nonsensical ideas and those viable corporations whose shares were simply grossly misvalued. When the dot-com bubble burst around the year 2000, the shares of Amazon declined by over 90%. But it is still around, bigger than ever. Pet food supplier Pets.com, on the other hand, which lost money on every sale, is not. If we go back to our original example of the British railway mania of the 1840s, we can observe something similar. Those railroads, which provided an enormous economic boost to a rapidly industrializing British economy, also caused grievous financial injury to a generation of investors because of the wild misvaluation of the fledgling industry employing a radically new technology, the steam engine. But the legacy of that technology bubble was a fully functioning national railway system that still exists. So, after this AI and data center investor euphoria passes, the investors lose their money and the smoke lifts, what remains, just ashes or many valuable, profitable, important businesses?

Title: Trump rebukes “young lady” reporter questioning Argentina bailout as farmers rips his beef deal
URL: https://www.dailydot.com/viral-politics/trump-backlash-beef-trade-deal-argentina/
Time Published: 2025-10-21T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
Rachel Kiley President Donald Trump is facing renewed backlash for his support of Argentina following a tone deaf comment he made about a potential beef trade deal with the country. Trump has been publicly mulling over the possibility of beginning to import beef from Argentina as a way to bring down prices at U.S. grocery stores. “If we buy some beef now—I’m not talking about that much—from Argentina, it would help Argentina, which we consider a very good country, a very good ally,” he said over the weekend. No deal has officially been made as of yet, but even the idea of it is causing an uproar among farmers who already feel betrayed and misled by the allegedly “America First” president. A reporter recently questioned Trump about this backlash, asking, “What do you have to say to U.S. farmers who feel that the deal is benefiting Argentina more than it does them—” “Look, Argentina’s fighting for its life, young lady,” he said, cutting her off. “You don’t know anything about it. They’re fighting for their life.” He went on to claim that “nothing’s benefiting Argentina” and that he wants to “help them survive in a free world,” before letting his true motivation slip. “I happen to like the president of Argentina,” he said. “I think he’s trying to do the best he can. But don’t make it sound like they’re doing great. They’re dying, alright? They’re dying.” The reporter’s identity could not immediately be confirmed. Q: What do you have to say to farmers who feel that the deal is benefitting Argentina more than it is them?TRUMP: Look, Argentina is fighting for its life, young lady. You don’t know anything about it. You understand what that means? They are dying pic.twitter.com/1DMyaHtcTR Trade wars have led to China, previously the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, halting its purchases. Instead, they’re now getting soybeans from Brazil and Argentina. Adding insult to injury, the Trump administration has authorized a $20 billion currency swap for Argentina while U.S. farmers continue to struggle. And Trump himself has repeatedly made it clear that this help is motivated by his ideological allyship with Argentina’s president, Javier Milei. “Just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” he recently said, while warning U.S. financial support for the country would drop if Argentinian politics shift left. Putting this relationship and Argentina’s economy above struggling Americans has angered some farmers, with many worrying that creating a beef deal with Argentina will only exacerbate an already bad situation for rural Americans. “President Trump’s plan to buy beef from Argentina is a betrayal of the American rancher,” Farm Action’s Senior Director of Programs, Christian Lovell, said in a press release. “The U.S. beef industry is dominated by four major meatpackers that control roughly 85% of the market. This consolidation allows them to suppress prices paid to ranchers while keeping consumer prices high. Importing more beef into this rigged system will not lower costs for families or restore fair markets for producers.” As frustrated as farmers may be, there’s been a fair amount of frustration aimed at them from other Americans, as well, considering many of them voted for him despite being warned that it would hurt the economy and their own bottom line. Still, that doesn’t mean people are keen on Trump throwing money at Argentina while gutting American programs—or that anyone was impressed by his condescending response to the reporter who actually asked him about it. The tone of “young lady” here then calling the reporter stupid is quite the combo https://t.co/dC6GDoDXts it’s quite funny that argentina’s current situation is a direct result of Milei’s policy. Farmers: We’re struggling. Trump: Okay, but have you tried being Argentina?MAGA farmers voted for the guy who bankrupted casinos, and they’re shocked he’s bankrupting them too. https://t.co/4Rw1LVBB8c I think the media should be doing a better job of explaining that Argentina is “fighting for it’s life” because they followed right wing policies which caused their economy to collapse. https://t.co/g2sxwYlaKY Why would Trump buy beef from Argentina while US farmers struggle?Maybe it’s because the Trump-connected fund managers at BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco, and his mega-wealthy friends are heavily invested in Argentina.Always follow the money and you’ll find Trump’s corruption. https://t.co/4SM5nFaP4q Just found out that the first A in MAGA stands for Argentina.

Title: Millionaire tax that inspired Mamdani fuels $5.7 billion haul in Massachusetts
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/21/zohran-mamdani-millionaire-tax-massachusetts-5-7-billion/
Time Published: 2025-10-21T17:43:25Z
Full Content:
A millionaire levy in Massachusetts that New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani holds up as a model for taxing the rich has generated $3 billion more in revenue than expected without forcing significant high-profile departures from the state. In the two years since the state started charging a 4% surtax on incomes over $1 million, the effort has created a $5.7 billion windfall, with the surplus being used to fund bridge repairs, bolster literacy programs and address the transportation system’s budget deficit. While other states have progressive tax brackets, the Massachusetts law stands out structurally in its targeting of incomes that exceed seven figures. That has infuriated business leaders who complain it makes the state less competitive and drives away the wealthy. Several are even backing ballot proposals to lower the state income levy and limit how much tax revenue can be collected in any given year as a way to diffuse the millionaire’s fee. Some high-profile names have moved away, including Robert Reynolds, the former chief executive officer of Putnam Investments. But other anecdotes of bold-faced names or companies ditching Massachusetts are harder to come by, in contrast to tales of departures from New York, Chicago and San Francisco. That may change as more Internal Revenue Service data is released in the coming months, potentially bolstering the case for the tax or providing evidence of how it can undermine a state’s appeal to the wealthy. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu — whom Mamdani has called a role model — recently chastised executives for complaining about the tax. She contends that the region’s talent pool and livability are more important to its economic competitiveness. Many high-income taxpayers are staying in the Boston area despite the tax hike. “At the end of the day, I happen to believe it’s a phenomenal place to live,” said Sam Slater, a real estate developer who lives in the Boston suburb of Weston and pays the millionaire’s tax. Slater, 41, could live anywhere: His real estate firm has holdings nationwide. He travels frequently for his side job producing films starring big names like Mark Wahlberg. His holdings including a piece of the National Hockey League’s Seattle Kraken. He even spent part of his childhood in West Palm Beach, Florida, a favorite refuge for wealthy executives looking to flee high taxes and winters. But he’s staying put. His family has roots in the region, and they also like Boston’s culture, sports teams and seasons, Slater said. Josh Isner, president of taser manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc., said the millionaire’s tax makes it harder to recruit talent — particularly well-paid artificial intelligence specialists — to the Northeast hub the company opened in Boston last year. But the office is based in the city because “Boston breeds super-talented people,” he said earlier this year. He lives in Massachusetts, rather than near the company’s headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, where income taxes are significantly lower. That’s largely because Massachusetts schools are so renowned, he said. Massachusetts voters approved the surtax in 2022, with the levy applying to income that exceeds the $1 million threshold. Mamdani, who has maintained a large lead in polls ahead of New York’s Nov. 4 mayoral election, cited the Massachusetts policy as a success story when he floated his own millionaire’s tax proposal. New York may prove different than Massachusetts. The Empire State already ranks dead last in the Tax Foundation’s competitiveness index with rates that are among the highest in the country. And while Mamdani has used billionaires as a foil in his campaign — he wants to raise levies on individuals and corporations to pay for his progressive agenda — Governor Kathy Hochul has ruled out approving increases. In Massachusetts, with a buoyant stock market helping to swell wealthy residents’ taxable wealth, the millionaire’s tax generated an estimated $3 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, more than double what state lawmakers had budgeted, according to the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. Collections a year earlier similarly exceeded expectations. The surtax has generated $5.7 billion in total. The extra cash has helped Governor Maura Healey ease the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s budget gap at a time when other states are slashing train and bus service. Healey’s now seeking to use $200 million of the money to address President Donald Trump’s cuts to research funding at Massachusetts institutions, one of the biggest threats to the state’s economy. The law that created the tax requires the funds to go toward education and transportation initiatives. “People who thought this tax would backfire will have to concede now that it generates a substantial amount of additional revenue,” said Evan Horowitz, executive director of Tufts University’s Center for State Policy Analysis. Still, he estimates that for every dollar the millionaire’s tax brings in, the state is likely to lose 20 to 50 cents in income taxes from those who leave or adopt tax-avoidance strategies. Those indirect losses are hard to pinpoint, he said. Individuals with incomes over $1 million were responsible for 35% of total payments in Massachusetts in 2022, the year before the millionaire’s tax took effect and the most recent period for which IRS data is available. Some high-profile executives have indeed decamped for lower-tax states because of the surcharge. Reynolds, the former Putnam Investments CEO, cited the combination of the millionaire’s tax and the Massachusetts estate tax. He moved to Florida last year, shortly after Franklin Templeton acquired Boston-based Putnam. The surtax “pushes you to make an earlier decision,” Reynolds said. The 73-year-old finance executive has been a fixture in Boston business circles for decades, having built Fidelity Investments’ 401(k) business before joining Putnam in 2008. He remains on the board of the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, a collection of the state’s most powerful executives. Business leaders continue to warn that even if wealthy residents didn’t abandon the state in droves in the tax’s first years, the departures will add up over time — and ultimately hurt Massachusetts more than it helps. They point out that $1 million incomes don’t go as far as they used to, particularly in a high-cost state like Massachusetts. The median home price in the greater Boston area surpassed $1 million in June before falling back under that threshold again. “I haven’t been to one meeting in Boston since this passed where there haven’t been a number of people saying that they’re moving out of the state,” Reynolds said. Other high-profile Massachusetts residents who have moved are reluctant to blame the tax. Steve Pagliuca, a longtime Bain Capital executive and Boston Celtics co-owner, has said his recent move to Florida was due to family reasons and his retirement from day-to-day work at Bain, not the tax. He recently offered to acquire the Connecticut Sun women’s professional basketball team and relocate it to Boston. In the absence of clear data, supporters and critics of the millionaire’s tax alike have touted studies that support their arguments — even if they don’t tell the full story. A study by a progressive research organization found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts jumped by 39% from 2022 to 2024, with the authors concluding the surtax is an effective policy tool. The report’s data measured wealth, however, not the income figures that determine who is subject to the tax. A separate survey conducted by a business advocacy group this year found that tax policy was the most-cited reason for residents’ moves elsewhere. Few of those surveyed are subject to the millionaire’s tax, though. The outflow of residents to other states also predates the surtax and reflects other factors such as high housing costs. Slater, the real estate developer, has friends who left Massachusetts for places like Florida and Texas — both because of the millionaire’s tax and for other reasons. While he has no plans to follow them, he’s concerned Massachusetts could increase the surcharge or add other taxes in the future. New increases have been on the table this year. Raise Up Massachusetts, the labor-backed group that proposed the millionaire’s tax, is now pushing to increase state duties on corporate foreign income. Healey also proposed new taxes on candy, prescription drugs and synthetic nicotine products — levies that the state legislature ultimately rejected. Should Massachusetts tax wealthy individuals further, Slater said he can’t say with certainty he’d stick around. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Hopefully this will cut nVidia’s extremely ridiculous prices down within our stratosphere. AMD stock went from about $164 on Oct 3rd to today at $238 AMD deal with OpenAI predict $600 a share maybe in 4 years... 😁 I’ve had 2 ATI Radeon in the past 20 years, and they both failed within a week. I haven’t had one since AMD took it over, but if nVidia won’t drop their prices to a reasonable level, I may have to try again with Radeon. As for motherboards, the last Intel I had was in 1998, when I first got to Japan, since was the only one available at the time. I only build my computers with AMD motherboards and CPUs.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Historically, Nvidia has staged multiple powerful rallies - from riding the cryptocurrency boom to capitalizing on the Covid-era gaming and remote work surge. The stock’s latest ascent, fueled by the generative AI revolution that began in 2022 has been the biggest and most transformative wave in the company’s history. In fact, the stock increased by more than 50% within a two-month period on 11 occasions, particularly notable in 2016 and 2024, and rose over 30% during similar times 15 times, including crucial years such as 2017 and 2024. If past patterns persist, forthcoming catalysts could propel NVIDIA shares sharply upward once more, providing considerable profits to investors. Factors That May Elevate The Stock Investing in single stocks can be risky, but there is immense value in a broader, diversified strategy such as the one we implement with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend our focus beyond just stocks. A portfolio consisting of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% cryptocurrency, in addition to stocks and bonds, may yield higher returns over the next 1 to 3 years and offer better protection if markets decline by 20%. We have analyzed the data. Current Financial Overview It's beneficial if the fundamentals align well. For insights on NVDA, read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock. Below are several important figures. But How Does The Stock Perform During Adverse Conditions? Examining NVIDIA’s past during market downturns reveals that there remains considerable risk despite its advantages. The stock declined close to 85% during the Global Financial Crisis and 68% during the Dot-Com bust. The sell-off in 2018 and the inflation shock each exhibited decreases exceeding 55%, with the latter around 66%. Even the relatively short Covid downturn caused a nearly 38% drop in the stock. Strong fundamentals are important, but when the market declines, NVDA is not shielded from significant drops. However, risk is not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions—consider events like earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Read NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines historically. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a selection of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices—the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What accounts for this? Collectively, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have offered better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a steadier performance, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Earnings Preview: From Disney’s Kimmel Fallout to Paramount-WBD Drama, Our 5 Biggest Questions

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Expect fresh insight into linear and streaming as several big industry shifts are poised to play out over the coming quarters The final round of quarterly earnings updates for 2025 kick off with Netflix earnings on Tuesday afternoon, followed by Comcast next week and Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount and Disney in November. The financials will paint the latest picture on where these companies stand as they look to grow streaming profitability amid linear TV’s continued decline. Executives will also have the opportunity to address several major shifts set to take place across the media landscape in the coming quarters, including increased competition from YouTube, the copyright implications from OpenAI’s Sora 2, Comcast’s spin off of its cable network portfolio into Versant and David Ellison’s new vision for Paramount as the company pursues a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which said on Tuesday its fielding interest from “multiple parties” for all or part of its business. “We were finally beginning to settle into a position where Netflix has won the streaming wars. It just feels like things are being thrown into flux again,” Third Bridge analyst John Conca told TheWrap. “We’re in a time of disruption.” Disney, Comcast and Paramount declined to comment on this story. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. Here are five questions we hope to get more answers to as earnings season kicks off. After ending its quarterly disclosures at the end of 2024, Wall Street will be paying close attention to Netflix’s guidance around engagement, which has become the streamer’s new metric of success as it looks to scale its ad tier. Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese told TheWrap that Netflix is finally at a turning point where the company’s ad tier is poised to become a primary revenue driver in 2026. She noted that Wedbush’s quarterly consumer survey indicates “pretty strong stability” in Netflix subscriber growth. “The retention is largely due to their ad supported tier,” she said. “They have the lowest ad delivery rates of anyone in streaming and I think their ads are becoming more and more relevant as they get better at targeting. That will only get better over time.” UBS analyst John Hodulik expects a 17% increase in revenue and 25% increase in operating income as a result of subscriber growth, higher pricing and increased ad revenues. He believes the return of shows like “Squid Game” and “Wednesday,” as well as new hits like “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Untamed,” will provide a boost to engagement and monetization. He expects that trend to continue with its fourth-quarter slate, which includes “The Witcher,” “Stranger Things” and the NFL Christmas Day games. Netflix will also add video podcasts to its platform in 2026 as part of a new partnership with Spotify, so expect to hear some commentary around that. Though Netflix itself has also been floated as a potential WBD suitor, J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth emphasized its “certainly not an acquisitive company” and added that a large, complex deal would “likely bog the company down for an extended period of time and potentially invite regulatory scrutiny.” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters also shaded big media mergers earlier this month, noting they “don’t have an amazing track record.” Disney will report its first earnings results since its temporary suspension of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on ABC and affiliates owned by Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcasting. The move, which came in response to the late night host’s comments about Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin, triggered calls to cancel Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ subscriptions. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich expects Kimmel to have “little impact” on streaming churn in the quarter given the timing of billing cycles, though she predicted there could be a “modest” impact in Disney’s first fiscal quarter of 2026. On the advertising side, Seaport Research’s David Joyce estimated the Kimmel situation could have resulted in a $4.25 million hit, assuming a $30 average cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM) and 1.77 million average viewers, but acknowledged that could be easily recouped. Antenna revealed on Monday that the monthly churn rate for Disney+ and Hulu doubled in September to 5% and 10%, respectively, though it’s unclear how much of that was related directly to Kimmel. An insider told TheWrap that Antenna’s percentages are higher than what Disney is seeing internally. “Disney ultimately, and effectively we believe, resolved its controversies over the past couple of weeks, but the immediate follow-on with planned streaming price increases might compound the cancellations and put the +10 [million] net adds guidance at risk — but not likely by a wide margin,” Joyce said. Notably, ESPN+ will no longer report its subscriber and average revenue per user metrics starting this quarter, with Disney+ and Hulu set to follow suit in the company’s first quarter of 2026. An Antenna spokesperson told TheWrap that the estimated cancellation volumes for Disney+ and Hulu totaled 3 million and 4.1 million, compared to the averages of 1.2 million and 1.9 million, respectively, in the last three months. Disney+ had around 2.18 million sign-ups during the month, while Hulu had just over 2.1 million sign-ups, per Antenna. In addition to Kimmel, Wall Street will be paying close attention to any additional financial guidance for 2026, as well as commentary around Disney CEO succession updates, its new ESPN streamer and its impact on cord-cutting, the efforts to combine Disney+ and Hulu into a standalone app in 2026, the financial impact of its NBA rights renewal and loss of F1 rights, the outlook for their linear business, recent price hikes at their U.S. theme parks and the impact from competition with Universal’s Epic Universe. Ellison will finally take questions from Wall Street after the closing of Skydance Media’s $8 billion merger as he and president Jeff Shell outline their vision and provide updates on the company’s efforts to achieve $2 billion in cost savings. Those efforts include thousands of upcoming layoffs which are expected to kick off as soon as next week, a review of its real estate portfolio and finding efficiencies in other areas such as procurement and workflow. Leadership also said they would look to transform Paramount into a technological leader in entertainment, with plans to use tools like virtual production and AI, as well as leverage Skydance’s existing relationship with Larry Ellison’s Oracle and move Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ to a unified tech stack next year. Additionally the company has been investing more in content, setting new media rights deals with the UFC and Zuffa Boxing, new series such as Jeremy Strong’s “9/12” and Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning’s “Discretion,” and striking deals with“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, The Duffer Brothers and James Mangold. “It will probably be a few quarters before we really have a good idea of what this vision truly is,” Conca said. “It’s exciting and invigorating that we have seen them make the moves that they’ve made so far, but we don’t know where this might all end up going.” Analysts will also have an opportunity to ask Paramount about its pursuit of all of Warner Bros. Discovery and larger M&A strategy on the heels of its $150 million purchase of Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. When asked during Bloomberg’s Screentime conference, Ellison dodged talk about the WBD bid, but said he sees “a lot” of “actionable” M&A possibilities in the near-term. “We would approach that through the lens of wanting to make more, not less,” Ellison said. Conca says he’ll also be looking for specifics around Paramount’s content spend, how a WBD acquisition may or may not change the plans for holding onto its linear networks and the timeline for ramping up its content production on the film side. Speaking of Warner Bros. Discovery, the company revealed on Tuesday that it has launched a review of strategic alternatives after “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties” for both the entire company and Warner Bros., its streaming and studios business that will separate from its linear networks business Discovery Global in April. The review comes as WBD reportedly rejected a $20 per share takeover bid from Paramount for being too low. Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield noted that, assuming the lowest price the WBD board is willing to entertain is $25 per share, the Ellisons could pay around $63 billion with $50 billion in cash, though he doesn’t believe they’d be interested in that option. They could also write a $30 billion check for WBD and raise $20 billion in new debt, along with issuing $12 billion to $13 billion of new Paramount stock to WBD shareholders. Additionally, analysts will be looking for any further guidance around HBO Max’s efforts to grow revenue, profitability and subscribers through its ongoing international expansion and looming password sharing crackdown, as well as the impact of WBD’s loss of its NBA rights to Amazon, NBCUniversal and Disney. Though it wasn’t included in the larger group, Warner notably reached a settlement with the league that will give TNT Sports and its portfolio of brands a global license to create, produce and distribute new and existing NBA content across its platforms, as well as international rights in Northern Europe and Latin America, excluding Mexico and Brazil. Morningstar Research analyst Matthew Dolgin told TheWrap it’s too soon to tell what the overall impact of the NBA loss will be, but that it’s an area he’ll be keeping an eye on. “Their recent pay TV renewals should keep the subscription line steady for now, but the extent of ad revenue declines and cash savings over the next couple of quarters will be important,” Dolgin said. Though many analysts have viewed Comcast as an ideal merger partner for WBD for years, the company faces difficulty in getting a deal done given its upcoming spin off of Versant, as well as the required financing for a competing bid against the world’s second richest man and potential regulatory hurdles from the Trump administration. “I would be very surprised if they were to get involved at this point. It seems like Paramount has the appetite to absorb both and then maybe deal with it later. I don’t see Comcast wanting to do that, at least as of now,” Conca said. “If we’re sitting here a year from now and there’s a full Warner Bros. Discovery unwinding and they’re spun off, I could see Comcast maybe getting involved for the studio piece and Versant getting involved for the cable networks, but I don’t see that now as they’re going through their own organizational reshuffle.” On the flip side, Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino believes that Comcast should “try hard to buy it,” arguing it would have “much to gain” and that it could “fix NBCU’s ~$30B undervaluation.” Supino said Comcast could get around the political and financing challenges by issuing new stock to WBD, eliminating its “super voting” share structure and appointing a new chairman and CEO given Trump’s repeated criticism of Brian Roberts. (Comcast recently announced it would elevate Comcast president Mike Cavanagh to co-CEO alongside Roberts, though the latter said the pair would work together for “years to come.”) He added that NBCU could sweeten its bid with a position for WBD CEO David Zaslav in the combined company. Outside of the WBD bid conversation, analysts will keep an eye out for any positive momentum for Comcast’s broadband business, which has suffered declines in recent quarters due to increased competition, and any further guidance that can be shared about Versant’s outlook. In a first glimpse at its financials ahead of the spin off, Comcast disclosed that Versant’s profits fell 16% to $670 million and revenue fell 6% to $3.42 billion in the first half of 2025. They’ll also be paying close attention to Peacock’s growth and how its recent price increase and NBCUniversal’s new 11-year media rights deal with the NBA may impact its profitability efforts. “With the NBA contract beginning in this year’s fourth quarter, I don’t think third quarter sales, subscribers or profits can be expected to be a trend,” Dolgin said. “We’ll need to wait until next year to see if the NBA is bearing fruit and allowing for a better outlook for Peacock, which we’ve seen as the laggard.”

Title: RKLB Stock To $48?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab stock (NASDAQ: RKLB) has seen a rapid appreciation, jumping 41% over the past month to a current trading price of $67. This surge is likely fueled by several positive developments: improved analyst ratings, higher price targets, and new or expanded launch contracts with Japanese clients. A significant factor is the growing consensus among analysts who now see Rocket Lab as a serious, publicly traded competitor to SpaceX. Despite these strong operational tailwinds and the company’s solid long-term prospects, our machine-driven multi-factor assessment suggests reducing exposure to RKLB stock may be prudent. Our primary concern stems from the stock’s Very High valuation. While Rocket Lab boasts a Strong overall operating performance and financial condition, the recent rapid run-up appears to have factored in most of the near-term positive news. Consequently, the stock is currently deemed Relatively Expensive. Below is our assessment: RKLB stock has jumped meaningfully recently, and we currently find it relatively expensive. While this may feel like an opportunity, there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. Consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Let's get into details of each of the assessed factors but before that, for quick background: With $35 Bil in market cap, Rocket Lab provides launch services and space systems solutions, designing and manufacturing small orbital launch vehicles and satellite platforms for commercial, aerospace, and government customers. This table highlights how RKLB is valued vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Valuation Ratios This table highlights how RKLB is growing vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Revenue Comparison This table highlights how RKLB profitability vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Operating Income Comparison RKLB saw an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, outlook changes. Read RKLB Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Adobe Stock Pricing Powerhouse Now 38% Cheaper, Buy?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/21/adobe-stock-pricing-powerhouse-now-38-cheaper-buy/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock merits your attention. Why? Because it offers monopoly-like high margins at a discounted price. Here are some details. While revenue growth is beneficial, this is not solely a growth viewpoint. Pricing power and high margins yield consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, decreasing risk and facilitating reinvestment of capital. The market typically rewards this. To provide some context, Adobe delivers diversified software solutions globally, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, serving enterprise clients within the Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. *LTM: Last Twelve Months But do these figures provide the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine whether Adobe still possesses an advantage that remains robust. Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet there is considerable merit in a more diversified approach. If you're aiming for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) – HQ has exceeded its benchmark, which is a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices, achieving returns greater than 105% since inception. Effective risk management is essential; consider what the long-term performance of your portfolio might be if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ’s performance metrics. Here is our criterion for selection: We evaluate stocks valued at over $10 Billion in market cap, filtering out those with high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also only consider stocks that have significantly decreased in valuation over the past year. Below are statistics for stocks with this selection methodology applied since 12/31/2016. That being said, Adobe has experienced some significant declines in challenging periods. It fell approximately 72.5% during the Dot-Com bubble and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the drop was around 60%. Even during less severe downturns, such as in 2018 and the Covid pandemic, it still saw roughly a 25% decrease in value. Therefore, despite everything working in its favor, Adobe is not immune when market conditions worsen. However, the risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decline even when the markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to review how the stock has bounced back from notable dips in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks generate superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s a smoother ride, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Backed by unwavering support from asset managers like JPMorgan and exchanges, the momentum is rising constantly. With a marketing cap over $55B, meme coins have Lamborghini potential (think 7-10x in a day). High-risk, high-reward players naturally love them, and so should you.

This page gives you the inside edge—live updates on trending meme coins, alpha from crypto degens, and whispers from FOMO-driven trading circles. If you’re hunting for the next 10x or 100x gem, you’re in the right place. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest insider insights on the best meme coins, so keep refreshing! October 21, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Bitcoin’s resilience, following the October 10 market crash, which wiped out $19B in leveraged positions and more than $450B in market cap, hints at a coming bull run. According to analysts at TD Cowen, Bitcoin could reach $141K by December if the asset regains its lost momentum. Following the brutal market crash, Bitcoin lost 10% in a matter of hours and dipped below $105K over the course of a week. A $141K prediction is more than feasible given Bitcoin’s resilience to such a devastating hit, and thanks to Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) presale, currently at $24.4M. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 Solution, Hyper aims to enhance the Bitcoin network by making it faster, cheaper, more performant, and more scalable, thereby accommodating institutional investors who require high throughput and near-instant finality. Learn how to buy $HYPER right here. October 21, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Global investment management firm VanEck recently filed an application with the SEC for an ETF that tracks the price of Lido Staked $ETH ($stETH). If approved, it would be the first of its kind in the US. The firm also stated in a blog post that its ETF would give institutional investors ‘a compliant, tax-efficient way to gain Ethereum staking exposure within a regulated investment structure.’ While ETFs, such as those proposed by VanEck, offer investors a way to profit from crypto without owning the asset directly, others prefer to hold their investment directly. These investors, however, understand the challenge of finding promising assets to buy, especially if they’re in the market for the best meme coins. This is where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in with its proposed Snorter Bot. When launched, it’ll be a Telegram-based crypto trading bot that facilitates features such as sniping, copying trades, and managing wallets. Find out more about Snorter Token here. October 21, 2025 • 13:00 UTC Tom Lee’s BitMine Immersion continued with its Ethereum ($ETH) buying spree as the second-largest crypto’s price slid over the past few days. The world’s top Ethereum corporate treasury bought an additional 203,826 $ETH yesterday, which brought its total holdings to 3,236,014 $ETH. Lee said in a statement yesterday that with the expected Ethereum Supercycle, the currently low price of the coin represents an attractive risk/reward.’ Like Lee, other crypto traders are looking for alternative digital assets that are promising yet reasonably priced, such as Maxi Doge ($MAXI). The project aims to position $MAXI as one of the market’s best meme coins and dethrone its distant cousin Doge. To date, the $MAXI presale has raised over $3.7M, as it continues to attract fellow degens to the fold. Get the full details in ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ October 21, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate to hold Bitcoin, recently purchased 168 $BTC at an average price of $112,051, according to a filing on Monday. The recent purchase brings up strategy’s total $BTC holdings to 640,418 (worth $71B), with an overall average purchase price of $74,010. $BTC prices have been on a rollercoaster since the market crash on October 10th. The OG crypto rebounded to $111K on Monday after falling to as low as $103,500, helping MSTR shares climb by 3% in pre-market trading, just below $300 per share. While institutional giants like Strategy continue to expand their $BTC reserves, retail investors remain cautious amid market volatility, redirecting capital toward promising presale opportunities with strong upside potential. One such rising contender is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — a Layer-2 scalability solution that employs Solana Virtual Machine to bring lightning-fast transactions and cross-chain operability to Bitcoin’s Layer 1. Check out our expert $HYPER price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:47 UTC Binance founder Changpeng Zhao believes that the crypto captain has what it takes to flip gold’s market cap, although it might take some time. Currently, gold is the world’s largest asset, but that is likely to change soon, as the $BTC price soars over the coming cycles. Currently ranked eighth, $BTC has a market cap of $2.2T. CZ’s post also serves as a reminder that the long-term crypto projection looks strong, despite brief corrections. This is further evident from Bitcoin Hyper’s sizzling hot presale, ready to smash through $25M. The project is building a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, bringing more speed and programmability to the network. Could $HYPER be the next meme coin to explode? Read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to find out. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Elon Musk reignites meme coin manis with his new viral post ‘Flōki is back on the job as 𝕏 CEO!’ His post sent $FLOKI soaring over 20% within hours, causing the token to climb from $0.00006689 to $0.00007456. $FLOKI’s derivatives volume spiked by 663% and open interest rose by 165%, all indicating strong retail speculation surrounding the asset. $FLOKI did not soar alone; Musk’s post helped the entire meme coin market cap to rise by 5.8% to $55.2B, once again highlighting his unmatched influence on dog-themed tokens. FLOKI’s official X account declared it the ‘#1 trending token on CxoinGecko,’ branding itself as ‘Elon’s dog.’ With $FLOKI riding Musk’s viral wave, the newest contender in the block is quietly stealing the spotlight – Maxi Doge ($MAXI). A meme token built on a body-building trading doge that represents gym pumps, raw strength, and the grind of the bull market. Beyond the high-octane meme appeal, the project is already building a loyal community united by its bold ‘crush the charts’ motto. Check out our in-depth $MAXI price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock just launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) on the London Stock Exchange with the starting price of $11.10. As the official press release states, the goal is to expose ‘retail investors (i) with specific knowledge and/or experience of investing in similar products’ to Bitcoin and other digital assets in a regulated ecosystem. BlackRock’s IB1T is now available in 12 registered locations, including Austria, Spain, Portugal, UK, and Germany. The news is bullish for Bitcoin and could catalyze its Q4 run once $BTC breaks the $120K resistance point again. When that happens, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) may also see visible boost, although the presale is already in full bull mode. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2, promising a faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Hyper already raised $24.4M in presale and it targets a Q1 2026 release date if the market is favorable.

Intel (INTC) is set to report third-quarter earnings after markets close Thursday, and traders expect the stock to be unusually volatile following the results. Intel shares are expected to move nearly 10% in either direction the day after this week’s earnings report, according to recent options prices. A jump of that magnitude, based on Monday's closing price, would put shares at about $42, their highest price since April 2024. Alternately, shares could decline 10% to end the week at just above $32. Intel shares have moved an average of 6.5% after its four most recent earnings reports. In July, the stock dropped more than 8% after it reported an unexpected loss and issued a disappointing third-quarter forecast. The last time Intel shares rose on an earnings report was this time last year, when the company touted “solid progress” on its turnaround plan. Intel's stock has surged in recent months, boosted by optimism about the federal government's stake in the chipmaker and what it means for its troubled foundry business. Expectations for a large post-earnings move likely reflect the stock's recent run-up and uncertainty about how recent investments will affect operations in the near term. Thursday’s report will be Intel’s first since the federal government took an approximately 10% stake in the company. That deal with the Trump administration may have been a turning point for the embattled chipmaker, which has since received additional investments from Japanese venture capital firm SoftBank and AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), with whom Intel will partner on custom hardware. During the post-earnings conference call on Thursday, investors will be hoping for updates from executives on those investments and whether they change the outlook for Intel's struggling foundry business The deals have at least been a lifeline for Intel’s stock, which was treading water until rumors of White House negotiations began to circulate in early August. Intel shares have risen 90% since the start of the year, and all of those gains have come in the last three months. Still, analysts are on the whole skeptical that the stock can maintain its recent momentum. Five of the seven analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha have assigned Intel stock a “Hold” rating, while two suggest selling. The average price target of about $30.60 represents nearly 20% downside from Monday's closing level.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs record fourth consecutive day of outflows

Bitcoin ETFs post $40.5 million outflow, fourth straight day of losses. Bitcoin falls nearly 3% to $108,112 as crypto sentiment weakens. BlackRock launches Bitcoin ETP in London amid market turbulence. US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $40.4 million in net outflows on Monday, marking their fourth straight day of negative flows, according to data from Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the only spot Bitcoin ETF to register outflows during the session, with $100.7 million exiting the fund. The losses were partly offset by inflows into five other ETFs managed by Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, and Invesco. The latest outflow follows Friday’s $366.6 million and Thursday’s $536.4 million withdrawals, extending a streak of negative sentiment that has persisted across digital asset funds since last week. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs also recorded continued weakness, with $145.7 million in net outflows on Monday — their third consecutive day of redemptions. Bitcoin fell sharply on Tuesday, reversing its weekend rebound as cryptocurrencies lagged behind other risk assets that benefited from easing US-China trade tensions. The world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped nearly 3% to $108,112.30, struggling to maintain the $110,000 level after a volatile start to October that erased roughly $500 billion in total crypto market capitalisation. Traders cited the lingering impact of the early-October flash crash — which triggered widespread liquidations and heightened risk aversion — as a key reason for the muted recovery. Market participants appeared hesitant to re-enter positions amid ongoing volatility and renewed concerns over ETF outflows. Optimism surrounding “Uptober,” a term describing the crypto market’s historical tendency to perform strongly in October, has faded rapidly. Bitcoin is now down more than 2% for the month, underscoring the loss of bullish momentum. The broader crypto market mirrored Bitcoin’s slide, with most major altcoins trading lower. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, fell 5.3% to $3,859.65, slipping below the key $4,000 threshold. XRP declined 2.2% to $2.4145, showing little reaction to the announcement of a new treasury backed by issuer Ripple Labs. Binance’s BNB token dropped 5.7%, while Cardano and Solana shed between 4% and 6%. Among memecoins, Dogecoin fell 4.3%, and $TRUMP lost 3.1%, reflecting a broad-based retreat across the digital asset space. Amid the downturn, BlackRock announced the launch of a new Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP) in the United Kingdom, following the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to relax restrictions on crypto-based investment vehicles. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, listed on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, is structured as a Bitcoin-linked security that allows investors to purchase fractional units of Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. The product is designed to closely track BTC prices while operating within a regulated investment framework. According to The Sunday Times, the entry price for the product will allow investors to buy fractions of Bitcoin for about $11 per unit, providing retail investors with exposure to the digital asset without direct ownership or the need to trade on crypto exchanges. BlackRock remains one of the most successful issuers of Bitcoin-linked products, with its US-listed iShares Bitcoin ETF holding more than $85 billion in net assets, according to SoSoValue data.

Title: $2B to flow into BlackRock’s UK Bitcoin ETF: How UK traders could recycle into IBIT

IBIT wrapper launch in the UK opens a market that could funnel between $1.5 billion and $2 billion into the fund over time. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) began trading in the UK on Oct. 20, opening a market that could funnel between $1.5 billion and $2 billion into the fund over time as UK retail investors gain regulated access to Bitcoin (BTC) exposure. The launch capitalizes on the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) recent reversal of its ban on crypto-based exchange-traded products (ETPs). BlackRock’s US Bitcoin ETF, which launched two years ago and has nearly $65 billion in lifetime inflows, now offers British investors entry at approximately $11 per unit. This is a fraction of Bitcoin’s current $110,365 price. BlackRock reported $17 billion in net inflows to its digital asset products during the third quarter alone, part of $205 billion in total net inflows as the firm crossed $13 trillion in assets under management. The UK crypto market holds an estimated £13.3 billion across 7 million investors, per FCA data from March 2025. An IG report from early October projected the market could expand 20% following the FCA’s policy shift, translating to £2.4 billion to £3.2 billion in new capital, or roughly $3.2 billion to $4.3 billion. Bitcoin products have captured 60.6% of crypto investment flows globally, according to CoinShares’ latest report. Applied to UK projections, Bitcoin-focused vehicles could draw $1.93 billion to $2.6 billion. IBIT’s dominance in the US market, where it commands 75.5% of all Bitcoin ETF inflows since launch, suggests the fund could secure $1.5 billion to $2 billion from British investors. The fund’s structure removes traditional barriers that kept mainstream investors on the sidelines. Rather than navigating crypto exchanges, managing private keys, or purchasing entire coins, investors buy regulated shares through familiar brokerage accounts. The low entry threshold, roughly $11 per unit, democratizes access to an asset that trades above $100,000. BlackRock’s survey data supports aggressive growth projections. The firm expects a 21$ increase in UK adults investing in crypto for the first time over the next 12 months, with Britain ranking third in European crypto investment growth. The company predicts 4 million Bitcoin investors in the UK by year-end. Interest concentrates among younger demographics. IG’s research found 50% of 18-24-year-olds and 49% of 25-34-year-olds would consider investing in crypto via exchange-traded notes. Additionally, 32%of prospective investors cite regulatory oversight and safety as primary motivations, while 19% value the ability to hold crypto within tax-efficient Individual Savings Accounts and Self-Invested Personal Pensions. Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, with 95% already mined, creates scarcity dynamics that amplify demand pressures. BTC’s price grew 120% last year, and is up by nearly 20% in 2025, driven partly by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance following his return to the White House. The UK government outlined plans last month for a comprehensive crypto-asset regulatory regime overseen by the FCA, positioning Britain to compete with jurisdictions that moved faster on digital asset frameworks. BlackRock’s launch transforms that regulatory shift into accessible products for millions of retail investors who previously faced exclusion or complexity barriers.

Title: Ethereum Whale BitMine Buys 203,800 ETH – Now Holds 2.7% Of Circulating Supply

Ethereum (ETH) treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies today announced that it had bought another 203,800 ETH last week. Following its latest purchase, the firm’s total ETH holdings now stand 3.24 million tokens. According to a press release issued earlier today, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a leading Ethereum treasury firm has further increased its ETH holdings. The firm added another 203,800 ETH over the last week, worth approximately $820 million. Last week’s purchase has increased BitMine’s total ETH holdings to 3.24 million ETH, representing roughly 2.7% of the active circulating supply. In addition, the company holds 192 Bitcoin (BTC) and $219 in cash. The firm has $1.34 billion in combined crypto and cash holdings. BitMine’s frequent ETH purchases have propelled it as the leading public company in terms of ETH held on its balance sheet. Earlier this month, the firm had reported that its total ETH holdings had surpassed 3 million tokens. Commenting, Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine said: The crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events ever last week and this put downward pressure on ETH prices. Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30th of this year. Given the expected Supercycle for ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward. We acquired 203,826 ETH tokens over the past week pushing our ETH holdings to 3.24 million, or 2.7% of the supply of ETH. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH. Lee added that he sees Ethereum as a “truly neutral” blockchain which is likely to witness growing institutional adoption. He added that BitMine remains committed to accumulating 5% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Following today’s announcement, the NYSE-listed firm’s stock BMNR surged an impressive 7.76%, trading at $53.72 at the time of writing. The stock is up an astonishing 640.87% over the past six months. As institutional adoption of Ethereum grows, analysts are predicting new all-time highs (ATH) for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to crypto analyst HAMED_AZ, ETH can surge to $6,400 on the back of a new bullish wave. Recent trends show that some institutional investors are even replacing BTC with ETH, due to the latter’s greater flexibility and wider variety of uses. Major asset manager, BlackRock recently shifted some of its BTC holdings to ETH. That said, some analysts are cautious of the trend of Ethereum treasury firms adding ETH on their balance sheets. At press time, ETH trades at $4,019, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: The Jio tariff hike everyone expected isn’t coming—yet
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/reliance-jio-tariff-hike-broadband-ai-expansion-11760857183061.html

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s largest telecom operator by market share, has no immediate plans to increase mobile phone tariffs, belying market expectations, choosing instead to grow revenue by driving users to consume more data. Jio and its closest rival Bharti Airtel Ltd recently removed their entry-level plans to bump up their average revenue per user (or Arpu, a key performance metric for telecom operators), triggering expectations that the telecom operators would increase tariffs towards the end of the year or in early 2026. “We are nudging consumers to consume more and happily pay more, but no immediate plans for the tariff (hike)," said Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy at Reliance Jio Infocomm, during an earnings call with analysts. In the September quarter, Jio’s monthly average revenue per user rose 1.2% to ₹211.4 from ₹208.8 at the end of June, with growth slowing due to promotional 5G offers, according to the company. Following Jio’s decision to remove its entry-level pack, analysts had expected it to both raise tariffs and focus on premium services to close the gap with Bharti Airtel, which leads the industry in terms of Arpu ( ₹250 at the end of June). Airtel is yet to declare its September-quarter earnings. “If Reliance were not to increase tariffs in the next few months, its [year-on-year] Arpu growth for the March quarter would likely be 4% (at say ₹214/subscriber)," J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note dated 19 October. “Investors continue to expect Jio to raise telecom tariffs ahead of the proposed IPO of Reliance Jio (likely by June 2026)." Jio net added 8.3 million mobile subscribers during the September quarter, taking its subscriber base to 506.4 million. At the end of September, Jio had 234 million 5G subscribers, up from 213 million in the preceding June quarter. 5G now accounts for 50% of Jio’s total wireless traffic. Leading tariff hikesWhen telecom operators raised tariffs in July 2024 after a gap of over two years, it was Reliance Jio that took the lead with a 12–25% price hike. But while Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd have been vocal about the need to hike tariffs to increase the return on capital employed (RoCE, a measure of profitability and efficiency), Jio has refrained from openly talking about increasing tariffs. “We (the industry) are operating with the lowest Arpus and the lowest rate per gigabyte. Yet you have to make money," Bharti Airtel’s managing director and vice chairman Gopal Vittal said at an industry event earlier this month, adding that there was room for raising telecom tariffs. In fact, Vittal had earlier called for a change in the telecom tariff structure, by reducing data allowances on some telecom packs and charging for more data. “Though RIL (Reliance Industries) is non-committal on possible tariff hike, management indicated they have other levers like unlimited 5G slab increase, etc., to drive Arpu growth along with the accelerated roll out of FTTH (fiber-to-the-home)/FWA (fixed wireless access)," Antique Stock Broking analysts said in a note dated 19 October. Also Read | Jio Platforms IPO could see another tariff war—to hike telecom rates Jio’s broadband focusJio, during its earnings call last week, said it was looking to add more home broadband subscribers faster. It added more than 1 million new homes each month during the July-September quarter, taking its total fixed broadband connections to 23 million. Jio has set a target of 100 million home broadband customers, with no specified timeline. “The rate for connecting new homes has been increasing and the technology is working well," Thakur told analysts during the call. “A lot of these new connections are being done wirelessly, and therefore the implementation itself is simpler, faster, and we are expecting that we will be able to scale this up quite significantly from where we are today." Jio is leveraging its unlicensed band radio technology—the 5G Air Fibre and fiber route—to provide home broadband internet.

On the role of Jio’s parent, Jio Platforms Ltd, in this arrangement, Thakur said, “Jio is going to develop its own products and it is going to work with Reliance Intelligence to bring its solutions to the market." Jio Platforms houses the telecom and digital services business of Reliance Industries. Reliance Jio Infocomm is a subsidiary of Jio Platforms, accounting for most of its business. Reliance Intelligence will develop and invest in creating AI products, Thakur explained, adding that this would require a lot of infrastructure and computing needs such as graphic processing units (GPUs).

While Jio will have an open slate to work with companies such as OpenAI, Meta and Google, Reliance Intelligence will compete with these global tech giants, he said. “This dual structure—RI (Reliance Intelligence) developing core AI capabilities and Jio leveraging them across its platforms—ensures lower incremental investment needs, stronger integration, and long-term cost efficiency, positioning Reliance to monetize enterprise AI workloads and India- specific digital services in the coming years," the Antique Stock Broking analysts said in their note. Jio Platforms reported a 12.8% year-on-year growth in net profit to ₹7,375 crore for the September quarter. Revenue from operations rose 14.6% to ₹36,332 crore. When telecom operators raised tariffs in July 2024 after a gap of over two years, it was Reliance Jio that took the lead with a 12–25% price hike. But while Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd have been vocal about the need to hike tariffs to increase the return on capital employed (RoCE, a measure of profitability and efficiency), Jio has refrained from openly talking about increasing tariffs. “We (the industry) are operating with the lowest Arpus and the lowest rate per gigabyte. Yet you have to make money," Bharti Airtel’s managing director and vice chairman Gopal Vittal said at an industry event earlier this month, adding that there was room for raising telecom tariffs. In fact, Vittal had earlier called for a change in the telecom tariff structure, by reducing data allowances on some telecom packs and charging for more data. “Though RIL (Reliance Industries) is non-committal on possible tariff hike, management indicated they have other levers like unlimited 5G slab increase, etc., to drive Arpu growth along with the accelerated roll out of FTTH (fiber-to-the-home)/FWA (fixed wireless access)," Antique Stock Broking analysts said in a note dated 19 October. Jio’s broadband focusJio, during its earnings call last week, said it was looking to add more home broadband subscribers faster. It added more than 1 million new homes each month during the July-September quarter, taking its total fixed broadband connections to 23 million. Jio has set a target of 100 million home broadband customers, with no specified timeline. “The rate for connecting new homes has been increasing and the technology is working well," Thakur told analysts during the call. “A lot of these new connections are being done wirelessly, and therefore the implementation itself is simpler, faster, and we are expecting that we will be able to scale this up quite significantly from where we are today." Jio is leveraging its unlicensed band radio technology—the 5G Air Fibre and fiber route—to provide home broadband internet.

Title: Anthropic Expands Claude Code to Web and iOS for Cloud Coding
URL: https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2025/10/20/anthropic-expands-claude-code-to-web-and-ios-for-cloud-coding/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T21:55:04Z
Full Content:
AI startup Anthropic is bringing its AI coding assistant Claude Code to the web and iOS, giving developers a way to run coding jobs straight from their browser or phone. The new tool, now in beta, lets users offload tasks like bug fixes, backend tweaks, or documentation updates—all handled in the cloud. Developers can connect GitHub repositories, describe what they need, and watch as Claude codes in real time inside a secure, isolated sandbox. Each task runs independently with live progress updates, and multiple jobs can run in parallel across different projects. When done, Claude automatically generates pull requests and change summaries. The iOS version offers a mobile-friendly way to steer code sessions on the go, though Anthropic says it’s an early preview meant for testing and feedback. Security-wise, all sessions are locked down in sandboxed environments with strict network limits. Git actions go through a secure proxy to ensure Claude only touches approved repositories. Developers can even whitelist domains—for example, to allow package downloads for testing. With this release, Anthropic is clearly signaling it wants Claude Code to become more than a chat-based helper—it’s positioning it as a full-fledged AI pair programmer in the cloud, available anywhere you work. Check out the promo video below: Anthropic has raised billions in funding, with its most recent $13 billion US Series F round in September 2025—valuing it at whopping $183 billion US—led by Iconiq, Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Key earlier backers include $4 billion from Amazon in 2023 and $2 billion from Google, alongside investors like Bessemer Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, General Catalyst, Cisco Investments, and over 80 others such as BlackRock.

Title: BlackRock launches Bitcoin ETP in London
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/blackrock-launches-bitcoin-etp-in-london/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T21:30:21Z

BlackRock’s latest move brings regulated Bitcoin exposure to UK investors for the first time. The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) opened strong on the LSE. BlackRock’s IB1T launched on the London Stock Exchange, giving UK retail investors direct access to Bitcoin. The launch follows the FCA’s policy shift, allowing retail access to crypto-linked products. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETP [IB1T] is now live on the London Stock Exchange [LSE]. This marks a key milestone for retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin in the UK. The move signals both a policy shift from British regulators and BlackRock’s growing dominance in the digital-asset investment space. According to data from BlackRock’s official listing page, IB1T opened trading on 20 October 2025 at $11.10, climbing 5.54% on its first day. The exchange-traded product (ETP) is physically backed by Bitcoin. It offers investors direct exposure to the asset’s spot price without needing to hold or custody BTC themselves. BlackRock said the product carries a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.15% per annum until 31 December 2025, after which it will rise to 0.25%. The firm confirmed the ETP complies with UK regulatory requirements and maintains its reserves through regulated custodians. The launch follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to relax rules that had previously blocked retail participation in crypto-linked products. By approving products like IB1T, the UK is signaling a more pragmatic approach toward digital-asset investment. This aligns it with the U.S. and European markets that already allow similar instruments. The move also comes as Bitcoin trades around $110,000, recovering from recent volatility that briefly sent prices below $104,000. The renewed institutional inflows from newly launched products could help stabilize BTC’s trajectory and re-anchor market confidence. BlackRock’s debut places it among a growing list of European Bitcoin ETP issuers, including WisdomTree, 21Shares, and CoinShares, all of which operate similar products across Germany, Switzerland, and France. Traditional financial heavyweights are now competing head-to-head in Europe’s maturing digital-asset market, where regulation is fast becoming a competitive advantage. The new listing adds to BlackRock’s expanding digital-asset portfolio. Its portfolio includes a U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF, an Ethereum ETP, and the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). With the UK now opening the door to mainstream crypto investing, BlackRock’s move shows the growing convergence between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets. The iShares Bitcoin ETP could become a benchmark product for retail Bitcoin exposure in one of the world’s oldest and most influential financial centers.

Title: This Wall Street Firm Says Alphabet Stock Is A Better Bet Than Meta. Here's Why.

You don't necessarily have to choose between the stocks of two Big Tech giants—but if you must, Oppenheimer has a pick for you. Shares of both Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META), owner of Facebook and Instagram, have been strong performers this year, outpacing the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) and the S&P 500. Still, Oppenheimer's analysts prefer the former's shares to the latter's. On Sunday, they put a $300 price tag on Alphabet, about 18% above Friday's close and the highest on Wall Street, and an $825 target on Meta, 15% higher than last week's finish and below Visible Alpha's analyst average. The Oppenheimer analysts cited what they considered "more conservative" Street estimates on Alphabet, along with a lower valuation on the shares. While the Magnificent Seven group of big tech stocks has outpaced the S&P 500 this year, under the hood there are signs that it might make sense to pick and choose carefully among them. One example: Three of the stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 this year. "While we are positive on the long-term benefits from Meta's push into AI and proven ability to outgrow peers," they wrote, "we are more bullish on [Alphabet] near term, given more conservative estimates and lower valuation." While the Magnificent 7 is running ahead of the S&P 500 this year, it's not surprising that investors might be looking to pick and choose among the group these days: Three of the seven stocks have underperformed the benchmark index year-to-date. More stocks outside the group are lifting the index than in recent years, Capital Group wrote last week, a reference to what's known as market breadth, marking "a healthy move away from the extreme concentration that raised concerns about risks to investor portfolios." "Rising valuations among companies in the index and more clarity on tariffs and interest rate cuts could help lift the U.S. equities market, which has trailed those in Europe and elsewhere," Capital Group wrote.

Title: Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs Available to UK Users via Blackrock, 21Shares, and Others

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Bitwise have listed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETPs on the London Stock Exchange as FCA lifts the ban. Top global asset managers like BlackRock, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Bitwise have opened access to Bitcoin BTC $106 970 24h volatility: 3.5% Market cap: $2.13 T Vol. 24h: $90.46 B and Ethereum ETH $3 741 24h volatility: 5.3% Market cap: $451.52 B Vol. 24h: $42.75 B exchange-traded products that are available to UK retail investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF will be listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), with its shares physically backed by BTC and held via Coinbase. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has already been a massive success in the US, becoming the fastest ETF in history to approach $100 billion AUM, within 18 months of launch. Speaking on the development, Jane Sloan, EMEA head of global product solutions at BlackRock, said: “Built on institutional-grade infrastructure, [the product] enables UK investors to gain exposure to bitcoin with the confidence of robust custody and regulatory oversight.” The development comes 12 days after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifted its four-year ban on retail access to crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). As a result, this has opened the market to a wider investor base. Apart from BlackRock, other asset managers have also joined the listing race. On Monday, October 20, 21Shares listed two physically backed products for Bitcoin and Ethereum on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). It also includes a staking component for its Ethereum ETPs and a reduced 0.1% management fee for select offerings. The announcement comes as the asset manager also pushes for spot Dogecoin ETF approval in the US. 21Shares first launched its crypto ETPs for institutional investors in the UK last year, capturing 70% of total turnover on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), according to the company. Meanwhile, WisdomTree has listed its physically backed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE with fees of 0.15% and 0.35%. This also follows its earlier institutional offering in the UK. Asset manager Bitwise also announced plans to list its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE on Tuesday, with a reduced 0.05% fee on its Core Bitcoin ETP for at least six months. Back in 2021, UK’s top financial regulator FCA, had banned the sale, marketing, and distribution of crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors. With the latest policy shift, retail investors can now access these products through UK-regulated brokers and investment platforms, such as standard brokerage accounts and tax-efficient wrappers like ISAs and SIPPs, WisdomTree said on Monday. The update brings the UK’s regulatory framework closer in line with markets such as the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, and the EU. However, the prohibition on retail access to broader crypto derivatives remains in effect. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: $1.2B exits US Bitcoin ETFs just as London makes crypto comeback

$600B in futures inflow could be on the horizon as analysts say Europe’s new ETNs could ignite the next wave of mainstream inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The 12 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETFs) in the United States reversed sharply last week, recording $1.2 billion in net outflows. According to SoSoValue data, this was their second-largest weekly setback since launching in January 2024. The pullback snapped a two-week run of inflows that had brought in more than $5 billion, a period many read as proof of deepening institutional conviction. Data from SoSoValue show that investors pulled capital from nearly every major issuer. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a $276 million outflow, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw $169 million leave. Other major issuers, such as ARK Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB, lost $290 million and $128 million, respectively, while Grayscale’s two funds shed $321 million. The reversal followed a volatile week for Bitcoin, which briefly dipped below $104,000 during the reporting period. Notably, this was its lowest price level since June. Industry experts linked the drawdown to macroeconomic conditions triggered by US-China tariff wars, that shook confidence in risk assets like Bitcoin. However, the flagship digital crypto asset has rebounded strongly above $110,000 as of press time amid recent developments in the market. While US flows turned defensive, a different story that would reshape retail access for Bitcoin was unfolding across the Atlantic. On Oct. 20, Bitcoin exchange-traded notes (ETNs) officially began trading on the London Stock Exchange. This marks the end of the UK’s three-year retail ban on crypto investment products. BlackRock led the debut with its iShares Bitcoin ETP, joined by other leading issuers like Bitwise. Meanwhile, early feedback about these products has been mixed, but they have still shown promising signs. ByteTree founder Charlie Morris said initial trading activity showed “success with platforms such as Interactive Investor, Swissquote, and Trading 212,” though some brokers like AJ Bell were slower to support access. Still, Bradley Duke, Bitwise’s head of Europe, opined that the launch of these products would mark a “big week” for retail investors because the “direction of travel is clear for crypto.” With a new wave of adoption emerging across the Atlantic and renewed institutional focus on Bitcoin, Galaxy Research believes that crypto investment products could attract up to $600 billion in new inflows as traditional financial institutions broaden distribution. According to the firm, the US advisory market represents a vast, largely untapped opportunity that would drive significant flows into BTC. It stated: “Roughly 300,000 financial advisors manage about $30 trillion in client assets. If even a modest 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs emerged across this channel, that would translate to roughly $600 billion in potential inflows.” These wave of flows would would rival the entire global gold ETF market, now worth about $472 billion, and quadruple the combined $146 billion in assets under management (AUM) across US spot Bitcoin funds. The asset management firm pointed out that recent policy moves by leading traditional financial institiutions like Morgan Stanley and Vanguard support that thesis. Notably, Morgan Stanley recently recommended up to a 4% allocation to digital assets, while Vanguard is reportedly looking to offer select third-party crypto ETFs to its brokerage clients. These developments are expected to drive fresh capital into the emerging industry and further drive Bitcoin’s adoption. Galaxy Research argued that the full opening of large advisory platforms could mark a structural shift in how digital assets are integrated into mainstream finance. Once this access is fully enabled, financial advisors will be able to include crypto directly within traditional balanced portfolios, moving the asset class from retail-driven speculation toward advisor-led portfolio construction. It noted: “The impact could be substantial. New inflows may follow as wealth managers begin allocating to the asset class, potentially pushing total bitcoin ETF AUM to $500 billion within a few years, assuming just a 1% average allocation across managed portfolios. Such flows would reshape market dynamics and reinforce bitcoin’s position as a mainstream, investable asset.” Galaxy’s analysis further suggested that this transition could also bring a more mature form of liquidity. According to the firm, advisory-driven allocations tend to follow longer holding periods and stricter compliance frameworks, reducing the short-term turnover that has defined retail crypto trading. Over time, that discipline could enhance price stability, deepen liquidity, and align Bitcoin more closely with traditional asset classes such as equities, bonds, and gold.

Title: Ethereum In, Bitcoin Out: BlackRock Rebalancing Its Digital Asset Portfolio In Major Crypto Shift

Following the recent market crash due to Donald Trump’s tariff order, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a sharp decline below key support levels. While both coins fell strongly, ETH has emerged as the leading choice among major corporations, as these institutions swap their BTC for the altcoin leader. Major crypto assets such as Ethereum and Bitcoin are beginning to recover lost ground once again. Meanwhile, Ethereum appears to be leading the charge in terms of institutional adoption, reflecting the long-term potential of the leading altcoin. In a move that has triggered a frenzy across the crypto and traditional finance sectors, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is reportedly shifting a portion of its Bitcoin holdings into ETH. Coin Bureau shared this institutional pivot on the social media platform X, which has captured the attention of the crypto community. This daring rotation indicates a significant shift in institutional opinion and a rising belief in Ethereum’s sustained price growth. BlackRock‘s shift to ETH highlights the asset’s developing importance as the cornerstone of decentralized finance and next-generation financial infrastructure, even though Bitcoin keeps dominating as a store of value. Data shared by Coin Bureau reveals that the leading asset manager firm transferred about 272.4 BTC, valued at approximately $28.3 million, to Coinbase Prime. A few hours later, BlackRock was observed pulling out over 12,098 ETH worth $45.4 million. Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. has also been accumulating ETH at a significant and rapid rate. A recent report from BMNR Bullz shows that the leading treasury company purchased thousands of ETH within the past week to strengthen its digital asset treasury. Despite the recent market crash, the firm continues to double down on the altcoin, scooping up a total of 379,271 ETH, valued at $1.5 billion. With the massive purchase of Ethereum, Bitmine is demonstrating its conviction in the network’s expanding role in blockchain innovation. During the dip on Friday, Bitmine bought over 72,898 ETH worth $281 million. Three days prior to this acquisition, the firm purchased more than 104,336 ETH, valued at $417 million. Finally, a +202,037 ETH was made after the weekend crash, bringing the total to 379,271 ETH within a week. Bitmine’s persistent acquisition of the altcoin reflects the firm’s Co-CEO Tom Lee’s bold declaration that Ethereum will be the backbone of the digital economy. According to BMNR Bullz, this is not a buy signal, but a seismic shift. Prominent figures in the financial landscape are currently endorsing Ethereum. Robert Kiyosaki, a billionaire and author of the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” book, has included ETH as one of the key assets to hedge against the rising inflation across the world. While inflation keeps increasing and making it difficult for the poor and middle class, the billionaire has urged this set of people not to rely on government fake money or fiat currency. Instead, they should invest in Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, which he labels the real money. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

On Oct. 15, two Wall Street titans offered radically different visions of the private credit market. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors that recent bankruptcies in private credit could be just the beginning: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Hours later, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink struck a defiant tone on his firm’s earnings call: “I’ve never been more excited about the future of BlackRock,” he said. BlackRock has bet $12 billion on private credit through its acquisition of HPS Investment Partners. So who is right? Investors have been so worried about the stability of private credit recently that their frantic selling drove up the VIX “fear” index by 35% over the past month. They are spooked by the collapse in September of Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender and dealer, revealing allegations of fraud in which the company allegedly pledged the same collateral to multiple banks. Private credit was dealt another blow late last month when First Brands, an auto parts supplier, collapsed into bankruptcy, owing $10 billion, triggering federal investigations into $2.3 billion in missing funds. Then on Oct. 16, regional banks Zions Bancorporation disclosed fraud-related losses and Western Alliance flagged nearly nearly $100 million in alleged fraud, catalyzing a market rout that erased $100 billion in market cap from U.S. bank stocks and pushed market volatility to four-month highs. Major institutions tallied their damage: JPMorgan took $170 million in Tricolor losses; UBS disclosed over $500 million in First Brands exposure; and Jefferies revealed $715 million in questionable receivables. The private credit market—which has grown from $200 billion to $3 trillion globally in 15 years—suddenly looked vulnerable. But credit analysts and executives who spoke to Fortune have mixed views on Wall Street’s panic. Several argue that the failures aren’t private credit problems at all. According to them, these instances are traditional bank lending blowups, and the mislabeling reveals more about competitive tensions between old-guard banks and private credit disrupters than genuine systemic risk. The question, however, is whether these analysts are right, or whether they’re dangerously downplaying cracks in a $3 trillion market that is systemically important to global finance. The definition problem “First Brands, if it was rated by us, would not have been considered in any way, shape, or form a private credit transaction,” said Bill Cox, chief rating officer at Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA), which tracks thousands of private credit loans. “Its main debt was full-on public, broadly syndicated loans.” This distinction matters. The broadly syndicated loan (BSL) market—dominated by large commercial banks—operates differently from the direct lending market that defines private credit. BSL loans are originated by banks, syndicated to multiple investors, and traded in public markets with daily pricing. Private credit loans, by contrast, are bilateral transactions between a lender and borrower, held to maturity in a “buy and hold” strategy with no secondary market trading. First Brands’ bankruptcy involved primarily BSL debt and receivables “factoring,” a form of lending where banks purchase a company’s accounts receivable at a discount in hopes of profiting later when clients pay their bills in full. Neither activity represents the core direct lending business that firms like Ares, Apollo, and Blackstone have built. “None of them do factoring,” Cox said of the dozens of private credit platforms his firm rates. “We looked at the entire universe of our CLOs, BDCs, and other facilities for exposure to First Brands. The exposure was de minimis,” he said, referring to collateralized loan obligations (bundles of loans sold to other investors) and business development companies (which are set up as investment bets on struggling or distressed companies). Brian Garfield, who heads U.S. portfolio valuation at investment banking firm Lincoln International, which performs over 6,500 quarterly valuations of private companies, echoed this view: “First Brands [largely had BSL facilities, and] that’s not the direct lending market. I think it’s important that we understand that alone in itself is really important, because there’s this whole combination of things that everyone is just putting … in one basket,” he told Fortune. The real state of private credit This isn’t to say private credit faces no challenges. Lincoln International’s proprietary data tracking the direct lending market shows covenant defaults—technical breaches of loan terms rather than payment failures—have risen from 2.2% in 2024 to 3.5% currently. Payment-in-kind (PIK) usage, where struggling borrowers defer cash interest payments, increased from 6.5% of deals in Q4 2021 to 11% today, with “bad PIKs” (repriced mid-deal) rising from 33% to over 50% of that total. “Are there cracks? Yes,” Garfield acknowledged. “But on average, are we seeing strong fundamental Ebitda growth? Yes.” His data shows last-12-months year-over-year Ebitda growth of 6% to 7%—the highest level since Q1 2021. KBRA’s analysis of 2,400 middle-market companies representing roughly $1 trillion in debt tells a similar story. Cox’s team projects defaults could peak at 5%, which he admitted is “a lot more than this industry has seen,” but he said was “relatively” low for public market comparables, the measure through which private company valuations can be derived by comparing the businesses to other similar companies that are already publicly traded on the stock market. Why the panic? Given the fundamentals aren’t catastrophic, analysts point to several factors beyond credit quality to explain investor anxiety, namely less stringent guardrails and documentation processes. “If something grows like a weed, maybe it is one,” Timur Braziler, who covers regional banks at Wells Fargo, told Fortune. “The availability of credit over the last five years, when you have more than one source competing for that same loan, maybe the underwriting isn’t as stringent.” Andrew Milgram, managing partner and chief investment officer of Marblegate Asset Management, an alternative investment firm focused on middle-market distressed and special situation investments, offered a more pointed critique: The competitive dynamics of unregulated lending inevitably lead to deteriorating standards. “When loans were done by banks, they were subject to oversight,” he explained. “As those loans moved out of the banking system into an unregulated environment, they began competing for business by loosening documentation, loosening underwriting standards.” Private credit loans are typically given out by nonbank lenders such as alternative asset managers, private equity firms, and pension funds. Without the guardrails and protections provided by traditional banks, who are beholden to regulators and the federal government, disaster can ensue, according to Milgram, who has long been skeptical of the private credit market. “Lending has been regulated in societies for all time. In fact, the Code of Hammurabi contemplated regulating lenders because every society, everywhere for all time has recognized that durable, responsible lending is central to the proper functioning of the economy,” he added. Cox sees a different dynamic at work: Competitive tensions between traditional banks and private credit upstarts have led to, in his opinion, a rise in misconstruing the overall risk of private credit and direct lending. “If your neighbor is saying it’s your dog that’s relieving itself on the lawn, and you know it’s not your dog, it’s pretty frustrating,” he says, noting that both Tricolor and First Brands were primarily bank lending failures, not private credit issues. He admits, however, that there are corners of the private credit market that are more exposed and involved in “riskier parts of credit,” where lenders provide loans at high risk in hopes of high returns. Private credit has a reputation for being directed at smaller, middle-market companies that are highly leveraged and potentially unable to secure traditional bank financing. While these firms may offer higher yields to offset the risk, they are more vulnerable to financial shocks. What comes next The debate over private credit’s risks won’t end with these bankruptcies. Braziler expects more fraud cases to emerge: “Just the abundance of credit, it makes sense that you’re going to have more of these bad characters.” However, he doesn’t see systemic risk to the banking sector. Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, expects continued stress but not catastrophe: “The weakest companies are starting to get hit as a result of the tariffs and economic slowdown. You’re going to see an increase in bankruptcies, but there isn’t systemic risk.” The real test may be transparency. Unlike BSL loans with daily market pricing, private credit valuations are less transparent, being updated quarterly using subjective methodologies. “It is really opaque,” Braziler notes. “It’s really hard to get a good understanding of who the end borrower is.” As BlackRock doubles down with its $12 billion HPS acquisition and Dimon warns of “cockroaches,” the private credit industry faces a credibility test. The question isn’t whether some loans will default—they will. It’s whether the industry’s risk management, documentation standards, and valuation practices can pass a financial stress test. “Anyone who has any amount of meaningful exposure to corporate credit markets, and in particular the leverage loan corporate credit markets, should be reexamining their portfolio in excruciating detail at this moment and really thinking hard about the quality of the underwriting that has gone into making those loans and the veracity of the reporting that supports their understanding of the performance of the business,” Milgram said. For now, the analysts who track private credit most closely see warning signs, not apocalypse. But in a market where definitional confusion obscures risk and competitive tensions drive narratives, distinguishing signal from noise is increasingly critical and difficult.

Title: BlackRock brings Bitcoin ETP to UK as regulator opens door for crypto products
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-brings-bitcoin-etp-to-uk-as-regulator-opens-door-for-crypto-products/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T13:52:32Z
Full Content:
The investment giant BlackRock has launched its first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP) in the United Kingdom, signalling a major step in bridging traditional finance with the crypto sector. The move follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to ease restrictions on crypto investment vehicles, allowing investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without directly holding it. The launch not only widens access to digital assets for UK investors but also highlights a growing convergence between global asset managers and regulators in adapting to the evolution of financial markets. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, now listed on the London Stock Exchange, is designed to mirror the price of bitcoin and offer exposure within a regulated structure. The product allows investors to buy fractions of bitcoin through units starting at about $11, making participation in the asset class more accessible. Unlike holding bitcoin directly, investors can trade the ETP through standard brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of digital wallets or private key management. The product’s underlying assets are securely held by regulated custodians, ensuring compliance and oversight under the UK’s financial rules. BlackRock’s UK-listed ETP builds on the firm’s earlier success with its bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, which has accumulated over $85 billion in net assets. It also adds to its European range, complementing listings in Switzerland, Paris, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt. The launch comes shortly after the FCA lifted its four-year ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on 9 October 2025. The regulator stated that UK investors could now access such products through approved exchanges, reflecting a broader acceptance of crypto-linked investment options. The decision marks a turning point for crypto regulation in the UK. It suggests a shift from outright restrictions to a more measured approach that balances investor protection with innovation. The FCA’s announcement followed months of consultation with industry players and international regulators. BlackRock’s move is expected to encourage other global asset managers to follow suit, as the UK repositions itself as a hub for financial innovation post-Brexit. The FCA’s approval has opened the door for firms such as VanEck, DWS, and WisdomTree to explore similar launches. For retail investors, the product offers exposure to bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional investment wrapper. It eliminates the need for managing crypto wallets and navigating unregulated exchanges, while allowing investment through familiar platforms. The regulator’s decision also aligns with the UK Treasury’s ambition to make the country a global centre for digital assets. It supports ongoing efforts to integrate blockchain into traditional finance, paving the way for tokenised funds and blockchain-based asset management in the future. Despite the easing of rules, the FCA maintained that its ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors will remain. While the ETP operates under a regulated structure, exposure to Bitcoin still carries the same volatility and market risks associated with the underlying asset. In parallel, the UK is exploring broader blockchain adoption across financial services. On 14 October 2025, the FCA announced new provisions allowing asset managers to use distributed ledger technology for fund tokenisation. The move is intended to foster innovation and efficiency, signalling that the regulator sees long-term potential in blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrencies. By facilitating regulated access to bitcoin and promoting tokenisation, the UK is gradually laying the groundwork for a digital financial ecosystem where traditional and decentralised finance coexist. BlackRock’s ETP marks a key milestone in this transition, setting the stage for more institutional crypto products in one of the world’s leading financial markets.

Title: Hedge-Fund Favorites Rose 23% In The Past Year

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. A bright young intern just left my firm to work for a New York hedge fund. That was bad news for me, but not unusual in the financial world. Hedge funds are magnets for talent, partly because in good years they can pay handsome bonus checks. Gurufocus.com maintains a screen of stocks popular with hedge funds. A year ago, I selected five of these stocks to recommend. They have risen 23.6%, leaving the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index in the dust at 15.3%. Frankly 15.3% is a fine year. But 23.6% is better, so let’s play this game again. Here are five hedge fund favorites that appeal to me now. Every major semiconductor company that I know of, with the exception of Intel Corp. (INTC), uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) to make its chips. TSM has expertise, precision and economies of scale. It also has a net profit margin of 42%, astoundingly high. Yet because Taiwan lives under a sword of Damocles – the threat of Chinese invasion – the stock is not horribly expensive. It sells for 30 times recent earnings, and 26 times the earnings analysts expect in 2026. Al Gore, U.S. vice president under President Clinton, is one of many investment managers who own it. He is the co-founder of Generation Investment Management, based in London. Warren Buffett, the legendary CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), one described hedge funds as a compensation scheme disguised as an asset class. That hasn’t stopped hedge funds from investing in Berkshire. Buffett will step down as chief executive at the end of this year. But I think highly of the team that will succeed him, beginning with Greg Abel as the next CEO. Berkshire’s debt-to-equity ratio is a nice low 19%. If the U.S. economy happens to get into trouble, Berkshire could rescue other companies on favorable terms, as it did in the past with Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. I’m on record as having predicted that the U.S. will be in recession by May 2026. Could I be wrong? Sure. But I see auto loan defaults rising, along with credit-card delinquencies. I see hiring petering out. And I think that tariffs and deportations are counterproductive for the economy. One firm that usually holds up well during economic downturns is Walmart Inc. (WMT). It is famous for its low prices. During recessions it can hold onto most of its previous customers, and get new ones who are trading down. Regrettably, at $107 a share, the stock’s valuation ratios are high. I would nibble if it falls below $100 and buy with enthusiasm at $90. JP Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) chairman Jamie Dimon remarked this month that soured bank loans are like “cockroaches.” You rarely see just one. JPMorgan Chase has been pretty successful in avoiding bad loans, although it did suffer some notoriety from its relationship with sex offender Jeffey Epstein. One thing I look for in a bank stock is a return on assets of 1.00% or more. JPMorgan Chase has done that in six of the past seven years, and seems certain to do so again this year. If the Federal Reserve cuts short-term interest rates, but rates on longer-term loans such as mortgages stay close to where they are now, it would be a Goldilocks scenario for JPMorgan. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), which makes bulldozers and other construction equipment, is looking at good news and bad news. The good news is that the dollar is weak, which helps the company export. More than half its sales usually come from outside the U.S. The bad news is that the Trump administration is slapping a lot of tariffs on imports, inviting retaliation. My guess is that the dollar effects will outweigh the tariff effects. The good performance of the hedge-fund favorites I recommended a year ago was sparked by H&E Equipment Services Inc., which sold itself to Herc Holdings Inc. (HRI) in June at a 68% gain. Customers Bancorp. Inc. (CUBI) also did well, returning 29%. On the flip side, D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) stumbled to a 14% loss as homebuilding languished. In between those extremes, Loews Corp. (L) achieved a 22% return, and Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) notched 13%. Figures are total returns including dividends, from October 28, 2024 through October 16, 2025. Note that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. Disclosure: Personally, and for most of my clients, I own Taiwan Semiconductor, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP began trading on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, with securities physically backed by Bitcoin held through Coinbase, as per the Financial Times report. "As the UK crypto investor base is projected to approach 4 million over the next year, today's listing of exchange-traded products like iShares Bitcoin ETP unlock a securer gateway to digital assets through traditional investment platforms,” the firm's EMEA head of global product Jane Sloan said, speaking to the FT. "Built on institutional-grade infrastructure, [the product] enables UK investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin with the confidence of robust custody and regulatory oversight," Sloan added. The product features institutional-grade security protocols, with Coinbase transferring Bitcoin from trading wallets into segregated, offline cold storage by day's end. The UK launch follows the runaway success of BlackRock's U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, which became the firm's most profitable fund just 21 months after launch, now managing over $87.5 billion in assets. The fund was on track to hit $100 billion in assets under management and become the youngest ETF to cross that milestone, but last week's market crash derailed the timeline. “The launch signals the advancing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as an investable asset class by both major regulators and global asset managers,” Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum, told Decrypt. Dori expects the UK launch to pave the way for broader crypto product offerings, noting that "in the U.S., additional ETPs beyond BTC/ETH and the first diversified crypto baskets are progressing through preparatory stages.” “At the same time, various traditional managers are expanding their digital-asset footprint, including tokenized securities in BlackRock’s case,” he added. He said it's reasonable to expect the Financial Conduct Authority to "proceed deliberately" by monitoring market conduct and retail outcomes before "broadening issuer participation" and considering additional crypto assets "in close alignment with other major financial centres." The launch also follows CEO Larry Fink's pivot on crypto, from describing Bitcoin as an "index of money laundering” in 2017 to placing crypto alongside gold in investors’ portfolios. “The markets teach you, you always have to relook at your assumptions,” Fink told CBS last week. “There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it's an alternative." However, market conditions remain choppy with digital asset investment products seeing $513 million in outflows last week following a Binance liquidity cascade on October 10 that triggered nearly $20 billion in liquidations, including roughly $16.7 billion in long positions, according to a CoinShares report. BlackRock's UK expansion comes amid broader concerns about regulatory fragmentation in the crypto sector. Last week, the Financial Stability Board warned that crypto firms are exploiting loopholes in fragmented global regulations, threatening financial stability as countries adopt wildly different approaches to policing the digital asset market.

Title: How a Cyber Charter Struck Back When It Was Fired by a School District in New Mexico

Peter Greene, the best education blogger ever, writes regularly for Forbes magazine. Hopefully, some of the nation’s business executives are learning about the for-profit entrepreneurs who have entered into the education “industry,”where they are profiting without doing much for students. Greene recently wrote about the latest setback for the giant of the cybercharter industry. It’s now called Stride, but for many years it was K12 Inc. Top executives are paid millions of dollars. Profit, not learning, is its highest priority. Despite terrible academic results, low graduation rates, complaints about inflated enrollments, there are always school districts happy to host the cybercharter industry because the district gets a cut of the profits. Greene writes: Stride, a giant in the cyber charter school industry, was accused by a New Mexico school district of violating rules and regulations. Now a lawsuit alleges that Stride responded by mounting a coordinated attack on the district and its superintendent. In 2020, Gallup-McKinley County Schools contracted with Stride (formerly known as K12 Inc) to operate its New Mexico Destinations Career Academy. But the district alleges that the for-profit organization repeatedly cut corners, violated staffing rules, and inflated enrollment numbers. In May 2025, the school board voted to end the contract. “Our students deserve better,” said School Board President Christopher Mortensen in a press release.“This action is not sudden; it is the result of months of effort to address persistent issues with the contractor. We are taking this step to protect our students, uphold academic standards, and meet our obligations under state and federal law.” Within months, the district had filed a complaint against Stride, charging them with fraud, unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and seven other counts. That lawsuit outlines the issues between Stride and the district. According to the complaint, Stride had continuing issues with meeting requirements for student-teacher ratios, having been notified as early as September 2023 that it was out of compliance. Special education teachers were over their permitted caseloads, and IEP students were not receiving their due process. Further, Stride failed to employ certified teachers, complete background checks, or provide state-mandated occupational and professional trainings to their staff. The district also alleges that Stride “retained nonexistent students on its rolls” and took school district funds for educating these ghost students. Stride failed to provide timely required communication with the district. Stride’s graduation rate, says the district, was “horrific,” with a graduation rate of 27.67% in 2024. The district also claims that through it all, Stride has “ignored compliance requirements” and failed to produce a remediation plan. According to the suit filed by the district, a management representative of Stride came forward in May as a whistleblower, declaring that the increases in student-teacher ratios was “intentional… in order to increase profit margins.” The whistleblower reported that he made multiple attempts to inform upper management that Stride was out of compliance with state law, and asked for authority to hire the roughly 80 teachers needed. The Vice President of Finance, says the whistleblower, refused to authorize those hires. Instead, in a later meeting, the whistleblower was allegedly told that his “projected profit margin was too low.” He was directed to cut staff for the next year to meet projected profit margin.” According to the whistleblower, Stride’s plans to deal with their troubles were not focused on meeting their obligations to the district. Instead, the whistleblower says, at an April meeting Stride’s Senior Vice President of School Development “Peter Stewart said the company should attack first publicly and Stride Inc. should develop a strategy for that” and that Stride CEO “James Rhyu said [to the group] that the Superintendent [for the School District] was in over his skis on this issue.” Alleges the district’s suit, ”Stride’s management, including the individual Defendants, engaged in and agreed to a civil conspiracy to cover up its misconduct and illegal activities acting, by and through its employees, agents and attorneys, in planning and engaging in a systemic public attack on the School District and its Superintendent of Schools to distract from its illegal activities and its breach of the contract with the Board of Education.” And counter-attack they did. On April 22, the district sent Stride a letter charging it had “materially breached” its contract. On April 28, the company filed an ethics complaint against GMCS Superintendent Michael Hyatt, alleging that he had tried to leverage Stride’s contract with the district in order to secure a “lucrative position” with Stride. Hyatt had applied for a management position with Stride in 2024; the company declined to hire him. The list of complaints by the district against Stride is long, but the theme is simple enough. Defendant Stride purposely and willfully disregarded the contractual requirements and the statutory and regulatory requirements in order to defraud the School District to increase its profits… Defendant Stride, while obligated to provide a certain quality of education to students, disregarded its legal obligations with the sole intent to profit on the education of students that it was supposed to educate, and that profit was obtained illegally through the intentional 27 violations of State law, incomplete and false reporting of student data, withholding technical support and operating and manipulating student counts to include students who had been dropped, withdrawn or were excessively absent. Asked for comment on the suit, a Stride representative directed me to the company’s suit-related web site which argues that the company has been working on an improvement plan, that their student-to-staff ratios are better than those reported by the district, and that “explosive growth” of NMDCA makes it hard to stay caught up with staffing. A reply to the district’s Aprill 22 letter contests virtually every point that the district has made about Stride’s performance. Since being cut loose from GMCS, Stride has re-opened NMDCA as a cyber charter school partnered with Charna Valley Independent Schools and Santa Rosa Consolidated Schools; a fact sheet from Stride says 3,000 students are enrolled, including 2,300 returning families. Those families, they say, are largely satisfied with the school. They also point out that many students enter the school short of credits, and that the majority of students are closing that gap. The Stride representative also sent a fact sheet alleging that GMCS is facing other legal problems. But Stride is no stranger to legal issues. It was founded in 2000 as K12 Inc by Ron Packard, former banker and Mckinsey consultant, and quickly became the leading national company for cyber schooling. One of its first big investors was Michal Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” Besides Milliken, Stride investors have included brothers Lowell and Larry Ellison, and BlackRock, founded by Larry Fink, whose brother Steve sits on the Stride Board of Directors. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, “despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012.” In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about “the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.” In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their “epic series of tech errors.” K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.” The district is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Stride. Four Stride executives are named in the suit in addition to Stride Inc itself. The court will decide who’s blowing smoke here. In the meantime, school districts continue to learn about the price of teaming up with aggressively for-profit partners. Wow, what a story! Looks like K12 Inc [now “Stride”] may finally be brought down [& hopefully snuffed out], after 26 yrs of ripping off the public with devious/ scurrilous practices. Kudos to New Mexico & its Gallup-McKinley County schools for persevering legally against this scam operation. LikeLike I’m going to blow up that first sentence and mount it on my wall. Thanks, Diane!

Title: Trump is attracting investment to the US – but at a huge cost to workers and the environment

University of Sussex provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.5shr7e5jm Share article Print article Early in his second presidency, Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs was met with widespread scepticism. Critics warned of economic decline and a global backlash. Yet the current landscape for the United States paints a more complex picture. Less than a year into his second term in office, the White House claims that Trump is bringing manufacturing back to the US. It also proclaims that Trump has secured trillions of dollars of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2025 alone. Other voices, however, estimate that these commitments will amount to just a fraction of that. So what’s the true picture? Much of this FDI is going into the US’s burgeoning semiconductor sector. This inward investment is indeed a stark reversal from the post-1991 trend of outbound American capital, when US firms raced to set up factories in countries where it was cheaper to manufacture. And the surge is bolstered by commitments of US$300 billion (£225 billion) in capital investment commitments from tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta. These investments reflect both Trump’s aggressive diplomacy and his close relationship with Silicon Valley’s tech elite. Despite concerns about a tech bubble, these investments signal a deepening state-private partnership, and a reorientation of priorities with a view to coming out on top in the global AI race. Central to this strategy is the reshaping of global supply chains. At a conference of venture capitalists in March, US vice-president J.D. Vance criticised US firms for their reliance on cheap overseas labour. He warned of the risks of losing the US’s technological advantage, especially to China. The solution, Vance and Trump argue, is to bring investments and jobs back home. But does this logic – backed by massive domestic and foreign investment – translate into the kind of reshoring (when operations that were previously moved abroad transfer back to the country) that delivers good jobs? In our new book Capitalist Value Chains, Christin Bernhold and I argue that global supply chains have made labour exploitation and environmental degradation worse. Efforts by both former president Joe Biden and Trump to contain China’s rise reflect not a retreat from globalisation, but a strategic reconfiguration of supply chains. In the early days of globalisation, American administrations supported China’s rise as the workshop of the world and an exporter of low-cost consumer goods to the US. But over the last 15 years, the US has increased efforts to contain China’s technological rise, while continuing to rely on its cheap imports. Trump’s tariffs on China represent a step change. The US’s strategy now seems to have shifted from slowing China’s advance to attempts to inflict severe economic damage on the Chinese economy in order to reduce it to a subordinate, rather than rival, trading partner. So will these investments create quality employment? And what are the environmental consequences? The likely answers are probably not, and probably terrible. Reshoring doesn’t mean abandoning global supply chains. Recently, Trump threatened sweeping tariffs on China in response to its restrictions on rare earth exports. Western industries – especially automotive and defence – warned that this escalation could break supply chains. US chip-dependent sectors such as electronics, defence and telecoms still rely heavily on Chinese rare earths. Even if the US succeeds in reshaping supply chains, it doesn’t guarantee the creation of good jobs. Despite Trump’s pro-labour rhetoric, his administration’s actions tell a different story. In March 2025, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency laid off 216,000 federal workers. Collective bargaining rights were stripped from 400,000 employees across agencies like Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. The White House also revoked the US$15 per hour minimum wage requirement for publicly-funded businesses. Traditional sectors are suffering. Since April, machinery giant John Deere has cut more than 2,000 jobs, citing cost increases blamed on Trump’s tariffs. The big three carmakers – Ford, GM and Stellantis – claim that tariffs will cost them US$7 billion in lost earnings in 2025, with severe consequences for pay and jobs. Will the tech sector’s massive capital spends offset these losses? Most of the US$300 billion pledged by firms like Apple and Amazon is earmarked for AI infrastructure: high-powered data centres, custom chips, graphics processing units and cloud networks. These are capital-intensive projects that generate short-term construction jobs but offer little in the way of long-term employment. Simultaneously, tech companies are downsizing as they substitute AI for human labour. Microsoft announced layoffs of 6,000 and 9,000 employees from its 228,000-strong global labour force in May and July 2025, including 800 in Washington, Microsoft’s home state. And what about the quality of the remaining jobs? At Amazon, for example, the company’s software engineers have described how it is using AI to cut jobs and speed up work. According to reports, tasks that previously took weeks are now expected to be completed in days. One engineer told journalists that his team was halved in size, but is expected to produce the same amount of code, using AI tools. The environmental costs of AI are mounting. Researchers have found that data centres already consume 4.4% of the US’s electricity. By 2028, AI could require as much power as 22% of American households use annually. This surge in demand, combined with federal budget cuts to green energy initiatives, is diverting renewable energy away from broader decarbonisation efforts such as hydrogen tech projects, battery plants and upgrades to the electric grid. These figures are only set to rise if the surge continues. According to the International Energy Agency, fossil fuels – particularly coal and natural gas – are expected to supply more than 40% of the additional electricity needed by data centres until 2030. Trump’s push towards AI, coupled with his tariff regime and alliance with Silicon Valley’s elite, may reshape the economy and global supply chains – but not in favour of workers or the planet. The promise of revitalised manufacturing and job creation masks deeper risks: automation, weakened labour protections and escalating environmental harm.

Title: Stocks Poised For More Gains As Shutdown Continues

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks rose Friday and notched gains last week as the government shutdown continues. The shutdown is now the third-longest in U.S. history. The record is 35 days from Donald Trump’s first presidential term. There was also a 21-day shutdown under President Bill Clinton. Last week, the large-cap S&P 500 index rose 1.7%, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index, was up 1.6%. Health care subsidies are central to the standoff between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats want Affordable Care Act subsidies to continue, and Republicans have refused to negotiate. Meanwhile, federal workers are set to miss their first full paycheck this week, which was originally scheduled for electronic deposit on Oct. 24. Key government data releases, including the monthly jobs report, are also delayed due to the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish the September 2025 Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Oct. 24, but no other reports will be produced until the government reopens. The inflation report will be instrumental to the Federal Reserve’s next meeting on Oct. 28 and 29. The Fed last met on Sept. 16 and 17, when the committee reduced the federal funds rate by a quarter-point and acknowledged the dual risks of inflation and unemployment. If the September CPI shows higher-than-expected prices, the Fed’s job of stimulating jobs gets more complicated. Lower interest rates can support higher employment but can also fuel price increases. CME FedWatch currently shows a 96.7% probability that rates will decline again in October, down from 98.7% on Friday. Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are up ahead of the market open on Monday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 are up 0.3%, Nasdaq 100 futures are up 0.4%, and Dow Jones futures have gained 0.2%. Netflix (NFLX), Coca-Cola (KO) and General Motors (GM) will report third quarter earnings on Tuesday. Tesla (TSLA) and IBM (IBM) are on the calendar for Wednesday, and Intel (INTC) and Ford (F) report Thursday.

Serving as the Company’s strategic foothold in Singapore, HUHU Singapore is expected to enhance HUHUTECH’s ability to capture the growth opportunities emerging in the region’s semiconductor sector. Mr. Yujun Xiao, Chief Executive Officer of HUHUTECH, commented, “The establishment of HUHU Singapore marks another important milestone in our global expansion strategy.

Singapore has attracted strategic investments from industry leaders including United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), Applied Materials, Inc., Micron Technology, Inc., and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC)’s affiliate Vanguard International Semiconductor. Singapore’s thriving semiconductor ecosystem and its pivotal role in the regional supply chain make it a strategic market for HUHUTECH. By building a strong local presence, we will be able to deliver comprehensive, one-stop solutions tailored to the needs of our Singaporean clients. Looking ahead, we are confident that HUHU Singapore will enhance our ability to capture new opportunities, reinforce our global network, and create long-term value for our shareholders while contributing to the sustainable growth of the semiconductor industry in Asia and beyond.” About HUHUTECH International Group Inc.

Stock futures are rising this morning as investors await a slew of earnings reports, key inflation data and updates on trade negotiations in the coming days; Amazon Web Services experienced disruptions that created service issues for several major websites; Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 17 model outsold the prior model in the U.S. and China during its first ten days on the market; proxy firm Institutional Shareholder Services advised Tesla (TSLA) shareholders to reject a proposed pay package for CEO Elon Musk; and Cooper Companies (COO) stock is rising on news activist investor Jana had built a stake in the medical device maker. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are gaining ground at the start of of a busy week for corporate earnings, after major indexes rose last week despite a volatile stretch of trading fueled by banking sector worries and trade-related tensions. Investors are awaiting further developments on the trade front and awaiting the scheduled release on Wednesday of inflation data that will factor into the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focussed Nasdaq added 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Gold futures were up nearly 2% at $4,295 an ounce, rebounding from a downturn on Friday that followed a string of record highs. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading near $111,000, after dropping below $104,000 on Friday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on an array of consumer loans, held steady at 4.01%. Several major websites went down after cloud platform Amazon Web Services experienced major outages early Monday. The outage affected several Amazon (AMZN) services, including Alexa, while also reportedly creating disruptions for Disney+, Lyft, the New York Times, Reddit, Ring, Snapchat, Reddit, Ring, Robinhood, T-Mobile, United Airlines, Venmo, Verizon, gaming site Fortnite, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Epic Games Store, AI model Perplexity and the McDonalds app. Shares of Amazon were little-changed in premarket trading. The shares have lost 3% since the start of the year, making Amazon the only member of the Magnificent 7 group of major technology stocks to be in negative territory in 2025. Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 17 model outsold the iPhone 16 by 14% during the first ten days of sales in the U.S. and China, the two markets that make up the bulk of the company’s phone sales, according to Counterpoint Research. The report said that improvements to the iPhone 17 provided value that helped draw in more buyers. “A better chip, improved display, higher base storage, selfie camera upgrade – all for the same price as last year’s iPhone 16,” said senior analyst Mengmeng Zhang. The report found that the base model iPhone 17 performed well in China, while the premium iPhone 17 Max saw strong demand in the U.S., with discounts provided by phone carriers helping to spur sales. Apple shares were up 1.5% in recent premarket trading. Proxy voting service Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is advising Tesla (TSLA) shareholders to vote against a proposed $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk. The proxy firm wrote that it was concerned about the magnitude and structure of the pay package, which features several lofty benchmarks that include pushing the company’s value to more than $8.5 trillion, well above its current market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion. ISS also advised shareholders to reject a proposal for Tesla to invest in Musk’s xAI, the AI company that merged with Musk’s X social media platform earlier this month. Tesla shares, which have gained 33% over the past three months, were up about 1% ahead of the opening bell. The company is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday. Shares of Cooper Companies (COO) surged more than 5% in premarket trading after activist investor Jana Partners reportedly built a stake in the medical device maker. The Wall Street Journal said Jana is looking for strategic alternatives for the company, including a potential deal to combine the company’s contact lens unit with rival Bausch + Lomb (BLCO). Shares of Bausch + Lomb were down nearly 2% in premarket trading.

Strategy (MSTR), the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin, purchased 168 BTC at an average price of $112,051, according to a filing on Monday. The company financed the acquisition by raising $18.8 million through the issuance of various perpetual preferred shares and common stock. This latest purchase brings MSTR’s total bitcoin holdings to 640,418 BTC ($71 billion), with an overall average acquisition price of around $74,010. BTC climbed to over $115,000 on Oct. 13 but fell as low as $103,500 on Oct. 17. Bitcoin’s has seen a recent rebound to $111,000 on Monday, helping MSTR shares to a 3% gain in pre-market trading, just below $300 per share. However, the stock remains negative on a year-to-date basis, compared to bitcoin's 19% gain. The MSTR/BlackRock iShares Trust (IBIT) ratio currently stands at 4.74, its lowest level since October 2024. This highlights how the IBIT ETF has outperformed MSTR over the past 12 months, as the ratio previously hit an all-time high of 8.0 in November 2024.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$110,317.97 and the broader crypto market recovered over the weekend, offering a brief reprieve after sticky selling pressure kept cryptocurrency prices depressed in the aftermath of a $500 billion value-destruction event. The price of bitcoin rose 3% in the past 24 hours to $110,770. It remains down about 4% for the month. The recovery came as global risk sentiment improves, with equities rising and investors rotating back into more volatile assets. U.S. President Donald Trump’s softer stance on tariffs and signs that the Federal Reserve may ease monetary policy later this year have helped calm markets. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rose 4.3% in the past 24 hours with all members in the green. “While bitcoin has seen a notable short-term correction, the long-term trend remains a different story, as the cryptocurrency’s trajectory is still heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, U.S. dollar strength, spot bitcoin ETF flows, and geopolitical risks,” XS.com markets analyst Linh Tran told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. Still, short-term momentum may not signal a lasting trend. Analysts at Coinbase Institutional warned that thin liquidity, a strong U.S. dollar and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's rate path continue to weigh on market structure. A spike in U.S. Treasury yields at the end of last week and geopolitical tensions with Israel conducting retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza after attacks on its forces while a ceasefire was in effect and as Russia advances in Ukraine, have kept many institutional investors cautious. Nevertheless corporate accumulation has kept on going, with BitcoinTreasuries data showing that in the past 30 days these entities increased their holdings by 8.4% to 4.04 million BTC. Access to crypto exposure is also growing, with BlackRock and 21Shares adding debuting their crypto ETPs on the London Stock Exchange for retail investors. “Overall, in my view, bitcoin is currently in a reaccumulation phase following its short-term correction, with market sentiment stabilizing and institutional demand remaining resilient,” Tran added.

Title: BlackRock’s Tokenized ETFs Are Only The Beginning, CEO Says

Time Published: 2025-10-20T10:10:00Z

Tokenized securities are moving closer to a reality as issuers make plans to bring more assets and funds on-chain. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Tokenization was once just a whisper in the wind. Now, it’s a scream. Investment giant BlackRock, which boasts more than $13 trillion in assets under management, has made tokenized ETFs a top priority, CEO Larry Fink confirmed on an earnings call last week. Fink, who said that the crypto industry is set to grow “rapidly,” is calling for more regulatory clarity as his firm builds up the technology required to tokenize both its ETFs and traditional securities. The move is the latest by one of the industry’s largest issuers to merge the worlds of traditional and decentralized finance and bring tokenization — and with it, instantaneous transactions — to the mainstream. The hurdle for issuers remains a lack of guidance, experts said. “The challenge with all the various tokenization projects to get ETFs or stocks on the blockchain is that we don’t actually have a legal structure to allow this,” said Dave Nadig, director of research at ETF.com. “What there aren’t right now are clean legal and regulatory rails for this kind of activity … I’m not holding my breath.” While BlackRock’s move to tokenize ETFs would be a significant step toward decentralized finance, issuers are still some distance away from fully on-chain securities, said Aaron Kaplan, founder and co-CEO of Prometheum. Although having digital representations of ETFs can speed up the transaction process, it still wouldn’t allow for immediate movement of the underlying stocks, which remain off-chain. Another roadblock is the lack of infrastructure and cybersecurity safeguards, Kaplan added, particularly if on-chain assets are going to be held digitally by a custodian. “You have to have the cybersecurity, the blockchain technology, the operational security — everything else that’s required in order to protect the keys,” Kaplan said. “Because in the event that the actual custodian gets hacked, they could take those [on-chain] assets and make them disappear.” Still, Kaplan predicts tokenized on-chain assets, which now account for more than $30 billion, will soon be sold in public markets, particularly as agencies continue signaling their support. Issuers’ concerns about receiving a regulatory letter if they tried using blockchain have dissipated since the Trump administration came into office, he added. “When it comes to securities, you have to have the proper licenses and the technology to conduct such activities,” he said. “[This is] as opposed to the cryptocurrency space, which has been a little bit more Wild West-y.” Just Around the Corner. Really. As the ETF industry enters a transitional period, with markets moving from electronic to digital transactions, Kaplan anticipates that expanding on-chain trades beyond crypto products is coming — probably in the fourth quarter of 2025 or early 2026. “Initial use cases will be ETFs of bundles of underlying cryptocurrencies,” Kaplan said. “As more assets move on-chain, you’ll be able to create additional ETF products and other structured products and the like … It just makes paramount sense.” Some of the largest S&P 500-based funds lost billions this year as institutional investors sought out cheaper alternatives. The rare earths industry is booming as the materials are used less in electric vehicles and more in AI data centers. Asset managers have repurposed sustainable funds amid a pullback from them in the US. This change is more substantial than most. Even with the lights out at the SEC, it’s unlikely that ETF issuers seeking 3x and 5x funds will sail through the approval process. The new VanEck TruSector ETFs invest in stocks and other ETFs to maximize exposure to individual companies and reflect actual market caps. No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. The meme stock category isn’t about stonks and tendies anymore, and the new iteration focuses on broader retail sentiment. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Amazon Web Services (AWS) went down on October 20, 2025, hitting its US-EAST-1 region hard. Millions of users lost access to platforms like Snapchat, Robinhood, Fortnite, Roblox, and Amazon.com services. Downdetector logged over 20,000 outage reports in hours. Despite the massive disruption, Amazon stock closed at $213.04, down just 0.68%, with pre-market trading at $212.27. Analysts say the outage underscores risks in cloud dependency but doesn’t immediately threaten Amazon’s stock. Investors remain cautiously optimistic ahead of the earnings report.

Title: BlackRock UK Bitcoin ETP Starts Trading in London After FCA Eases Crypto Ban

BlackRock debuted a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, one of a number of similar offerings that started trading after the Financial Conduct Authority ended a ban on retail investment imposed in 2021. In addition to the iShares Bitcoin ETP trading under the ticker IB1T, investors also gained access to products from companies including 21Shares, WisdomTree and Bitwise, which allow retail investors to buy exposure to bitcoin through a regulated market without needing to hold the cryptocurrency directly. BlackRock's product is already available elsewhere in Europe, having been listed on Xetra, Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris in late March according to the BlackRock’s page for the product. Switzerland-based 21Shares introduced four of its flagship crypto ETNs. These include its bitcoin (ABTC) and ether (AETH) staking products, as well as two lower-fee "Core” offerings, CBTC and ETHC, with management fees of 0.10%. “Today’s launch represents a landmark step for the U.K. market and for everyday investors who, for years, have been excluded from regulated crypto products,” 21Shares CEO Russel Barlow said in an emailed press release. Ending the ban “begins to level the playing field with Europe.” The WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs, which were previously available only to wealthy investors, are expected to be available through a range of U.K.-regulated investment platforms starting this week, the company said. Bitwise listed four ETPs on the LSE, two each tracking BTC and ETH. The firm said on Monday it was reducing the management fee of its Core Bitcoin ETP (BTC1) from 20 basis points to 5 bps for the next six months. BlackRock, which manages over $13 trillion in assets globally, has seen strong growth in its crypto-focused products. Its flagship bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has $85.5 billion in net assets according to SoSoValue data. This makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which has $21.9 billion in net assets.

Title: Ethereum Foundation Researcher’s Pivot Highlights Growing Cultural Divide in Crypto

Time Published: 2025-10-20T09:00:18Z
Full Content:
reading time 3 minutes On Friday, Ethereum Foundation Researcher Dankrad Feist announced he will be joining the stablecoin-focused blockchain startup Tempo, which was incubated via a partnership between fintech giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm. In response, some of the crypto purists on social media, most notably and understandably those who build on Ethereum, shared their disappointment, while others simply saw it as a sign of the times in terms of where the industry is headed more generally. Dankrad leaving Ethereum is a terrible look for open-source vs. corporate blockchains. Huge L for the entire community tbh — Andy (@ayyyeandy) October 17, 2025 The reaction to this recent move by Feist is an illustration of the greater cultural divide that has been growing in crypto over the past few years as more of this technology is built around increasingly centralized vectors of control. While Satoshi Nakamotoâs original Bitcoin whitepaper and other early writings discussed the need for a new system built on âcryptographic proof instead of trustâ and the problems with traditional systems being related to âall the trust thatâs required to make it work,â much of the more recent activity in crypto has involved centrally-issued stablecoins as poker chips in a meme coin casino. Much of the growth around crypto networks like Ethereum has been centered around centralized stablecoins, which operated in somewhat of a legal grey area in the U.S. prior to the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this year. With greater regulatory clarity established around these digital dollars, there has been an increase in various developments around so-called âstablechains,â which are focused on these bank-backed dollar tokens rather than crypto-native, permissionless assets. A fundamental problem with ETH valuation is that ethereum's primary uses cases are largely external to ETH's market value. Ethereum can be very useful, its apps can garner great revenue, and ETH can still be low price — or vice versa — there is little link between them. OTOH,â¦ — Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) October 7, 2025 Circle and Tether are the two largest stablecoin issuers via their respective USDC and USDT tokens. Earlier this year, Circle announced the creation of their own layer-one blockchain called Arc. Additionally, Tether and its affiliates have supported the development of at least two blockchains where USDT is the native gas token, namely Stable and Plasma. More well-known players in the fintech industry are also getting involved, with Coinbase, Stripe (Tempo), PayPal, and Robinhood all either announcing or already having launched their own blockchain platforms or other expansions into the crypto market. Google Cloud and Cloudflare also have their own blockchain offerings at different stages of development that are focused on payments for artificial intelligence agents. Some of these platforms are being built as secondary layers on top of Ethereum, while others are completely separate blockchain networks. As big tech giants and other notable players get involved in building out their own blockchain networks where they can have more control and extract more value, the cypherpunk values Satoshi wanted to infuse into Bitcoin, such as privacy and censorship resistance, have struggled to gain the hearts and minds of the general public. Sure, the bitcoin price recently hit a new all-time high once again (before subsequently dropping more than 15%); however, much of the recent bull run has been built around centralized, regulated financial products such as the publicly-traded exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the likes of BlackRock and bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy. There are still pockets of activity in crypto that are relatively faithful to the Satoshi vision. Not all use cases reintroduce trusted third parties by building everything around centralized stablecoins or throw away privacy by putting too much financial data on public blockchains. This is becoming an increasingly smaller percentage of overall activity, however, when compared to speculation on dubious token offerings or further empowering financial institutions with new technology that allows them to avoid strict anti-money laundering regulations as long as they put their customers on a database they call a blockchain. Bitcoin itself has remained somewhat resistant to corporate influence at the protocol level, as shown by the resolution of its internal block size warÂ back in 2017. However, Ethereumâs reliance on stablecoins is becoming an increasingly hard-to-ignore issue that is worth watching, as the issuers of these tokens have an incentive to use their centralized point of control to extract as much value as possible from this technology. As seen by the recent âstablechainâ phenomenon, this may include a desire to cut the open Ethereum network out of the picture entirely. Contrastly, Bitcoinâs main problematic point of centralization in terms of third-party custodians still requires those custodians to use the Bitcoin network. While people are still able to use these technologies in the permissionless, non-custodial manner Satoshi originally intended, the crypto industry as a whole is increasingly turning into a way for centralized financial entities to empower themselves rather than individual users.

Title: $600 Billion Could Flow Into Crypto From Wall Street: Galaxy Research
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/600-billion-inflow-crypto-wall-street-galaxy/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T09:00:10Z
Full Content:
Galaxy Research’s latest brief argues that the “wealth channel” in the United States—the network of roughly 300,000 financial advisors overseeing about $30 trillion in client assets—is finally starting to open to crypto assets, with implications that are both mechanical and potentially transformative. The crux of the thesis is arithmetic but not trivial: “If even a modest 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs emerged across this channel, that would translate to roughly $600 billion in potential inflows,” the note states, adding that such a sum “is comparable to the entire global gold ETF market (~$472 billion) and more than 3x the US spot bitcoin ETF AUM (~$146 billion).” The firm frames this as the moment crypto begins moving from retail-driven speculation toward advisor-led portfolio construction, as approvals, custody, and compliance guardrails converge inside the largest wirehouses and banks. The catalyst, in Galaxy’s telling, is a series of platform-level access changes and infrastructure buildouts that remove long-standing bottlenecks. On October 10, Morgan Stanley “removed longstanding restrictions on crypto fund access for its financial advisors,” allowing proactive recommendations “to all clients across any account type.” Galaxy highlights the bank’s newest house guidance—“up to 4%” of portfolios in digital assets—as a conservative but meaningful signal that crypto is being slotted alongside established diversifiers. The shift matters less as a branding exercise and more as a workflow change: when exposure becomes standard inside advisory toolkits, it can be modeled, rebalanced, and supervised under the same risk and suitability processes that govern equities, bonds, and alternatives. The research brief stresses how the wealth channel’s internal approval machinery has been the real gating factor. Advisors “can only allocate to products formally approved by their firms,” and those approvals depend on “custody readiness, compliance frameworks, operational integration, and client suitability standards.” Crypto has lagged not because advisors lack interest, Galaxy argues, but because “approval of crypto products has been especially cautious” amid volatility, evolving regulation, and a limited on-platform track record. That calculus is changing as banks build the “critical backbone” internally—trading, custody, and advisory systems that let them “offer secure, scalable crypto access through their wealth platforms.” In the same vein, the note flags movement among the largest brand names in US asset management and banking. Vanguard—long the archetype of crypto skepticism—“is reportedly preparing to offer select third-party crypto ETFs to its brokerage clients,” a reversal Galaxy attributes to “strong client demand and a more supportive regulatory climate,” while noting that there is “not yet [a] specific timeline or which ETFs will be made available.” Citi, for its part, “plans to launch institutional-grade crypto custody in 2026,” and JPMorgan “signaled that its clients will soon be able to trade bitcoin and other crypto assets,” albeit without in-house custody for now. Galaxy treats these moves less as isolated headlines than as evidence that banks intend to capture crypto flows “using their own integrated trading, custody, and advisory systems” to provide regulated access at scale. Policy context also features in Galaxy’s analysis. The brief points to the recent executive order allowing 401(k) plans to include crypto as an option” as a legitimizing step that helps fiduciaries and compliance teams grow comfortable with the risk profile of digital assets inside retirement plans. While implementation ultimately depends on how plan sponsors interpret fiduciary obligations, Galaxy’s point is that headline regulatory posture is no longer exclusively restrictive—reducing a key narrative and operational headwind for wealth platforms. Importantly, Galaxy situates the prospective 2% allocation within a broader spectrum of public guidance from prominent allocators over the past year. The firm notes that “BlackRock, Fidelity, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, and Ric Edelman have publicly suggested crypto allocations ranging from a conservative 1% to as high as 40% in aggressive scenarios.” Within this range, Morgan Stanley’s “up to 4%” ceiling is neither fringe nor maximalist; it reads as a risk-budgeted sleeve for an asset class the bank now describes as “both a hedge against inflation and a long-term growth opportunity.” Galaxy extends the math: if average allocations across advised assets land closer to 1% than 2%, bitcoin ETF assets could still reach “$500 billion within a few years.” The bottom line: If advisors can finally “integrate crypto directly into traditional balanced portfolios,” the firm concludes, the industry will likely look back on this period as the point “where crypto transitions from a niche investment to a standard portfolio component, alongside equities, bonds, and gold.” At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $3.71 trillion.

ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG Krist Boo Published Oct 20, 2025, 04:14 AM Updated Oct 20, 2025, 07:13 AM SINGAPORE – Software engineers in Singapore are less likely than their global peers to lose their jobs to artificial intelligence (AI), owing to strong government support and the Republic’s proximity to an array of tech firms, say talent and technology players. The rise of vibe coding – where one can build apps and websites using word commands – is especially ominous for this group of computer experts. vibe coding Mr Eugene Yang, managing director for Singapore and Hong Kong at technology consultancy Palo IT, said the signs are that companies here are already reducing demand for junior developers, traditionally hired through offshore markets such as India, Vietnam, the Philippines and China. But Singapore’s smaller, more specialised tech workforce offers an opportunity. He said: “We could emerge as the AI orchestration hub for South-east Asia, managing AI agents rather than human coders.” Managing AI agents – bots that can work and learn independently without human supervision – to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks is beginning to draw attention among enterprises. Ms Rohini Saluja, managing director at real estate services firm CBRE, said the AI orchestration layer is where human oversight, ethical design and complex system integration are needed. These areas play up Singapore’s strengths – but offshore information technology (IT) offices will not disappear, she said. She noted: “Take an example of data labelling for AI training. Despite improvements in optical character recognition technology, companies continue to value quality, accuracy and the human lens for such data. “Such roles will not be feasible in higher-cost markets.” Likewise, Mr Ravi Nippani, head of regional industries and solutions at professional services firm Mercer Asia, expects businesses here to keep using offshore teams. These remote teams offer specialised skills and scale for large IT projects, as well as personalised customer interactions. They also help businesses spread their geographical operation risks. “Companies should not rush to cut offshore IT offices but rather consider transforming their offshore teams,” Mr Nippani advised. For instance, offshore offices could be upgraded from routine coding to higher-value tasks such as AI management, complex problem-solving and system design, he said. Singapore is home to around 4,500 tech firms, including the regional operations of major global tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. Director for AI innovation at AI Singapore Laurence Liew expects firms to bring some of their overseas roles home when Singapore is able to offer enough AI workers at competitive wage levels. The Government has a goal to have 15,000 AI professionals in the workforce before 2029, and is supporting it with apprenticeships, scholarships, reskilling initiatives and public-private collaborations. a goal to have 15,000 AI professionals in the workforce before 2029 It has launched programmes such as the Skills Pathway for Cloud, offered by the Singapore Computer Society in collaboration with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and SkillsFuture Singapore; IMDA’s Tech Immersion and Placement Programme; and AI Singapore’s AI Apprenticeship Programme. Skills Pathway for Cloud, Tech Immersion and Placement Programme; AI Singapore’s AI Apprenticeship Programme Mr Liew said software engineers everywhere are using AI or agentic coding tools today. AI Singapore’s apprenticeship initiative aims to give the local workforce an edge by injecting AI workers with diverse backgrounds into the economy. He said: “Not all are software or computer science graduates, which makes the programme all the more valuable, as they bring their past domain experience to solve business problems.” Almost all its trainees, ranging from fresh graduates to mid-career job switchers, are hired within six months of graduation. About six in 10 find jobs before graduation, he added. The programme will produce more than 500 graduates over 20 cohorts by the middle of 2026. While engineers here are already expected to be more productive with the help of AI coding tools, higher salaries are not in the offing for now, said Mr Ethan Ang, chief executive of tech career platform NodeFlair. “The market remains employer-driven, especially after the wave of tech layoffs, and companies generally view AI adoption as a way to improve competitiveness and efficiency, rather than as a justification for higher salary negotiations,” he said. NodeFlair estimates that 80,000 to 100,000 of the 214,000 tech workers in Singapore are software engineers and developers making a median monthly salary of $6,750. Regional director John Borneman of recruitment firm Hays expects median salaries for this group to stay flat in the next 12 months. But he expects the ones who have upskilled to command more pay. “The rise of low-code platforms is reducing the need for teams writing boilerplate code, so the more skilled you are in architecture and modelling, the greater value you will add to an organisation, and the bigger the upside for your pay packet,” he said.

Title: $200B AppLovin faces data privacy probe after short-sellers allege misconduct: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/10/19/business/applovin-faces-data-privacy-probe-after-short-sellers-allege-misconduct-sources/
Time Published: 2025-10-19T17:58:32Z
Full Content:
Fast-growing tech giant AppLovin is facing fresh regulatory heat over its handling of consumer data –including potential investigations by multiple state attorneys general, The Post has learned. The Silicon Valley firm – a mobile advertising juggernaut worth more than $200 billion that made headlines this spring with an offer to buy TikTok – was rocked this month by a reported Securities and Exchange Commission probe over data privacy. The SEC is investigating whether AppLovin “misled investors about its data collection and ad-targeting methods” after short-sellers alleged it had used digital “fingerprints” to improperly track users for targeted ads, according to Bloomberg. On Wednesday, AppLovin said it shut down a product called “Array” that an ad researcher claimed downloaded apps onto user’s phones without their consent. The disclosure came days after researcher Ben Edelman, who holds a short position on AppLovin, claimed in an Oct. 13 report to have found source code that enabled forced downloads. Edelman’s allegations remain unsubstantiated. A rep for AppLovin responded that “users must explicitly consent to download an application as a result of any of our ads,” noting that “Array was a test product.” Meanwhile, state regulators, including staff from the attorneys general from Delaware, Oregon and Connecticut, have reached out to multiple short sellers, seemingly as part of a preliminary investigation into AppLovin, according to sources close to the situation and emails reviewed by The Post. The probe, which apparently began in March and continued through the summer, is focused on AppLovin’s data collection practices, according to sources familiar with the investigation. Delaware has taken the lead on the probe, which is thought to be in its early stages, sources said. Several third-party data brokers with ties to AppLovin have received subpoenas as part of the probe, the sources added. “We do not comment on, confirm, or deny investigations,” a spokesperson for the Delaware attorney general’s office said. When provided a detailed list of questions for comment, AppLovin said it is “not engaged in any investigations with any state attorneys general regarding its business; nor has the Company been contacted by any state attorneys general regarding any such alleged investigation.” “AppLovin operates an advertising platform with industry-consistent, platform policies and enforcement measures regarding, among other things, ad content,” the company added in a statement. “These platform policies and measures apply to both publishers and demand side users (i.e., advertisers), and specifically address things like explicit content and other ad content.’ In addition to any local data privacy and consumer protection laws, states have enforcement authority under the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law meant to shield online users 13 or younger. In 2023, a coalition of 33 states sued Meta alleging violations of COPPA. It couldn’t be learned if the state investigators were focused on potential violations of COPPA or any other specific law in their probe. So far, the allegations have done little to slow the meteoric rise of AppLovin, which has been fueled by interest in its AI-powered software that helps app developers find new users and sell advertising. The company, which claims to have built a better mousetrap in an ad tech sector long dominated by Meta and Google, has seen shares surge 80% this year and was recently added to the S&P 500. Founded in 2012 by CEO Adam Foroughi, John Krystynak and Andrew Karam, AppLovin was originally centered on mobile gaming, but has increasingly refocused its business on its app monetization software. AppLovin’s rapid rise was threatened in February by a slew of short seller reports published by firms including Fuzzy Panda Research, Muddy Waters and Culper Research. AppLovin has denied the claims in these reports. In its bombshell analysis, Fuzzy Panda alleged that AppLovin “appears to be illegally tracking children” in violation of federal law – in part by assigning unique digital “fingerprints” to underage accounts specifically labeled “do not track” and despite Apple and Google policies prohibiting the practice. Fuzzy Panda also published evidence that AppLovin allegedly served explicit and violent third-party animated ads despite parental controls being activated. Those included one that depicted a scantily clad woman being spanked by her boss and another showing an elderly grandmother being attacked with a cleaver. In the report that allegedly contributed to the probe, Fuzzy Panda said it set up a dummy account for a 10-year-old boy to test AppLovin’s alleged data tracking – and found that the firm assigned a unique ID tracking the account as it played games titled “Save The Girl!” and “Mr. Bullet 3D.” Fuzzy Panda accused AppLovin of combining those identifiers with data from third-party brokers to “enhance the fingerprint and effectively track children” in violation of federal law. In the report, Fuzzy Panda said its analysis of an old but still-accessible software development kit used by AppLovin revealed the firm was “collecting 50 different attributes from children’s devices including (geolocation data; unique device identification; and even the exact boot-up time to millisecond” that could be used to specify which users in a household were kids. The Post could not independently verify the analysis. Apple explicitly bars developers from “fingerprinting” users, underage or otherwise, in its terms of service, as did Google until it tweaked the policy in February. Culper Research alleged on Feb. 26 that it had uncovered evidence that AppLovin had “systematically deployed, then exploited incredibly dangerous app permissions that enable in-app ads themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations directly onto users’ phones, with just a single click.” Culper cited research by Edelman, who later released his own report this month in which he compiled more than 200 user complaints about alleged forced downloads linked to AppLovin’s Array product, including cases where users reportedly noticed apps downloading without a notification as they watched an ad on their phone. Foroughi previously denied short seller allegations of wrongdoing in a Feb 26 blog post, writing that the company does not track kids’ data and is compliant with all app store rules. “It’s disappointing that a few nefarious short-sellers are making false and misleading claims aimed at undermining our success, and driving down our stock price for their own financial gain, rather than acknowledging the sophisticated AI models our team has built to enhance advertising for our partners,” Foroughani said at the time. When reached for comment for this story, an AppLovin rep reiterated that the short seller reports are “false and misleading” made by parties with “clear financial motivations,” and contradicted by “third party sources” as well as the company’s own statements. The allegations against AppLovin emerged as Congress steps up its efforts to protect kids online in response to several major scandals in which underage users were exposed to harmful content or privacy violations. Earlier this year, Senate lawmakers reintroduced an updated version of COPPA, which would bar targeted ads for people under age 17. Other legal challenges are brewing, including a suit by a California resident who claims that AppLovin tracked her “purchasing decisions, app usage…her movements and locations” without her permission and despite her turning off location tracking software on her phone. The complaint alleges that AppLovin continued to track her using reverse IP look-up technology and “monetized” her information to “unknown third parties.” Advertisement

The emailed version of this newsletter includes polls, including one this week that asks readers what they think the best business model is for autonomous vehicle technology. Have an opinion about this? Email me your opinion at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com with the subject line “AV poll.” OK, back to the show. There’s another twist in the road for lidar company Luminar. And yes, it includes some inside-the-boardroom intrigue. First, let’s catch up. You might recall that Austin Russell, the billionaire founder and CEO of Luminar, was more or less pushed out of the company by its board following an ethics inquiry. But Russell didn’t go quietly into the night. He popped back up on our radar a few weeks ago with the launch of a new company called Russell AI Labs. And now (cue the deep and foreboding “dum dum duuuuummmm”): He has made a bid to acquire Luminar. Senior reporter Sean O’Kane broke the story, which you can read here. He has since learned a few more details beyond what is disclosed in the SEC filing. This may look like a possible hostile move — it was, after all, disclosed in a filing from Russell, and Luminar is not commenting on the proposal. But we’ve learned from a source that members of Luminar’s board approached the founder about the idea last month. (The word we were told was they “encouraged” it.) The implication here is that some of Luminar’s nine-member board really does want him back, despite the fact that three of those board members on the audit committee conducted an ethics inquiry into him just a few months ago, leading to his resignation. The proposed takeover as described in the filing is vague, but it could involve Russell AI Labs acquiring a different automotive tech company and merging it with Luminar. Since this morning, we’ve heard Russell is already trained on a few options as part of the diligence he’s done with Russell AI Labs, which he views as an incubator of sorts. Two notable deals this week occurred in the electric aviation sector. First up is Beta Technologies, which took advantage of eased SEC rules during the U.S. government shutdown to price shares for its initial public offering. The shares are priced between $27 and $33, in hopes of raising as much as $825 million. If the company attracts investors at the top of that range, it will debut with a valuation of about $7.2 billion. The SEC issued guidance earlier this month that lets companies in IPO limbo allow their statements on certain areas, including share price, to become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule. And there is Lilium, which was involved in a very different kind of deal. The electric aircraft startup may have ceased operations a year ago, but its tech is living on over at Archer Aviation. Archer won a competitive bidding process — one that Ambitious Air Mobility Group and Joby Aviation also participated in — and bought all 300 of Lilium’s patents. The price, €18 million ($21 million), is a stunning number when compared to the more than $1 billion the defunct startup raised over its lifetime. The question is what does Archer plan to do with these patents? The company isn’t explicit, but there are some hints, which you can read about in my story. Other deals that got my attention this week … Airbound, an Indian drone startup founded in 2020, raised $8.65 million in seed funding led by Physical Intelligence co-founder Lachy Groom. Humba Ventures and Airbound’s existing investor, Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as senior leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, and Anduril, joined. Dexory, a warehouse robotics startup based in London, raised $165 million in equity and debt. The $100 million Series C round was led by Eurazeo with participation from backers LTS Growth, Endeavor Catalyst, DTCP, Atomico, Lakestar, Elaia, Latitude Ventures, and Wave-X. The company also secured $65 million in debt financing from Bootstrap Europe. FleetWorks, a logistics startup developing an “always-on” AI dispatcher, raised $17 million in equity and debt, including a $15 million Series A round led by First Round Capital’s Bill Trenchard. Y Combinator, Saga Ventures, and LFX Venture Partners also participated in the FleetWorks Series A. Pony.ai and WeRide have received a key approval from Chinese securities regulators that clears the way for the autonomous vehicle technology companies to pursue secondary listings on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The Chinese companies are already publicly traded in the U.S. on the Nasdaq Exchange. Starship Technologies, the autonomous sidewalk delivery startup, raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Plural. Karma.vc, Latitude, Coefficient Capital, SmartCap, and Skaala also joined. Upciti, a Paris-based smart city software company, raised $20 million in Series A funding led by Notion Capital. Other investors included Point Nine and Chalfen Ventures. Zepto, the Indian grocery delivery company, raised $450 million in funding ahead of a public listing set, Bloomberg reported. The National Transportation Safety Board has weighed in on OceanGate, the disaster that killed five people during a voyage to view the wreckage of the Titanic. The NTSB issued a report that found the Titan submersible did not meet manufacturing safety standards. Stellantis and Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai are working together to build robotaxis for use in Europe, albeit via a nonbinding agreement. The plan is to integrate Pony’s self-driving software into Stellantis’ electric medium-size van platform. While Stellantis delves into autonomous vehicle tech, it is pulling back on electrification. The automaker said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years. (This plan hasn’t been well received by labor unions in Canada, by the way.) Five new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Only one of those will be electrified, a marked difference from Stellantis’ strategy a few years ago. Uber is offering a new kind of gig work: digital tasks like uploading photos to help train AI models. Waymo is expanding to London. The company said it will offer a commercial robotaxi service in London in 2026, marking the Alphabet-owned company’s second international expansion following Tokyo. As per usual, there was more than one piece of Waymo news. The company locked in a strategic multiyear agreement with DoorDash to deliver goods to customers in the Phoenix area using driverless vehicles. It’s been a while since Waymo has experimented with delivery. Is this a hint of what’s to come? I believe it is. Speaking of Waymo and delivery, it got me thinking about what the best business model is. It’s been a minute since we’ve had a poll, so I hope you participate if you sign up for the newsletter.

by Michael Levanduski TikTok, Shutterstock TikTok, Shutterstock Everyone knows about inflation, and shrinkflation, and a dozen other ways that big companies are trying to boost their profits. This TikToker is shining a light on a whole new method that has been called ‘trickflation,’ and I’m sure you’ve seen it before. He starts his video by saying, “There’s an exciting new way that you’re being ripped off at the grocery store! You’ve, of course, heard of shrinkflation, where manufacturers take an existing product and just shrink it a little bit. Without applying that same shrinkage to the price. You might have even heard of skimpflation, where companies keep the size and the price the same, but just switch out those pesky expensive ingredients for much cheaper ones.” It is a never-ending battle trying to save money. TikTok/earlypete He then introduces the next way they try to get you, “But the new way the grocery industry has tried to screw us is what one Reddit user calls trickflation. You see, they haven’t reduced the amount of soda. Both of these cans are still 12oz. But since the grocery industry thinks the average consumer has the intelligence of a six-year-old child, they’ve put that same 12oz of soda in what looks like a larger can.” Why am I not surprised? Make people think they are getting more when they actually aren’t. TikTok/earlypete He continues, “No, of course, this trickflation only works if they eliminate the previous can, and jack up the price. Which is, of course, exactly what they did.” Great, so it is basically just raising prices with extra steps. TikTok/earlypete He finishes his video by saying, “So, not only do we have to worry about our products shrinking in size, or using ingredients of much lower quality, but we now have to worry about what is almost indisputably deceptive behavior.” They will do anything to keep their profit margins up. Hopefully, people will wise up to this and start shopping with companies that don’t do this type of thing. But I doubt it. Watch the full video below to see what you think. If it didn’t make me so angry, I would honestly be impressed with the creativity the grocery industry comes up with to rip us off #foodfacts#groceryhaul#exposed ♬ In The Hall Of The Mountain King/Grieg – もつ The people in the comments totally support this video. Check them out for yourself. This commenter says those cans actually cost more, too. I mean, this person isn’t wrong. Oh yes, a classic. Just keep paying more, you’ll keep getting less. If you liked that story, check out this one about a Costco customer who got their cart stolen… so she hatched a plan to get it back!

Title: S&P 500 Earnings Surge: Magnificent 7 Lead As Recession Odds Plunge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/10/19/sp-500-earnings-surge-magnificent-7-lead-as-recession-odds-plunge/

ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its third-busiest week, which includes an earnings report from one of the Magnificent 7. 88 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Coca-Cola (KO), 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC), and Procter & Gamble (PG). With relatively few companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 8.5% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 11.0%, and for 2026, it is 13.9%. A strong start to earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Bank earnings were well above expectations, sending the expected year-over-year earnings growth rate for the financials sector to 18.2%. However, there was a scare after some smaller banks, Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), reported loan fraud. Additionally, JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, warned of “cockroaches” in the credit market on his earnings conference call. The mega-banks, JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), can offset small loan losses thanks to robust trading and investment banking revenues. Still, the smaller regional banks don’t have that luxury, causing the regional bank stock index to plunge while the large bank index is sharply higher for the year. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7 are expected to grow earnings by 14.9% year-over-year in the third quarter, while the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 should grow at 6.7%. The first of the Magnificent 7, Tesla (TSLA), is scheduled to report results this week. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises by Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Travelers Companies (TRV), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 last week. The blended earnings growth rate for the financials sector increased to 18.2% from 13.2%. The energy sector is expected to experience the most significant year-over-year earnings decline due to lower oil prices. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 6.6% is above expectations. Consistent with the earnings picture, energy-sector revenues should see the most significant year-over-year decline. The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter last year. On the margin, this should benefit companies’ international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. With almost no US economic releases on the calendar due to the government shutdown, the focus will be on earnings. In addition to being the third-busiest week of earnings reports this season, the breadth of companies reporting is expanding further beyond the banks. Despite the lack of government economic reports and the government shutdown, the economy is holding up just fine, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 5%. Economic and market sentiment was helped last week by President Trump indicating that the massive tariffs on China were unsustainable and Fed Chair Powell reinforcing the case for two more rate cuts this year. As the earnings season heats up beyond the financials, earnings will be monitored closely. Given the additional economic visibility issues due to the government shutdown, forward earnings guidance from management will be even more closely watched.

Title: The AI revolution's next casualty could be the gig economy

A woman who's been driving for Uber for more than a decade explains how she's looking for new work as her pay drops. Tomorrow's the big launch of First Trade, our new markets newsletter led by Joe Ciolli. Subscribe here! On the agenda today: But first: There's a new gig in town. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The gig economy is facing a reckoning. Two stories this past week caught my eye. Uber unveiled a new way for its drivers to earn money. No, not by giving rides, but by helping train the ride-sharing company's AI models instead. On the same day, Waymo announced a partnership with DoorDash to test driverless grocery and meal deliveries. Both moves point toward the same future: one where the very workers who built the gig economy may soon find themselves training the technology that replaces them. Uber's new program allows drivers to earn cash by completing microtasks, such as taking photos and uploading audio clips, that aim to improve the company's AI systems. For drivers, it's a way to diversify income. For Uber, it's a way to accelerate its automated future. There's an irony here. By helping Uber strengthen its AI, drivers could be accelerating the very driverless world they fear. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said human drivers won't vanish overnight. Still, he has warned that the eventual decline of driving jobs poses a significant societal challenge to the gig economy. Uber already offers autonomous rides in Waymo vehicles in Atlanta and Austin, and plans to expand. Meanwhile, Waymo is rolling out its pilot partnership with DoorDash, starting in Phoenix. DashMart stores are expected to be the first retailer on the platform. BI reported that customers may be asked to pay a delivery charge — just like they would for typical DoorDash orders — but there will be no need to tip the driver because, well, there's no driver. All of this is ripe fodder for a virtual event Business Insider is hosting on Wednesday, where we'll explore how AI and automation are reshaping the self-driving revolution. I'll be speaking with automotive innovators, AI experts, and urban mobility leaders. The best part about the event — it's free! Hope to see you there. AI startup Friend offers a $129 necklace that aims to help solve the loneliness crisis by going with you everywhere. If the oft-graffitied subway ads are any indication, New Yorkers aren't buying it. BI's Amanda Hoover tested out the necklace for a week. While the bot could hold a conversation, Hoover wasn't convinced it really counted as a friend. What it got wrong about friendship. Also read: Last month, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban joined the ranks of broken-up couples where the woman outearns the man. That particular ending is more common than you may think. Divorce rates for heterosexual couples go up when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, and they go down when the opposite is true. It shows how women's economic progress is clashing with old expectations about marriage, an executive coach said. But it doesn't mean your marriage is doomed. As of this month, the Nvidia CEO has 36 direct reports, according to an internal list obtained by BI. The list offers a glimpse into the group of leaders at the top of the world's most valuable company. Last year, Huang said he had 55 direct reports. He's known for having many people report into him, and has said it helps with information flow. Here's who's reporting to Huang. Amazon Web Services is feeling a shift in one of its biggest clientele segments, according to internal documents obtained by BI. Startups, which typically allocate a significant portion of their budgets to AWS, are instead spending it on AI tools. "Founders tell us they seek to adopt AWS at a later stage," the company warned in one of the documents. The shift represents a massive threat to AWS, which holds a firm grip on the lucrative startup ecosystem. More on Cloud 2.0. This week's quote: "When a brand becomes iconic, simplicity is the ultimate flex." — Matt Sia, executive creative director at design services firm Pearlfisher, on Apple TV ditching the plus sign. How Arizona tea has kept its 99-cent price tag Iced tea cans from Arizona Beverages have had the same price point since 1992. That famous price tag was once under threat, though.

Title: What to Expect in Markets This Week: CPI Inflation Data; Tesla, Netflix, Intel Earnings

Trade is the talk of the town this week. Investors will be watching for updates on trade policy ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping, as well as a highly anticipated inflation reading, after a volatile week of trading marked by worries about bad loans at regional banks. Friday’s release of the Consumer Price Index for September, delayed by the government shutdown, is likely the last major piece of data the Federal Reserve will receive before its interest rate decision next week. Other government reports could remain delayed until there is a resolution to the budget dispute in Washington. Magnificent 7 member Tesla is set to report earnings Wednesday, when CEO Elon Musk could offer more details on the electric vehicles maker's advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, after a torrid rally in recent months. Intel’s report will be in focus after a flurry of investments in the struggling chipmaker boosted its stock. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Tesla’s scheduled earnings release Wednesday follows stronger-than-expected deliveries as buyers rushed to take advantage of expiring EV tax credits. Big Three automakers Ford and General Motors, also set to report this week, likely benefited from the same tailwinds, though both automakers have scaled back their EV ambitions. Tesla CEO Elon Musk could offer more details on developments in the company's high-tech offerings beyond EVs, including an expansion of its robotaxi services, its Optimus robots, and self-driving technology. Intel’s report, due Thursday, comes as the U.S. chipmaker’s shares have surged after a string of deals including one that saw the U.S. government take a stake and a partnership with AI leader Nvidia. Netflix’s report comes after the streamer recently raised its prices and boosted its revenue outlook. Updates from Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble could bring some insights into consumer spending, while Friday’s earnings from HCA Healthcare may offer a look into the hospital sector. Gold miner Newmont’s report on Thursday arrives as the precious metal has set a string of new all-time highs . With many economic reports in limbo due to the federal shutdown, Friday's CPI inflation report could be the last major piece of economic data the Fed gets before issuing a decision on interest rates next week. Forecasters expect the report to show prices continuing to rise, but at a slower pace than in August. The data could influence whether the Fed will continue with its plans to keep lowering interest rates. Fed officials have said their focus is turning to the weakening labor market, which would favor rate cuts. But higher-than-expected inflation could push them to reconsider. While the release of new home sales data is likely to be delayed, market watchers will still see on Thursday the National Association of Realtors’ existing home sales data for September, as economists look for signs of a resurgence in an anemic housing market. The week will also bring fresh figures on consumer sentiment and Purchasing Managers Index surveys for October. Quick Links: Recap Last Week’s Trading | Latest Markets News Monday, Oct. 20 Tuesday, Oct. 21 Wednesday, Oct. 22 Thursday, Oct. 23 Friday, Oct. 24 Banking fees are rising at one major bank, with new waiver rules for checking accounts taking effect this month.

Hideo Kojima recently shared an optimistic view on artificial intelligence, framing it not as a threat to the games industry or to human creativity for that matter, but a collaborative “friend’ that can handle the more time-consuming aspects of game development. In a recent interview with Wired Japan, Kojima highlighted that while many in the industry use AI to generate ideas, he views it differently, stating: “A lot of people use AI in creative work to come up with ideas. But I think of AI as more of a friend… I would lead the creative part and use AI to boost efficiency.” Kojima’s perspective on the use of AI and its role in creative workflows comes amid a time when many companies like Activision, Level-5, and Capcom are using AI. A recent survey in June and July found that 32% of CESA member companies are using AI to develop in-house game engines, extend to visual game assets, generate text, and assist in programming. It’s pretty surprising how much of a foothold AI already has in gaming, considering some companies have been quite open about their use of AI in pretty much everything from visual upscaling to code generation, even as user and developer pushback continues on multiple mediums. Kojima's approach shows how AI can be used to streamline monotonous tasks such as animation, motion capture, and NPC behaviors without supplanting the core creative process in video game development. He further added in the Wired interview, saying, I’d like AI to handle the tedious tasks. That would lower the cost and cut down on time. It’s more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it. I see a future where I stay one step ahead, creating together with AI. Kojima’s stance on the use of AI stands in stark contrast to the push toward full automation in some sectors, maintaining AI as a tool for efficiency rather than a complete substitute. For instance, during the development of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Kojima Productions employed machine learning for scanning actors, including Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna, to create digital models. While Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has been praised for its high-fidelity visuals, realistic character models, and facial animations, Kojima himself views the result as merely “okay” and seeks even greater realism in future endeavors like OD and Physint. At the New Global Sport Conference in Riyadh in August, he discussed a few challenges during Death Stranding 2’s production, and mentioned: We scanned and we made a rig, an AI machine learning rig. We took so much time and made sure that we scanned them into digital, but made sure that they move analog in a way. And it took so much time. Looking back, I think it’s okay. But my next project, I think I want to make it more realistic. Debates over the use of AI in the game industry continue unabated, even as it remains the leading cause for layoffs in an industry struggling to find sustained profitability. While some developers are aiming for total automation, Kojima’s vision for using AI as a co-creator could help reduce game development costs, while making sure humans remain at the helm of innovation.Buy Death Stranding 2: On The Beach on Amazon Wired - Instagram

Title: Banjo-Kazooie director Gregg Mayles leaves Rare after 36 years as he announces exit on X

Gregg Mayles, the director behind Banjo-Kazooie, has finally bid farewell to Rare after an impressive 36 years at the British studio. Mayles, who joined Rare in 1989 straight out of high school, announced his exit on X in poetic alliteration, titled “A Rather Resplendent Rewarding Rare Ramble,” fittingly referencing the rhyming dialogue that defined Banjo-Kazooie. The poem basically recounts his journey, from his early days ignoring banking for game design to contributing to hits like Battletoads, Donkey Kong Country, Diddy Kong Racing, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, Viva Piñata, and Sea of Thieves, while expressing gratitude to fans and colleagues. He ended the post with the line “Now time to start new tales to tell, Farewell to Rare, he waves, farewell!” Over his tenure, Mayles worked on 30 games, helping shape Rare’s golden era during the Nintendo 64 heyday. He contributed to classics such as the 1998 platformer Banjo-Kazooie, which sold over 3.6 million copies worldwide and spawned sequels like Banjo-Tooie in 2000. He also contributed to many other beloved titles, including the 1994 beat ‘em up Battletoads, the Donkey Kong series starting with Donkey Kong Country in 1994, the 2003 Xbox horror-comedy Grabbed by the Ghoulies, the 2006 life sim Viva Pinata, and most recently, directed the live-service hit pirate adventure multiplayer game, Sea of Thieves, which launched in 2018 and has since amassed more than 40 million players across all platforms. This announcement comes amid a turbulent and dark period for Rare, following Microsoft’s acquisition of the studio in 2002 for $375 million, after which it shifted focus from Nintendo to Xbox. While Sea of Thieves stands as Rare’s most successful release, the studio had nonetheless faced many hiccups throughout the years, like 2013's Kinect Sports. Notable here is ambitious open-world adventure Everwild, whose development was being overseen by Gregg Mayles himself. The game was announced in 2019 and had been in development for over five years. However, Microsoft canceled Everwild in July 2025 as part of broader layoffs, affecting up to 9000 employees company-wide. This also included cuts at Rare and the scrapping of The Initiative's Perfect Dark Reboot, another project tied to Rare’s legacy. Sources report that the cancellation of Everwild, after nearly a decade of troubled development and multiple reboots, likely influenced Mayles' decision to leave Rare. However, he didn’t specify the reason in his post on X. Gregg Mayles - X

Title: 'Deploying More Capital — Steady Lads': Bitcoin Treasury Companies Struggle to Halt Plunge
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/18/deploying-more-capital-steady-lads-bitcoin-treasury-companies-struggle-to-halt-crash
Time Published: 2025-10-18T17:00:00Z
Full Content:
Is crypto winter coming? It's already more than set in for bitcoin treasury companies (BTCTC). Aiming to replicate the once-in-a-generation success of Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR) and perhaps taking advantage of a U.S. regulatory regime that is willing to look the other way at questionable public offerings, a wave of crypto asset treasury companies have gone public in 2025. The result has been massive investor losses nearly across the board. And while the plunge in the price of bitcoin BTC$110,317.97 over the past 11 days (yes, it was only Monday, Oct. 3 when BTC peaked above $126,000) can be blamed for some of the carnage, BTCTC share prices were tumbling well prior to that. Checking a small group of BTCTCs, losses over the past three months range from "just" 38% in the case of Strategy to 94% for KindlyMD (NAKA). As his TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin began de-pegging from the dollar in May 2022, Do Kwon famously tweeted, "Deploying more capital — steady lads." Within days, TerraUSD, which had previously commanded a market cap of about $50 billion, was worthless. That social media post has gone on to become a meme for the crypto community whenever things start to look questionable for the markets or any companies. This isn't to suggest any level of comparable shiftiness or criminality, or to predict the future BTCTCs, but some of the executive teams at these firms have recently been uber-busy on social networks in defense of their business models. Simon Gerovich, CEO of Japan's Metaplanet (MTPLF) — which remains higher since it adopted the BTCTC strategy in 2024, but has had a 70% share price decline over the past three months — on Friday attempted to make the case for why a shift to preferred stock issuance will deliver strong returns to shareholders. "When bitcoin appreciates faster than the cost of capital, that difference compounds into greater bitcoin per share and the benefit accrues to the common shareholders," he said in a post on X. The tl;dr: Metaplanet investors will benefit if "number go up." KindlyMD CEO David Bailey — whose 94% share plunge over the past three months has left the stock price below $1 and in danger of being delisted by the Nasdaq — on Thursday found it necessary to deny the claims of an X poster that his company had "FTX vibes." "In no way is there any similarity to FTX," said Bailey. "We’re a regulated, registered security that buys and holds bitcoin." When the CEO of publicly traded company has to respond to a random s--tposter to say "we're not FTX," it's safe to say the plot may have been lost. Then there was Strive (ASST) CIO Ben Werkman — whose share price plunge has nearly matched that of NAKA and also faces delisting danger — attempting to explain the difficulties and a way forward. "Now the exuberance is gone, and many companies are now in position with their balance sheets intact to be able to move to the second phase of the journey," said Werkman in an extremely long post to X. "Achieving scale is difficult, but now many companies have it," he continued. "Valuations are reaching what I would consider deep value territory (just based on balance sheets alone), and these are the valuations where many investors will place their bets for the long term." Werkman went on to remind that many assumed Saylor's Strategy (then MicroStrategy) was going to zero in 2022's crypto winter. Those who faded that assumption were rewarded with mind-boggling returns. MSTR was trading at about $30 when Do Kwon made his "steady lads" post. Even after their recent decline, the shares are still at $290 — or nearly a 10-bagger over the last three and a half years. Whatever the future may hold for the BTCTCs, one thing is for sure: the vibes are anything but positive at the moment. If any of the latecomers are going to mirror the massive success of first mover Strategy, it could require a lot more than just a rising bitcoin price.

Title: Ready To Retire? These 8%+ CEFs Show The Way
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/10/18/ready-to-retire-these-8-cefs-show-the-way/
Time Published: 2025-10-18T15:11:00Z

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I’m regularly struck by something American investors always seem to take for granted: The many choices we have available to gain financial independence. And investors in closed-end funds (CEFs) make the most of these choices. These high-yielding funds kick out 8%+ dividends on average, and the portfolio of my CEF Insider service, which helps investors make the most of CEFs, pays even more, with its 18 holdings paying a rich average yield of 9.4%. Plus, these funds offer stock-like upside, which makes them pretty much tailor-made for delivering financial freedom. We’ll sketch out how two specific CEFs can help you find your way to an earlier, richer retirement in a bit. But first, back to that embarrassment of choices I mentioned a second ago. Back in my 20s, when I was studying to get my PhD in Europe, I was told I had to pay into the national pension fund, and I would get that money back when I qualified for it. At that time, I qualified at 62, which seemed absurd—nearly 40 years for me (a severely underpaid academic!) to get back money I desperately needed today. But as it turns out, I was lucky. Europe’s mandatory retirement age is rising. Denmark, which currently has the oldest retirement age in Europe at 67, is raising that to 70. Germany, where a normal retirement age is currently 66, is discussing raising that to 73. Whether you like the life of a worker or not, I’m almost certain that you like having the ability to choose that life without having to worry about governments changing the rules on you mid-game. This lack of choice pushed me away from Europe in my 20s and led me back to America. Here’s what I found when I returned. This chart shows that the average American household has gone from $200k in savings in the 1980s to $1.2 million now—and, no, that isn’t due to inflation. That $200k in savings would be $535k in 2025 dollars, so more than half of the jump to $1.2 million is due to actual value being created. Of course, that wealth isn’t going everywhere. While all households have gotten richer on average, the top 0.1% of the population is attracting a greater proportion of overall wealth in the US, now near 14%. The ethics of this aside, it’s clear that the households that have more wealth now have more choices—about when to retire, where to live, what lifestyle to adopt and so on. In a way, it seems like Europeans have too little choice and Americans have so much that retirement investing can be tough for individual investors to navigate without either taking undue risks or locking themselves into weak returns. This is where CEFs come in, with their focus on assets from well-established companies. Plus their high yields almost act like a “mini-pension,” boosting your income without leaving you at the whim of the government. This is the way I viewed CEFs in my late 20s, when I began using their high dividends to get the income I needed to make the choices I wanted. I still view them this way. And in addition to their big dividends, these funds often chalk up strong returns, too, thanks in large part to their discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). As these discounts—which only apply to CEFs, by the way—shrink, they put upward pressure on the fund’s price. And the best part is that CEFs are easy to buy, trading on public markets just like stocks. Consider the first CEF we’re looking at today, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX). It’s one of the oldest funds in the world, tracing its history back to the 19th century (and is a current CEF Insider holding, too). This one is about as blue chip as it gets, with stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) among its top holdings. What’s more—and this is the key part—ADX trades at an 8.3% discount to NAV as I write this, and that discount is in the sweet spot, cheaper than it was a few months ago but carrying momentum as it steams toward par. ADX has been paying dividends since before the Great Depression, and its 8.3% dividend yield is fully covered by the 13.3% total NAV return (or the return on its underlying portfolio) it’s enjoyed over the last decade. Moreover, ADX has delivered a 5,340% return to its shareholders, with dividends reinvested, since the late 1980s, when US household wealth just started to meaningfully tick higher. That kind of performance—coming our way at a discount and with an 8.3% dividend—is exactly what we want from our “mini-pension,” and ADX delivers. But, as I said, we do have choices here. And ADX isn’t the only US-stock-focused CEF that delivers a large income stream and has withstood the test of time. Another is the General American Investors Company (GAM), which was launched in 1927 and yielded an impressive 9.4% to investors in 2024. GAM also holds large caps, with Alphabet (GOOGL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and Apple (AAPL) among its top holdings. And, like ADX, this fund’s market price–based return has been strong over the last decade—though not quite as strong as ADX—with a 14.4% annualized return. Moreover, GAM’s 9.3% discount sounds like a good deal, but that’s near its smallest-ever level, so we’re not rushing out to buy the fund today. But it is worth watching, and gets tempting when that discount drops to double digits. But the larger point remains: With high-yielding CEFs like these, we can start generating a meaningful income stream we can choose to use however we like.

Back in my 20s, when I was studying to get my PhD in Europe, I was told I had to pay into the national pension fund, and I would get that money back when I qualified for it. At that time, I qualified at 62, which seemed absurd—nearly 40 years for me (a severely underpaid academic!) to get back money I desperately needed today. But as it turns out, I was lucky. Europe’s mandatory retirement age is rising. Denmark, which currently has the oldest retirement age in Europe at 67, is raising that to 70. Germany, where a normal retirement age is currently 66, is discussing raising that to 73. Whether you like the life of a worker or not, I’m almost certain that you like having the ability to choose that life without having to worry about governments changing the rules on you mid-game. This lack of choice pushed me away from Europe in my 20s and led me back to America. Here’s what I found when I returned. This chart shows that the average American household has gone from $200k in savings in the 1980s to $1.2 million now—and, no, that isn’t due to inflation. That $200k in savings would be $535k in 2025 dollars, so more than half of the jump to $1.2 million is due to actual value being created. Of course, that wealth isn’t going everywhere. While all households have gotten richer on average, the top 0.1% of the population is attracting a greater proportion of overall wealth in the US, now near 14%. The ethics of this aside, it’s clear that the households that have more wealth now have more choices—about when to retire, where to live, what lifestyle to adopt and so on. In a way, it seems like Europeans have too little choice and Americans have so much that retirement investing can be tough for individual investors to navigate without either taking undue risks or locking themselves into weak returns. This is where CEFs come in, with their focus on assets from well-established companies. Plus their high yields almost act like a “mini-pension,” boosting your income without leaving you at the whim of the government. This is the way I viewed CEFs in my late 20s, when I began using their high dividends to get the income I needed to make the choices I wanted. I still view them this way. And in addition to their big dividends, these funds often chalk up strong returns, too, thanks in large part to their discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). As these discounts—which only apply to CEFs, by the way—shrink, they put upward pressure on the fund’s price. And the best part is that CEFs are easy to buy, trading on public markets just like stocks. Consider the first CEF we’re looking at today, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX). It’s one of the oldest funds in the world, tracing its history back to the 19th century (and is a current CEF Insider holding, too). This one is about as blue chip as it gets, with stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) among its top holdings. What’s more—and this is the key part—ADX trades at an 8.3% discount to NAV as I write this, and that discount is in the sweet spot, cheaper than it was a few months ago but carrying momentum as it steams toward par. ADX has been paying dividends since before the Great Depression, and its 8.3% dividend yield is fully covered by the 13.3% total NAV return (or the return on its underlying portfolio) it’s enjoyed over the last decade. Moreover, ADX has delivered a 5,340% return to its shareholders, with dividends reinvested, since the late 1980s, when US household wealth just started to meaningfully tick higher. That kind of performance—coming our way at a discount and with an 8.3% dividend—is exactly what we want from our “mini-pension,” and ADX delivers. But, as I said, we do have choices here. And ADX isn’t the only US-stock-focused CEF that delivers a large income stream and has withstood the test of time. Another is the General American Investors Company (GAM), which was launched in 1927 and yielded an impressive 9.4% to investors in 2024. GAM also holds large caps, with Alphabet (GOOGL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and Apple (AAPL) among its top holdings. And, like ADX, this fund’s market price–based return has been strong over the last decade—though not quite as strong as ADX—with a 14.4% annualized return. Moreover, GAM’s 9.3% discount sounds like a good deal, but that’s near its smallest-ever level, so we’re not rushing out to buy the fund today. But it is worth watching, and gets tempting when that discount drops to double digits. But the larger point remains: With high-yielding CEFs like these, we can start generating a meaningful income stream we can choose to use however we like.
