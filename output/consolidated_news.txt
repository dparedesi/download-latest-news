Title: Disney’s Biggest Disasters of 2024: From 'The Acolyte' to 'Mufasa' to ABC News

The Walt Disney Company saw its fair share of disasters in 2024, even as Hollywood’s biggest studio continued to wield enormous power across media and politics. Disney repeatedly attacked now-President-elect Donald Trump throughout the campaign cycle, resulting in a bad year for ABC News. The studio saw its biggest streaming show of the year flop with subscribers, yet another ominous sign for the Disney+ service. And Disney closed out the year with a major box-office bomb. For CEO Bob Iger, 2024 was something of a transition period as the company continued in recovery mode following two financially difficult years. Iger swung the ax yet again across multiple Disney properties, with layoffs at Pixar, ABC News, NatGeo, and more. Last year, Iger laid off 7,000 workers worldwide, or three percent of its workforce, as the company’s financials tanked. Disney can take solace in the success of its blockbuster sequels — Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine were the two top-grossing movies of the year. But for every Moana 2 that rakes in a fortune, Disney also lays a giant egg, further sullying the studio’s formerly sterling reputation. Here are Disney’s biggest disasters for 2024. The Acolyte With a budget that one estimate put at close to a quarter of a billion dollars, Disney’s latest Star Wars spin-off series aimed to be a streaming blockbuster that would help drive subscriptions. Instead, the series tanked with viewers and was canceled after just one season. Who’s to blame? Most critics pointed to its weak and pointless story, unengaging main actress Amandla Stenberg pointlessly playing two twins, and pointless virtue signaling (a coven of lesbian witches saying they are not welcome in the galaxy, the casting of a transgender actor in a supporting role, and showrunner Leslye Headland herself, who promoted the series as the “gayest Star Wars” ever). Disney+ Woes The Acolyte‘s failure is emblematic of the entire streaming service Disney+, whose original and exclusive content has not resulted in the market dominance Iger had hoped for. As the year drew to a close, headline after headline signaled trouble for the content platform. In September, Disney slashed prices for new subscribers to $1.99 a month, hoping to boost its Q4 numbers. This month, an ad industry expert reported that companies are pulling their dollars from Disney+ due to unimpressive subscriber numbers, and Disney was shut out on the streaming charts by Netflix, Amazon, Paramount+, and even Peacock. Mufasa: The Lion King In what was supposed to be a box-office slam dunk, this “live action” prequel to The Lion King opened to a hugely disappointing $35 million — way off from the already muted expectation of $50 million. The movie could still find its legs, but the opening was a catastrophe for Disney, which was hoping to turn The Lion King into its own movie franchise. ABC News The Disney-owned news network face-planted hard during the presidential campaign. First, debate anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis put their fingers on the scale in favor of Kamala Harris, resulting in a rigged match that was too obvious to ignore. Muir paid the price — his World News Tonight ratings tanked the week after the debate. Then, host George Stephanopoulos stepped in it when he defamed Trump on-air, resulting in a more than $15 million settlement. The Bob Iger wing of the Trump presidential library is going to look grand. Looking Ahead As 2025 approaches, Disney is readying to launch one of its biggest titles: Snow White, starring Rachel Zegler, opens in less than three months. In February, Pixar will release its first-ever TV series, Win or Lose. Both projects have made major changes to appeal more to non-woke audiences. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

Title: Is Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT) the Best Kid-friendly Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) stands against the other kid-friendly stocks. Investors and analysts alike are concerned about where equities are headed in 2025. On December 23, Eric Beyrich, Sound Income Strategies co-chief investment officer appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis for equities in 2025. Beyrich shared his perspective on the market, emphasizing a possible rotation in 2025. He added that drug and mega-cap tech stocks have previously led the market, but as their growth rates continue to decline, a rotation is probable. He also emphasized that value names, especially those that have underperformed over the past two years, are expected to make a comeback. Adding to this, Beyrich suggested that these value names have comparable relative growth rates and their valuation multiples, more often than not, are a third of that of the market. READ MORE: 10 Stocks That Will Make You Rich In 2025 and 12 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In Now. Speaking of the S&P 500, excluding Big Tech, the market has underperformed, and with the growth rate for the big seven declining, the market emphasis will more likely gear towards value names. Beyrich also added that as rates come down, housing inflation is also expected to decline. He suggested that "abject extremes" are going to help value stocks, especially because the S&P 500 has been trading at 25 times its forward earnings. He emphasized that people have been investing in these stocks because they are scarce, and with growth rates declining, the market will shift away from more expensive names. On the flip side, Beyrich acknowledged that some of the names are great companies with huge cash flows, but they do have a pricing issue. Beyrich also shed light on the nature of valuations, suggesting that they behave like pendulums, going extremes in both directions. Overall, he remains extremely bullish on cheap companies, especially those with solid catalysts for improvement. Stocks with a sustainable and long-standing business model are often deemed safer and have been a household name for adults as well as kids. Our Methodology To come up with the 10 best kid-friendly stocks to buy right now, we went over multiple similar rankings on the internet. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A person wearing headphones listening to an audio streaming service. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98 Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT), an audio streaming company, has grown significantly over the past few years. It allows people to discover music, listen to podcasts, stay on top of celebrity tours, and optimize listening profiles. The app is present in 184 countries and has more than 640 million monthly active users, comprising 252 million premium subscribers. The company grew its monthly active users by 11% year-over-year and revenue by 19% year-over-year to reach EUR 4 billion in the third quarter of 2024. 2024 marked one of the biggest Spotify Wrapped events yet, attracting more users to the audio streaming application. To improve and provide premium customer satisfaction, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) is making significant investments in AI. On December 4, the company announced that it made improvements to its AI DJ and AI Playlist, with a new addition; Spotify Wrapped AI Podcast. With these advancements, users can enjoy a more personalized streaming experience, positioning it as a customer favorite. In the third quarter of 2024, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) expanded its AI Playlist in beta to six markets, launched comments for podcasts, and expanded music availability to 85 new markets. Artisan Partners' Artisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Among our top Q3 contributors were Argenx, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) and Exact Sciences. Spotify is a leading global audio streaming franchise with over 600 million monthly active users. We believe its position in the supply chain is solid given a secular trend of fragmentation in the music industry as well as internal product and pricing initiatives. Shares rallied after the company reported strong earnings results, including 20% revenue growth. Importantly, the company’s profit margin is expanding nicely, and we believe it can rise further due to likely price increases, potentially better terms with labels and further cost discipline.” Overall SPOT ranks 3rd on our list of the best kid-friendly stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of SPOT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SPOT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Will AI Cause Mass Deflation?

December 28, 2024 By Peter St. Onge Forbes Magazine warns AI will set off “The Great Deflation Bomb.” Will we be buying eggs for fractions of a penny, houses for a song? The impact of Artificial Intelligence on the economy is heating up as AI begins to seep from its original killer app of cheating on college essays and porn. According to layoff firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in the last year, AI has accounted for one in ten layoffs in the tech sector and one in 50 layoffs overall. Small potatoes compared to the panicked warnings of a few years ago. But as Ray Kurzweil says, 1% in an exponential process is halfway there. And AI’s economic impact is likely to be exponential — so small you can barely see it, then it blows up and takes over everything. The question of whether AI is a blessing or a curse very much depends on how hard it is to create new jobs. If it’s easy to create new jobs, AI isn’t a job crisis at all — it’s a ladder. Think Silicon Valley in the 90s, when the new jobs paid much better than whatever Palo Alto townies were doing before tech showed up. On the other hand, if it’s hard to create new jobs, think Detroit in the 1970’s. A hellscape. The old jobs are gone, nothing to replace them. Minimum wage at best, riots over universal basic income at worst. Still, setting aside the job dynamics, one thing we can be sure of is AI will radically reduce prices — deflation. This is because, across the board, AI replaces things that were more expensive — especially when you consider AI combined with robots. Contrast with the 1990’s internet, which reduced some prices — say, buying things from Amazon or downloading an mp3 or movie. But a lot of the benefit from the internet was quantitative — meaning stuff got better. It didn’t necessarily get cheaper. After all, the 1990s internet couldn’t run a factory. Or a chicken farm. It couldn’t drive you to work, deliver your supply chain, or produce historical documentaries with a one-sentence prompt. So, yes, we could conceivably get eggs for pennies. Now, there is one caveat. Because our Federal Reserve has a giant money printer, and they fear deflation more, apparently than they fear World War 3. Meaning that as soon as AI and robots start bringing down prices — which is a good thing — the Fed’s immune response will kick in, and they’ll do everything they can to print money. Potentially for years on end. Aside from what easy money does to the economy, that will make assets boom. So, eggs for pennies, houses for millions. Putting it together, if we did the jobs thing right, AI is a utopia, up there with the mechanization of agriculture — or fire itself — as one of the most amazing things to happen to humanity’s quality of life. We might expect a ten-fold plus increase in standard of living — roughly the difference between Switzerland and Botswana. But if we did the Detroit thing on jobs, making it hard to create jobs with regulation, licensing, and taxes, we become a continent-sized Detroit of former middle-managers warming their hands in steel drums made of rusted-out windmill turbines. A tiny AI-enabled elite at the top. A huge underclass below. Clamoring, no doubt, for Universal Basic Income. AI’s impact will take a while, and the first decade might look closer to the internet — qualitatively better but similar prices. But when it hits in full, I think we’re looking at something akin to the industrial revolution. Source: Money Metals Exchange Peter St. Onge writes articles about Economics and Freedom.

Title: Small/mid-caps top long-term returns in 2024

In CY24, they have not been let down by any of them. All delivered positive returns in the calendar year, with equities topping the list. As far as the long-term performance is concerned, small- and mid-cap stocks top the chart in 2024 and outperformed the other asset classes. The accompanying chart exhibits the relative long-term performance of the most liquid financial asset classes accessible to Indian investors. We considered large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, gold, silver, US equities, Chinese equities, long-term debt and short-term debt and, computed the five-year returns at the end of each year for the last ten years. The assets were picked based on investment options available for Indian investors via direct investing or mutual funds/ETFs. Overall, when looking at long-term performance, mid-caps outperformed large-caps and small-caps in terms of consistency and relatively better returns. In the last five-year timeframe ended 2024, the Nifty Smallcap 250 Total Return Index (TRI), which represents small-cap stocks, produced a compound annualised return of 30.6 per cent, while the mid-caps as represented by Nifty Midcap 150 TRI, delivered a return of 28.3 per cent. The domestic equities market demonstrated stellar show after the pandemic, despite short-term turbulences. Trivesh D, COO Tradejini says, “However, this stellar performance may not carry forward into 2025. Market dynamics indicate that growth across segments is likely to moderate, with mid-single-digit returns being a realistic projection. Large caps may continue to provide stability but face valuation pressures, while mid and small caps could witness uneven performance due to slower earnings growth and heightened regulatory scrutiny”. Over the last 15 years, mid-caps have consistently outperformed large-caps and small-caps in the majority of timeframes, as the table illustrates. Over the last two years, US equities delivered better returns compared to the large-cap stocks in the domestic market. This growth has been largely driven by the ‘Magnificent 7 ’ — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — backed by strong earnings and major investments in artificial intelligence (AI). Further rupee depreciation has boosted 5 year returns for an Indian investor. For example, while the last 5-year CAGR of S&P 500 total returns (including dividends) is 15 per cent in USD terms, it increases to 19 per cent in INR terms. “In 2024, the US market has become much more balanced,” said Pratik Oswal, head of passive funds at Motilal Oswal AMC. The 450-490 companies that had not performed well last year have also recovered in 2024 and demonstrated better returns, he added. Macroeconomic factors such as the US Federal Reserve’s policy rate cut rate and the likelihood of more in the offing, and the easing of the rate of inflation have been favourable factors, leading to a resurgence in US stocks, Oswal said. After three years of underperformance, Chinese stocks came into the limelight thanks to the stimulus measures announced by the Chinese government in October 2024. The policy measure announced were aimed at supporting a weak property sector, increase retail consumption and boost capital markets. A China-focussed ETF trading in India returned 29 per cent this year, although 5-year CAGR was flat. The years 2018–2022 were not so good for the domestic fixed income markets, due to multiple headwinds. However, things changed over the last 18-20 months due to few factors including significant FII (foreign institutional investors) inflows into Indian government bonds and expectations of a rate cut cycle. Devang Shah, Head Fixed Income, Axis Mutual Fund, said, “For 2025, we believe the RBI will cut rates, driving performance of bond markets. We expect a 50-basis points rate cut in the next six months. The reasons for this would be slower GDP growth, as seen in the lower Q2 GDP, with Q3 and Q4 also expected to be lower. This would prompt the RBI to change its course and start cutting rates”. Your asset allocation plan should include debt funds since they may act as a buffer when other asset classes decline. Gold, as an asset class, is used as a store of value and a hedge against stock market volatility amid economic uncertainties. Despite short-term blips, gold prices have been on the rise since October 2022. The yellow metal has delivered a solid CAGR of 14.4 per cent over the last five years in rupee terms. Expected rate cuts by major economies and persisting geopolitical tensions led to a significant surge in gold price. Chirag Mehta, CIO, Quantum AMC said, “The surge in gold prices is anticipated to persist into 2025, with the trajectory expected to be influenced significantly by the return of President Donald Trump to office, which could herald a series of policy changes and strategic decisions.” Expected rate cuts by major economies and persisting geopolitical tensions could also lead to a significant surge in gold price he added. While the gold has been the mainstay of investors’ portfolio for years for diversification into commodities, the silver has also gained traction among investors. Silver is a key component in solar panels and other renewable energy technologies. The increasing demand for these technologies has driven up the demand for silver. Manish Banthia, CIO Fixed Income, ICICI Prudential AMC said, “The outlook for silver in 2025 is shaped by two key factors: its relationship with gold as a proxy in the precious metals space and its industrial demand dynamics”. The year 2025 presents a challenging macroeconomic environment in the United States, characterized by elevated debt levels and a substantial fiscal deficit. Gold, traditionally seen as a hedge against risk, is likely to benefit from these uncertainties, and this positive sentiment could extend to silver, given its dual role as a precious and industrial metal Banthia added. Secondly, the ongoing surge in power sector investments and electric vehicles (EVs) investments continues because of new age applications demand for silver may remain robust. Should these trends persist, silver’s industrial value will likely remain strong Banthia explained. Silver, in rupee term, delivered a CAGR return of 13.7 per cent in the last five years. However, gold outperformed silver over long run in most time frames, as the table illustrates. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: Real-World Asset Tokenization: Promise, Challenges, and the Path Forward
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/real-world-asset-tokenization-promise-challenges-and-the-path-forward/
Time Published: 2024-12-28T16:20:59Z
Full Content:
As Bitcoin reaches record highs, the concept of tokenization—creating digital representations of real-world assets on blockchains—is once again capturing attention in financial and cryptocurrency circles. Long touted as a transformative technology, tokenization has seen both promises of revolutionizing traditional asset markets and periods of slow progress. However, recent developments indicate a resurgence of interest, particularly among major financial players. According to a report by by Olga Kharif and Yizhu Wang for Bloomberg, despite years of growing discussion, tokenization’s adoption has been limited. According to data tracker rwa.xyz, only 0.003% of global assets are tokenized. Most participants in this space—about 67,530 entities—are institutions. Asset categories beyond stablecoins, such as tokenized securities, have struggled to gain traction, and many companies involved in these projects face financial difficulties. Regulatory hurdles in the U.S. have been a significant barrier. Historically, regulators have treated tokenized assets with the same caution as cryptocurrencies, leading many financial institutions to focus on other technologies, such as artificial intelligence. However, as reported by Bloomberg, the anticipated regulatory shift under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration—expected to take a more crypto-friendly approach—is providing new momentum. The involvement of major players like BlackRock, Visa, and Mastercard is also encouraging broader adoption. This year has seen notable advancements in tokenization. BlackRock launched a tokenized money-market fund, a milestone mentioned in Bloomberg’s report that has encouraged other institutions to accelerate their tokenization efforts. Visa introduced a platform allowing banks to issue fiat-based tokens, and Mastercard integrated its token network with JPMorgan’s Kinexys blockchain platform, facilitating cross-border transactions for businesses. Tether also debuted a tokenization platform, expanding its footprint beyond stablecoins. These developments indicate that tokenization is moving beyond experimentation toward practical implementation. For example, JPMorgan’s Kinexys already processes about $2 billion in daily transactions, showcasing the scalability of blockchain-based financial solutions, per Bloomberg’s report. Boston Consulting Group estimates that tokenized fund assets under management could grow from $2 billion today to over $600 billion by 2030. Bloomberg’s coverage also emphasizes the benefits of tokenization, including enhanced liquidity by enabling fractional ownership, making assets accessible to a broader range of investors. By leveraging blockchain, tokenized assets can reduce transaction costs and settlement times. Furthermore, the programmability of blockchain tokens allows for automated processes, such as escrow arrangements, that mitigate counterparty risk. Despite its potential, tokenization faces criticism. Industry experts warn against over-tokenizing assets that may not benefit from digitization. Poorly priced or illiquid tokenized assets could expose unsophisticated investors to significant losses. While the regulatory landscape is improving, unclear rules continue to pose challenges. Bloomberg highlights concerns that some asset classes, such as real estate or public securities, may not derive meaningful advantages from tokenization. For instance, owning a tokenized fraction of a Picasso painting lacks the tangible benefits of enjoying the artwork.

Title: What US buyers (and investors) can expect from the auto industry in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This year was a mixed bag for the large automakers, with sales in the US climbing and prices holding steady for the most part. But changes are coming for the industry — whether on the domestic front with a new administration or the threat of cheaper, foreign competition. S&P Global Mobility projects US sales will hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 16.2 million units in 2025, an estimated increase of 1.2% from a projected 16.0 million units in 2024, which S&P says still reflects an uncertain environment for auto sales in the US. "Vehicle pricing levels are expected to decline but remain high; interest rates are expected to shift further downwards, but inflation levels are anticipated to remain sticky, and new vehicle inventory should also progress, but careful management is expected too,” said Chris Hopson, manager of North American light vehicle sales forecasting for S&P Global Mobility, in its 2025 report. With that said, let’s take a look at what to expect from major automakers in the US next year, starting with the big three. Click here for Yahoo Finance's Tesla 2024 year in review and 2025 look ahead. The biggest of the Big Three experienced a strong 2024 with robust sales of its generally higher-priced vehicles, like trucks, SUVs, and EVs. GM (GM) shareholders were rewarded with the stock up 25% for the year, buoyed by GM’s aggressive accelerated share repurchase (ASR) programs, a type of buyback. GM announced a $6 billion ASR in June of this year, following a $10 billion ASR in November of 2023. After a Q3 in which GM said it took market share, the rest of the year was set up for success. GM said its inventory stood at around 627,000 vehicles entering Q4, which is around 50 to 60 days of supply entering a typically busy holiday period, and incentives in Q3 were 4.5% of average transaction price, which the automaker said was 2% below the industry. New EVs are coming in 2025, with the Cadillac Vistiq, Optiq, Escalade IQ, and Chevrolet Bolt EV. This comes after the company refreshed the Chevy Equinox and Traverse, GMC Acadia and Terrain, and Buick Enclave. But GM might have some issues with its EVs if the tax credit goes away under the Trump administration. “If those EV models, specifically for GM, because they made some launches that are doing fairly well in the past three months — if they're not eligible for tax credits next year, it is going to impact their ability to scale and ultimately our growth assumption,” S&P Global autos sector lead Nishit Madlani told Yahoo Finance. Despite a strong year, the company had some late-year surprises, like a $5 billion write-down in China and a wind-down of its Cruise robotaxi business. Investors will be keeping an eye on those two stories as 2025 progresses. GM’s archrival, Ford, is coming off a good sales year too. But all has not been well for the Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker. The company had to scale back its profit outlook for 2024 due to supplier issues and is still losing billions of dollars in its EV business. The company canceled an upcoming three-row EV SUV and pushed back the opening of a new EV plant, opting to focus instead on smaller EVs for the future, such as a compact-style pickup it says is coming next decade. With the cash cow F-150 pickup and Expedition full-size vehicles updated in 2024, Ford’s 2025 will consist of updates to the Mustang and Ford Transit commercial van along with the release of the $300,000 Mustang GTD supercar. The company has seen sales jump for its hybrid offerings like the Maverick pickup, F-150 hybrid PowerBoost models, and Escape CUV, and will continue to shift production toward those units. Wall Street is looking for better execution from Ford as well as cost discipline. “There are indications that the profit story for them is not trending in the direction we had expected a year ago, when we raised them to investment rate,” Madlani said. “They had some warranty costs. They had some supplier stability issues that we haven't seen at other automakers. So that's why there's some questions internally around execution from the management team there as well.” Ford will give a full update on its EV business outlook and profitability in the first half of 2025. The situation isn’t much better at Stellantis, which has Dodge, Ram, Jeep, Chrysler, Fiat, and others in its portfolio. A management shake-up will bring a new CEO in 2025 and a revamped plan for its automobiles and trucks. The delayed EV push for the automaker will see changes as well, with gas-powered cars joining the ranks of EVs, which will share the same platform. This comes after sales slumped for the automaker, with inventory building up and dealers having to slash elevated prices to move vehicles off the lots. “We’re grinding through a transition,” CFO Doug Ostermann said following the release of disappointing Q3 sales. For 2025 the company has promised lower prices for its existing models, like Jeep SUVs, with the addition of engine choices like V6s and V8s for customers who did not want to see those powertrain choices go away. And new models are on the way too. In terms of new product launches, the all-electric Dodge Charger Daytona is coming with a gas-powered version as well, an all-electric Jeep Wagoneer S is on the roster, and the Ram 1500 Ramcharger range-extended hybrid pickup will be pushed forward to 2025, jumping ahead of the all-electric Ram REV EV pickup. It should be noted that the Ram trucks were supposed to arrive in 2024. While S&P’s Madlani notes Stellantis has seen some improvement in terms of inventory management, there are deeper issues to work through, such as its mismanagment of production and demand in the first place. S&P ratings has a negative outlook on Stellantis at the moment. The world’s largest automaker — and the Big Three's biggest competitor — is having a banner year in the US, with year-to-date sales through Q3 up 5.5% and its “electrified vehicle” sales up a whopping 58% year to date. Powering those electrified sales are its Camry hybrids, RAV4 hybrid crossover, and even the new Tacoma that comes in mild hybrid form. And, of course, the Prius — the hybrid king that came to US shores 20 years ago is still setting the pace for hybrid sales. This year, Toyota went all out in the US with an all-new Camry and Tacoma pickup, two of its major volume sellers. It also relaunched the Landcruiser SUV and brought out minor updates to the Corolla, Sienna, and Crown, to name a few. Coming in 2025 is the new 4Runner, a midsize go-anywhere SUV with a devoted following that will be coming with — you guessed it — a hybrid powertrain. Toyota says hybrids are what Americans want, and pickup and SUV offerings like the Tacoma and 4Runner will cater to that demand. One note of caution for Toyota is the coming merger of Honda and Nissan. While the situation won’t likely change much in the near term (with the deal looking to close in 2026), it will allow the two Japanese automakers to match Toyota in size. “There is potential for a merged company to be better prepared to address the competitive threat from the newer players, as well as to be more competitive with Toyota,” S&P Global Mobility analyst Stephanie Brinley said in a note published earlier this month. Germany’s Volkswagen (VWAGY), once the crown jewel of the country’s automotive sector and formerly the world’s No. 1 automaker, had a rough year. The company’s slump in important regions like Europe (with threats of a major labor strike averted for the time being) and China is a major problem, and development difficulties with its in-house software and EV development have led to costly delays. The situation in China, once a top region for the company, isn’t going to get better anytime soon, even with a new joint venture partner coming. However, the US region has actually improved, with sales growing for the Atlas SUV, Tiguan crossover, and even Jetta sedan. Meanwhile, the company’s sole EV offering — the ID.4 — has seen sales cut by half in Q3, and the ID.Buzz van just went on sale, with a costly starting price of about $60,000. Another concern: There are no hybrids on offer at the moment in the US, a big miss considering their popularity. VW says the upcoming all-new Tiguan in 2025 won’t have hybrid power until 2026 at the latest, which is a concern as it is VW’s top seller in the US. The full-size Atlas won’t get hybrid power until 2026, either. VW’s big bet on electrification remains with EVs at the moment, which could be a tough sell. With most of its current models updated or refreshed last year or this fall with the 2025 model year, VW does not at the moment have anything big planned for next year. In fact, VW’s biggest new push in the US is with Scout Motors, its wholly owned startup that will make EV and hybrid versions of SUV and pickup adventure vehicles using Rivian tech. But those vehicles won’t be in showrooms until 2027 at the earliest, which means VW will have to power through with its current portfolio through 2025 and beyond.

Title: bl.portfolio in 2024: Preferred prudence over popularity, rationalism over exuberance

It is no different for us at bl.portfolio. Here, we take this annual ritual very seriously as we are in the business of giving ideas for your hard-earned money. In the world of investing, no one can predict the markets with certainty but what we can do is prefer prudence over popularity and rationalism over exuberance. That has always been our credo and in the same spirit, we curated our product every week this year. Here is an honest report card of all we did 2024: Caution has been the watchword in our approach to and writings on the equity markets in 2024. On the back of the nearly 20 per cent rally in the markets in 2023, our equity outlook for 2024, published on January 7 , set the tone saying that while there was no case for pessimism, there was ample case for caution this year. Our stance emanated from the market valuation at the beginning of the year (23.8 times trailing) being above long-term averages as well as heightened optimism on earnings growth. In this firm belief, even as the markets raced to their all-time highs well into the year until end-September, we gave more hold/sell/book profit calls on stocks (44) as against buy/accumulate (31). Looking back, we stand vindicated, with the markets now 10 per cent below the September peak and India Inc faced with a consumption slowdown, a slow pick-up in private capex as well as a cooling off in earnings growth. In our assessment period for our stock calls (July 2023 to June 2024), we gave 117 calls across the primary (42) and secondary markets (75). About one-third of the sell /book profits/avoid calls have worked for us, prominent among them being the calls on telecom and IT players such as Vodafone Idea, Indus Towers, Tata Communications and Birlasoft. With Nifty IT up 23 per cent this year on the back of last year’s 22 per cent, book profit calls on stocks such as HCL Tech haven’t worked well. But we continue to remain watchful on IT stocks, as we believe the rally has been driven by valuation multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. Our book profits call on PSUs such as Power Grid and NHPC worked well too, but calls to take money out on IRFC, RVNL and Mazagon Dock, though backed by sound fundamental arguments, were given a bit early, in hindsight. These stocks have eventually seen corrections since the September market peak. Reiterating our cautious views on overvalued PSUs especially in the defence space, we highlighted the significant risks in holding on to these stocks, despite their growth potential. In our edition dated July 7 , we had noted why the stocks trading at obscene valuations would be unable to ‘avert a painful retreat when market cycle attacks with a vengeance.’ It was near-perfect timing given the significant fall in defence stocks since then. Our article on the underlying factors driving the PSU rally published on May 11, 2024, is one of the top-read articles this year from the bl.portfolio section on our website. That said, half of our well-researched ‘buys’ this year (six in 11 calls) have outperformed the bellwether and the broader markets. These include value-picks NCC, KNR Constructions and UTI AMC, international pick Alphabet as well as Godrej Agrovet and Motilal Oswal Financial Services. In-house expertise on international investing is our USP, but we do admit we have been very choosy this year due to our conservative stance. Apart from the call on Alphabet mentioned above, we recommended a partial book profit on Meta Platforms in February 2024. Investors would have made 5x returns from our earlier buy recommendation in our November 2022 edition in a 14-month timeframe on this stock. This year, we also consciously covered special situations such as buyback, open offers, buyouts etc. to give more actionable ideas to investors on their existing shareholdings. The call to tender the shares at ₹10,000 in the Bajaj Auto buyback citing the massive rally and the valuation expansion has worked well, with the shares now trading 11 per cent below. Ditto with the ‘subscribe’ recommendation to the Grasim Rights issue, which has paid off. On the other hand, we found that we did not see much success with ‘accumulate’ and ‘hold’ calls. Only six of our 20 ‘accumulate’ calls (Nippon AMC, Caplin Point Labs being examples) provided opportunities to accumulate on dips. We also found that the 15 ‘hold’ calls (expected to perform inline with the markets) didn’t work for us. But it is better to err on the side of caution. On the fixed income side, at the beginning of the year , we were very clear that while rate cuts may or may not happen in India in 2024, interest rates have peaked and that investors should make the best of the rates available. We found both the short-end and the long-end of the yield curve attractive and recommended bonds/mutual funds at these ends. Fast forward to end-2024 and 10-year G-Sec yields have dropped to 6.79 per cent from 7.21 per cent a year ago and a similar pattern can be seen across maturities. Investors have thus benefitted from a rally in bond prices this year. Keeping in tune with our cautious stance on equities as well as the expectation of a peaking out of interest rates, we carefully showcased options in categories such as balanced advantage, equity savings, multi-asset, ultra short-term as well as gilt/long-duration funds in our weekly ‘Fund Call’ space in the mutual fund section. For the risk-averse investors, we also recommended safer FD options across tenures from banks and NBFCs whenever attractive options came up. If you bet on gold as a diversifier this year, you would not be disappointed. Post gold’s decent 13 per cent upside in 2023 to end at $2,063 an ounce, we had predicted it to touch $2,200 this year (technical analysis) in our annual outlook published on January 14. We further followed it up with a more bullish case for gold in our article ‘Goldilocks moment for gold’, published on March 17 , as it neared $2,200 in early March. At that point, expectations of US Fed rate cut amidst some uncertainty on whether inflation battle was actually won or not, geopolitical turmoil in West Asia, Russia-Ukraine war and high government debt and fiscal deficit levels in developed countries, made the case for gold too good to ignore. Gold went on to hit a high of $2,790 in October this year. Although it has cooled off marginally from those levels, investors who had taken a cue from our writing would have been solidly rewarded. Rupee depreciation, too, has added to gains for investors in gold in India, offsetting some of the impact of customs duty cut in the July Budget. While we have been receiving your feedback regularly through mail or social media, 2024 has been a landmark year for brand bl.portfolio in terms of making an on-ground connection with readers/investors. Towards this, the first of the ‘bl.portfolio Investor Conclave’ was held in Coimbatore in June with a presentation followed by a panel discussion with various experts on the topic of retirement planning. This event was extremely well-received and enabled us to understand the mindset of our audience. There is a plan to do more such events especially in tier-2 cities in the coming year. With bl.portfolio being entirely behind paywall on our website, online subscribers are a lifeline. To reach out to them, we initiated subscriber-exclusive webinars this year. We have so far done one on US investing and another on the market outlook for 2025 is being planned soon. Our in-house technical analysis has a great following and to add value to these readers, we commenced our YouTube Shorts video series for the ‘Today’s Pick’ column (BL Today’s Pick: Stocks to Buy or Sell) this year. Our Nifty Prediction Weekly Video series, which has a big fan base, crossed a milestone of 100 episodes in March this year with 139 having been completed so far. This year, we also experimented with guest stories written by readers based on their personal investing experience. SEBI’s report on F&O trading put out in late September gave us this opportunity. Reader response to our call was overwhelming and at the same time, heart wrenching as well. We carried a few stories with their permission to help the larger investor community take away important lessons. As the New Year dawns, bl.portfolio will see new leadership at the helm. I step down after what has perhaps been the best four-and-a-half years both for the product as well as for me, professionally. The structural changes and demands that the pandemic brought about has seen team bl.portfolio grow from strength to strength in this period and am glad that I have been able to do my bit. The show will go on and if you are looking for best parking places for your money, fresh and unbiased perspectives await you in 2025 too, at bl.portfolio.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Marine Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC) stands against the other best marine shipping stocks to buy according to analysts. Marine shipping is a critical component of the global economy, responsible for transporting approximately 80% of the world’s trade by volume. This industry serves as the backbone of international commerce by facilitating the movement of raw materials, manufactured goods, and energy resources across continents. The maritime shipping industry continues to face significant challenges as geopolitical tensions and security threats escalate in key shipping routes. Shipping companies have been forced to reconsider their routes, with many opting to divert vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, significantly increasing fuel costs and delivery times. These disruptions have far-reaching economic consequences, affecting supply chains and global trade. In an interview with CNBC on November 27, Adrian Beciri, CEO of Ducat Maritime said that marine shipping has faced a series of setbacks over the years, including the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, hyperinflation, manpower shortages, and the aftermath of conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East, including the blockage of the Suez Canal. These events have compounded the issues within the marine shipping sector and continue to affect the industry. Beciri highlighted the intrinsic difficulties of the shipping sector, particularly the demanding nature of the work, coupled with economic challenges that have contributed to a labor shortage in the shipping industry, a problem that is often overlooked by the broader market. The CEO also expressed concerns about the potential impact of the president-elect’s announcement of new tariffs on several countries, which could further complicate supply chains and necessitate a shift towards regional or zonal trading blocks. Such a shift could disrupt the historical patterns of international trade, which are based on the comparative advantages of large nations and the principles of free trade. Looking ahead, Beciri emphasized the importance of stable and consistent markets and policies to foster long-term investments and adjustments within the industry. He called for a conducive environment that would allow firms to make significant investments. Despite the mounting challenges faced by the maritime shipping industry, it remains an indispensable pillar of global trade. A tanker filled with petroleum products, sailing through a calm sea. To compile our list of the 10 best marine shipping stocks to buy according to analysts, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find marine shipping companies with a market cap of over $500 million as of December 24. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 10 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. We also included the number of hedge fund holders for these companies, which was sourced from Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential, as of December 24. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Upside Potential: 56.57% Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22 Stock Price as of December 24: $11.88 Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC) specializes in the transportation of petroleum products and chemicals. The company operates a modern and efficient fleet of MR (Medium Range) and chemical tankers, which serves major oil companies and global trading houses. Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC) has made significant investments in efficiency-enhancing technologies and scrubber installations, which have boosted chartering performance and reduced emissions. Looking forward, Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC) plans to invest approximately $30 million to $35 million in 2025, covering routine dry dockings and additional high-return performance upgrades, including specialized tank coatings. These investments align with upcoming regulations such as the EU Maritime Fuel Regulation. Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE:ASC) is focusing on a disciplined approach to cost management and deleveraging. The company has successfully reduced its cash breakeven level to the lowest in its history from $16,500 per day to $11,500 per day in Q3, which helped that company to achieve annualized savings of about $50 million. The company remains committed to reinvesting in its fleet while ensuring sustainable value creation. This includes evaluating potential avenues for reinvestment in the existing fleet and the broader market. Ardmore Shipping Corporation’s (NYSE:ASC) MR and chemical tanker fleets are well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for long-haul ton-miles and allow the company to maximize TCE (Time Charter Equivalent) rates, due to ongoing geopolitical disruptions, particularly as refineries and petrochemical production capacity expand in the East, while closures in the West drive higher ton-miles. Overall, ASC ranks 7th on our list of best marine shipping stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of ASC to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ASC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Marine Shipping Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ship Lease, Inc. (NYSE:GSL) stands against the other best marine shipping stocks to buy according to analysts. Marine shipping is a critical component of the global economy, responsible for transporting approximately 80% of the world’s trade by volume. This industry serves as the backbone of international commerce by facilitating the movement of raw materials, manufactured goods, and energy resources across continents. The maritime shipping industry continues to face significant challenges as geopolitical tensions and security threats escalate in key shipping routes. Shipping companies have been forced to reconsider their routes, with many opting to divert vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, significantly increasing fuel costs and delivery times. These disruptions have far-reaching economic consequences, affecting supply chains and global trade. In an interview with CNBC on November 27, Adrian Beciri, CEO of Ducat Maritime said that marine shipping has faced a series of setbacks over the years, including the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, hyperinflation, manpower shortages, and the aftermath of conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East, including the blockage of the Suez Canal. These events have compounded the issues within the marine shipping sector and continue to affect the industry. Beciri highlighted the intrinsic difficulties of the shipping sector, particularly the demanding nature of the work, coupled with economic challenges that have contributed to a labor shortage in the shipping industry, a problem that is often overlooked by the broader market. The CEO also expressed concerns about the potential impact of the president-elect’s announcement of new tariffs on several countries, which could further complicate supply chains and necessitate a shift towards regional or zonal trading blocks. Such a shift could disrupt the historical patterns of international trade, which are based on the comparative advantages of large nations and the principles of free trade. Looking ahead, Beciri emphasized the importance of stable and consistent markets and policies to foster long-term investments and adjustments within the industry. He called for a conducive environment that would allow firms to make significant investments. Despite the mounting challenges faced by the maritime shipping industry, it remains an indispensable pillar of global trade.

Title: Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB): One of the Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy According to Hedge Funds

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) stands against the other undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy according to hedge funds. A dividend aristocrat is an S&P 500 company that not only maintains regular dividend payments to shareholders but also increases its payouts annually. To qualify as a dividend aristocrat, a company must raise its dividends consistently for at least 25 consecutive years. Michael Clarfeld, Portfolio Manager at ClearBridge, recently talked about why companies that consistently grow their dividends are well-positioned to handle the challenges of 2025. With rising costs, tighter margins, higher interest rates, and inflation on the horizon, Clarfeld is still optimistic about the economy. He pointed to strong employment numbers, upbeat consumer sentiment, and confident businesses, especially after the election. Pro-business policies under the Trump administration could drive investments and growth, which sounds great, but there’s a catch. For instance, bringing manufacturing back to the US would create jobs and boost wages, but it could also increase business costs. After two strong years, Clarfeld doesn’t see much room for big capital gains in 2025. Plus, with inflation sticking around, the Federal Reserve is likely to take a more cautious approach. That said, he sees opportunities in sectors like European and global consumer staples and US energy infrastructure. Clarfeld is a big fan of dividend growth stocks, calling them a timeless investment. They can act as a safety net during volatile markets and provide steady income, which is especially useful when capital appreciation feels out of reach. He also highlighted how dividends help protect your purchasing power by keeping up with inflation. In his view, dividend growth is a smart and reliable strategy for navigating a potentially bumpy 2025. Paul Baiocchi of SS&C ALPS Advisors sees dividend investing as a smart move, expecting the Fed to ease rates. According to Baiocchi, investors are shifting from money markets and fixed income to dividend-paying stocks, especially companies with leverage that could benefit from lower interest rates. Similarly, Mike Akins of ETF Action also sees dividend ETFs as a defensive play, highlighting that the companies included typically have strong balance sheets. He notes the growing popularity of dividend-focused ETFs, suggesting that consistent dividends give investors confidence in a company’s stability and financial health. Both experts agree that dividends offer a sense of durability and drawdown protection in uncertain markets.

In this article, we selected stocks from the Dividend Aristocrats List that had a P/E ratio below 20 as of December 23. Our focus was on identifying stocks with the strongest hedge fund sentiment in Q3 2024 among the 66 Dividend Aristocrats that also met our P/E criteria. The stocks are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders for each company. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Dividend Yield as of December 23: ​​3.72% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45 P/E Ratio: 17.01 Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB), founded in 1872 and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, manufactures and markets personal care and consumer tissue products. The company operates through three segments – Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, and K-C Professional. Consumer demand for premium products continues to grow across developed and emerging markets, supported by trends like aging populations driving adult care. This positions KMB as one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks to buy. Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)’s gross margins have consistently improved over the past eight quarters, averaging 37% for the year. The company remains confident in achieving its long-term goal of at least 40% gross margin and operating margins between 18-20% by the end of the decade. Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) reported third-quarter sales of $5.0 billion, which was 4% lower than the same period last year. This drop was mainly due to a 3% hit from unfavorable currency exchange rates and a 1% impact from selling off their PPE business in July. Looking ahead, Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) anticipates stronger Q4 performance, with stepped-up investments in advertising and brand support. The company expects top-line growth to improve, driven by a volume mix-led strategy while navigating one-time and external factors. Despite these challenges, Kimberly-Clark is making steady progress on margins and remains committed to long-term growth. So far this year, Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) generated $2.4 billion in cash from operations, up from $2.3 billion last year, mainly due to improved operating performance. The company returned $2.0 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Total debt was reduced to $7.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, from $8.0 billion at the end of 2023. Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)’s board of directors announced a quarterly dividend of $1.22 per share, payable on January 3, 2025, to shareholders on record as of December 6, 2024. This marks the company's 90th consecutive year of paying dividends and the 52nd straight year of increasing them. Insider Monkey’s Q3 data shows that 45 hedge funds were bullish on Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB), compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 1.28 million shares worth $182.35 million. Overall, KMB ranks 4th on our list of the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of KMB to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KMB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin Set To Hit $350,000 Despite BlackRock Sell-Off Fears, Robert Kiyosaki Says
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-to-hit-350000-despite-blackrock-fears/
Time Published: 2024-12-28T15:00:42Z
Full Content:
Author of “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” and Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast Robert Kiyosaki has backed the premier cryptocurrency to attain a $350,000 price mark in 2025. This daring prediction comes alongside slamming comments against asset manager BlackRock whom Kiyosaki accuses of trying to manipulate BTC’s price. In an X post on December 27, Kiyosaki claimed that BlackRock under the leadership of Larry Fink, is currently offloading large amounts of Bitcoin as he voiced his distrust over the asset manager’s involvement in the BTC market. The American author reiterated the views of republican Vivek Ramaswamy, who described Larry Fink as a shareholder capitalist i.e. people who are focused on maximizing returns for shareholders rather than stakeholder capitalists who consider the interest of employees and communities. In this regard, Kiyosaki further alleges that BlackRock is deliberately suppressing Bitcoin’s price below $100,000 via sell-off to allow market whales to purchase at lower prices. Truly, data from Arkham Intelligence shows that BlackRock has recently moved +$203 million BTC to Coinbase Prime over the past two days. However, it remains to be seen if BlackRock intends to sell these assets or just maintain ownership on a custodial wallet. Furthermore, Robert Kiyosaki advises against investing in BTC via BlackRock’s ETF, preaching a mode of direct investment in place. Ironically, BlackRock boasts of the largest Bitcoin Spot ETF i.e. IBIT with $52.71 billion in net assets. Amidst rumors of a planned BlackRock market offload and BTC’s ongoing price decline, IBIT recorded its largest market outflow ever of $188 million on December 26 according to data from SoSoValue. Nevertheless, Robert Kiyosaki backs Bitcoin’s robust bullish structure despite BlackRock’s alleged price manipulation antics. The author affirms his conviction to purchase more BTC which he predicts will reach $350,000 per unit in 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $94,405 reflecting a loss of 1.88% in the past day. However, its daily trading volume is up by 12.95% and is valued at $51.35 billion. According to its daily chart, Bitcoin’s immediate resistance lies at $100,000, overcoming which can propel a return to the $108,000 price region marking a total price recovery for the premier cryptocurrency. Albeit, another rejection at $100,000 will force BTC to retain its current consolidation pattern. Regardless, Bitcoin continues to rank as the largest digital asset by market cap with total market shares of $1.86 trillion, translating into a crypto market dominance of 56.8%.

Title: Is Alight, Inc. (ALIT) Among the Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alight, Inc. (NYSE:ALIT) stands against the other best low priced stocks to invest in now. According to a report by Charles Schwab published on December 9, the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 from a position of relative strength, but the risks of volatility, particularly those related to policy, are significantly higher compared to the previous year. This uncertainty is largely driven by the policy proposals of President-elect Donald Trump, whose unconventional governing style and fluid policy positions have made forecasting their impact on domestic and global conditions extremely challenging. The report highlights that Trump's policy proposals, which include lower taxes and reduced regulations, are generally seen as growth-positive. However, these are offset by proposals for higher tariffs on imported goods and mass deportations of illegal immigrants, which are generally considered stagflationary, at least in the short term. In terms of the stock market, the report suggests that while equities can perform well from the beginning to the end of the year, the volatility is likely to be higher in 2025 compared to 2024. The S&P 500 is currently above its 50 and 200-day moving averages, which historically has been a positive indicator for future performance. However, the report cautions that after a year with 57 record highs, the median gain in the following year has historically been around 5.8%, suggesting a potential for a step back in performance. The report also notes that the S&P 500's 5-year normalized P/E ratio is quite stretched, indicating a product of market enthusiasm but not necessarily a near-term risk. For small caps, the report notes that the Russell 2000 has struggled in the current bull market due to higher interest rates and weaker profit profiles. The report suggests that profitable small caps could perform well if economic growth holds and the Fed takes a gradual approach to rate cuts, but the index as a whole might continue to face challenges if earnings growth does not improve.

Corpina, Senior Managing Partner at Meridian Equity Partners, discussed his outlook for U.S. stocks in 2025. Corpina noted that the market is finishing the year strong, supported by a resilient economy and key events such as the election and rate cuts being out of the way. He believes that the market will continue to move higher in 2025, though it will take a few quarters for the new administration to implement new policies and procedures. Corpina also addressed investor expectations for strong double-digit earnings growth for S&P 500 companies, suggesting that while the bar is set high, it's important to manage expectations. He emphasized that the economy remains fragile, and companies are still adjusting to the new environment and administration. He advised a cautious approach, noting that there are many uncertainties that could impact the market in the coming year. On the U.S. financial sector, Corpina is optimistic. He anticipates a lot of M&A activity and IPOs in 2025, driven by a pro-business administration. While the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 with a foundation of relative strength, the landscape remains fraught with uncertainty.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms End Trading Week Defying Market Bloodbath. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) stands against the other stocks. A wave of selling gripped Wall Street this Friday, pushing major indices lower as investors shifted capital towards more attractive investment opportunities. Ten companies bucked an overall bearish market sentiment, booking significant gains during the last trading day of the week. Let's explore how they managed to buck the trend and what factors contributed to their remarkable performance amidst widespread market uncertainty. Oil derricks in the background with a few workers in the foreground, emphasizing the company’s oil and gas production activities. Shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY) rallied by 0.75 percent on Friday to close at $48.56 apiece as investor confidence was boosted by billionaire Warren Buffett’s recent hoard of the company’s stocks. Earlier this month, Buffett through his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, gobbled up nearly 9 million shares for more than $400 million to push Berkshire's stake to 28.2 percent in Occidental Petroleum. At present, Occidental is one of Berkshire’s largest holdings, having owned another $8.3 billion in preferred shares, earning an 8-percent dividend rate. In a recent letter to his shareholders, Buffett said: “Under Vicki Hollub’s leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both the country and its shareholders… Vicki truly knows how to separate oil from rock (fracking), which is a unique ability that is valuable to her shareholders and to her country.” Hollub is the company’s president and chief executive officer (CEO). Overall OXY ranks 7th on our list of the firms that ended the trading week defying market bloodbath. While we acknowledge the potential of OXY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than OXY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Here’s a look back at the year that was for the world’s largest crypto. The Securities and Exchange Commission had spent a decade saying "no" to top asset managers who wished to offer a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund—the once elusive Bitcoin ETF—to their clients in the United States. But the mood shifted when the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, applied to the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF of its own in June 2023. An ETF is an investment vehicle that allows its buyers to gain exposure to an asset without buying and storing the asset directly. Gold ETFs, for instance, have long been a thing, and provide investors the convenience of investing in gold without fussing about finding a place to safely keep physical bars or coins. But the SEC had been wary of allowing such a thing for Bitcoin, denying applications over and over again on the grounds that the crypto market could be easily manipulated. Industry analysts thought BlackRock jumping in and lending its weight would finally be the thing that pushed the regulator to give the green light. And it turns out it was. On January 10, the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs, with 10 trading the following day. The U.S. market at last had a way for mom and pop retail investors to put a little money into Bitcoin without bothering with cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and seed phrases. It was huge—and it had a bigger impact than even the most optimistic Bitcoin proponents imagined. Nobody—not even those whose job it is to analyze the niche market of ETFs—expected such a roaring start once the trading began. Money hit the funds fast. Investors previously locked out of the world of crypto investing could suddenly buy shares on stock exchanges that tracked the price of Bitcoin. The asset hit an all-time high just above $73,000 in March, CoinGecko data shows. But it wasn’t an easy ride. Many macroeconomic factors—not to mention government confiscations and large crypto movements—weighed on Bitcoin throughout the year. Despite hitting a new all-time high in March, the next few months were rocky for Bitcoin as geopolitical risks—particularly in the Middle East—led investors to shift away from risk assets. At one point, Bitcoin struggled to break higher than $60,000 due to increased tensions between Iran and Israel and missile strikes. The German government caused further selling pressure when it sold off hundreds of millions of dollars of confiscated Bitcoin in June. Then, in September, it finally happened: The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by 50 basis points, the central bank's first such reduction since aggressively raising rates in 2022. The central bank had hiked interest rates in a bid to tame post-pandemic inflation. Higher interest rates generally lead investors to take a "risk off" approach, retreat from stocks and other even riskier assets like crypto, and flee to the relative safety of the U.S. dollar. The September cut and a subsequent chop in November made the asset more appealing to investors again, leading to a price surge. The "risk on" trade was back, and it helped push crypto assets beyond just Bitcoin to all-highs. The following month, Bitcoin did what crypto hopefuls had been prophesying for years: the asset crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in its 15-year history in early December following the reelection of Donald Trump as U.S. president, with investors expecting a more relaxed regulatory environment for digital assets to come. A big reason for the surge in the price of Bitcoin was down to two things: institutions and politics. On November 5, Trump stunned onlookers by snapping up the Electoral College and the popular vote. The Republican candidate campaigned as a Bitcoin-friendly potential leader of America. “I’m laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet,” Trump said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville back in July, promising to make the country a “Bitcoin superpower” if elected. Analysts and industry watchers anticipated that a Trump victory would enhance the leading digital asset. Their predictions proved accurate; shortly after being announced as the U.S.’s next president, Bitcoin’s price soared. Less than one month after his victory, Bitcoin hit $103,679. Conditions, at least in theory, are favorable for the asset to continue rising as America now has the most pro-congress crypto in its history, including Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, who is pro-digital assets and holds significant amounts of Bitcoin. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who will be the next U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, has spoken about how Bitcoin should back the dollar, and National Security Adviser Michael Waltz has voted for pro-crypto bills. A number of other Republicans and Trump-backers are also in favor of pro-crypto policy. All eyes are now on whether a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a plan for the U.S. government to hold billions worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet for years to come, will be approved when Trump takes the reins in January. The approval of the spot ETFs opened the doors to traditional finance bigwigs like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley investing in cryptocurrency via the vehicles. In the words of MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, 2024 was “year zero of institutional adoption.” Speaking of Saylor, the Bitcoin preacher’s company aggressively snapped up Bitcoin in 2024—accelerating its buys towards the end of the year. The software firm’s stock soared to all-time highs, and its co-founder continued to beat the Bitcoin drum, speaking far and wide about how the cryptocurrency could save a company. The billionaire—whose company held 444,462 Bitcoins, valued at around $42 billion at the time of writing—even shared a Bitcoin adoption strategy with the Microsoft board of directors. The company decided not to buy Bitcoin—despite admitting it had mulled over the matter. However, other small companies like Japan’s MetaPlanet and U.S. public companies such as Semler Scientific and Cosmos Health bought the asset as an inflation hedge. But it was more than just ETFs and institutional adoption that helped put the spotlight on Bitcoin in 2024. The timing was such that one of the most anticipated events for Bitcoiners happened this year as well: the Bitcoin halving. The event, baked into Bitcoin’s code, happens every four years and is meant to keep Bitcoin's inflation rate in check. After every halving, the reward for successfully mining a Bitcoin block is cut in half, meaning less Bitcoin now enters the system. This will keep happening until the mining reward is phased out completely, and Bitcoin reaches its fixed supply of 21 million coins. But this halving was different than the ones before, as investors focused on it more than ever. Why? Again, timing. Increased adoption and the success of Bitcoin ETFs led more people to anticipate that the event would raise the asset’s value. After all, less supply and more demand should lead to higher prices. And despite the event being somewhat underwhelming, the coin, for the first time, did hit a new all-time high even before its halving in April. This halving also brought with it something else: a short-lived craze for a new technical advancement on the Bitcoin network: Runes. Casey Rodarmor, the man behind Ordinals inscriptions—launched last year—created a new standard for creating tokens on the blockchain called Runes. The Runes protocol launched on the same day as the Bitcoin halving and proved popular—for a while—with dog-themed meme coins gaining traction on the network and surging in value. However, some in the community were unhappy about what the Runes mania did to the biggest and oldest crypto network: transaction fees soared whenever there was a flurry of activity on the blockchain to mint the new tokens. Still, even if it was just an annoying craze in the eyes of some, the launch proved that Bitcoin had more use cases to offer than just hold and hope "number goes up."

We recently published an article titled Market Slump Drags Down Share Prices of These 15 Companies. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON) stands against the other stocks. Wall Street’s main indices ended this week’s trading on a bloodbath following an overall market selloff as investors shifted their capital into assets offering higher returns. This article will delve into the factors behind the downturn and explore why each company was particularly affected. To come up with Friday’s top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A group of people in a fitness class with connected fitness products in a studio or gym. Fitness technology company Peloton Interactive saw an 8.57-percent decline in its share price on Friday to finish at $9.39 apiece as investors resorted to profit-taking following Thursday’s gains. In addition, analysts blamed the overall market downturn as having weighed down on its shares, while investors remained in a wait-and-see mode after the company nearly swung to profitability in its recent earnings report, having narrowed its net loss by 99.44 percent. Earlier this year, Peloton earned an Altman Z-Score of -1.56, indicating that it is in Distress Zones and could face the probability of bankruptcy over the next two years. A score of 3 or more shows that the company is performing fairly well. Overall PTON ranks 5th on our list of the stocks that were recently dragged down by market slump. While we acknowledge the potential of PTON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PTON but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Kinross Gold (KGC) the Best Low Priced Stock to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) stands against the other best low priced stocks to invest in now. According to a report by Charles Schwab published on December 9, the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 from a position of relative strength, but the risks of volatility, particularly those related to policy, are significantly higher compared to the previous year. This uncertainty is largely driven by the policy proposals of President-elect Donald Trump, whose unconventional governing style and fluid policy positions have made forecasting their impact on domestic and global conditions extremely challenging. The report highlights that Trump's policy proposals, which include lower taxes and reduced regulations, are generally seen as growth-positive. However, these are offset by proposals for higher tariffs on imported goods and mass deportations of illegal immigrants, which are generally considered stagflationary, at least in the short term. In terms of the stock market, the report suggests that while equities can perform well from the beginning to the end of the year, the volatility is likely to be higher in 2025 compared to 2024. The S&P 500 is currently above its 50 and 200-day moving averages, which historically has been a positive indicator for future performance. However, the report cautions that after a year with 57 record highs, the median gain in the following year has historically been around 5.8%, suggesting a potential for a step back in performance. The report also notes that the S&P 500's 5-year normalized P/E ratio is quite stretched, indicating a product of market enthusiasm but not necessarily a near-term risk. For small caps, the report notes that the Russell 2000 has struggled in the current bull market due to higher interest rates and weaker profit profiles. The report suggests that profitable small caps could perform well if economic growth holds and the Fed takes a gradual approach to rate cuts, but the index as a whole might continue to face challenges if earnings growth does not improve.

Corpina, Senior Managing Partner at Meridian Equity Partners, discussed his outlook for U.S. stocks in 2025. Corpina noted that the market is finishing the year strong, supported by a resilient economy and key events such as the election and rate cuts being out of the way. He believes that the market will continue to move higher in 2025, though it will take a few quarters for the new administration to implement new policies and procedures. Corpina also addressed investor expectations for strong double-digit earnings growth for S&P 500 companies, suggesting that while the bar is set high, it's important to manage expectations. He emphasized that the economy remains fragile, and companies are still adjusting to the new environment and administration. He advised a cautious approach, noting that there are many uncertainties that could impact the market in the coming year. On the U.S. financial sector, Corpina is optimistic. He anticipates a lot of M&A activity and IPOs in 2025, driven by a pro-business administration. While the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 with a foundation of relative strength, the landscape remains fraught with uncertainty.

The company is also making progress on the Lobo-Marte project in Chile, which has the potential to become a long-life, low-cost asset with significant production capacity. This project stands out for its high heap leach grade and low strip ratio, with baseline studies currently underway to further evaluate its feasibility. Furthermore, the company has made meaningful progress in reducing debt, repaying $650 million of a $1 billion term loan in 2024. This initiative has significantly strengthened the balance sheet, lowering the net debt to EBITDA ratio from 1.7 times to 0.5 times by the end of Q3 2024.

This uncertainty is largely driven by the policy proposals of President-elect Donald Trump, whose unconventional governing style and fluid policy positions have made forecasting their impact on domestic and global conditions extremely challenging. The report highlights that Trump's policy proposals, which include lower taxes and reduced regulations, are generally seen as growth-positive. However, these are offset by proposals for higher tariffs on imported goods and mass deportations of illegal immigrants, which are generally considered stagflationary, at least in the short term. In terms of the stock market, the report suggests that while equities can perform well from the beginning to the end of the year, the volatility is likely to be higher in 2025 compared to 2024. The S&P 500 is currently above its 50 and 200-day moving averages, which historically has been a positive indicator for future performance. However, the report cautions that after a year with 57 record highs, the median gain in the following year has historically been around 5.8%, suggesting a potential for a step back in performance. The report also notes that the S&P 500's 5-year normalized P/E ratio is quite stretched, indicating a product of market enthusiasm but not necessarily a near-term risk. For small caps, the report notes that the Russell 2000 has struggled in the current bull market due to higher interest rates and weaker profit profiles. The report suggests that profitable small caps could perform well if economic growth holds and the Fed takes a gradual approach to rate cuts, but the index as a whole might continue to face challenges if earnings growth does not improve.

Corpina, Senior Managing Partner at Meridian Equity Partners, discussed his outlook for U.S. stocks in 2025. Corpina noted that the market is finishing the year strong, supported by a resilient economy and key events such as the election and rate cuts being out of the way. He believes that the market will continue to move higher in 2025, though it will take a few quarters for the new administration to implement new policies and procedures. Corpina also addressed investor expectations for strong double-digit earnings growth for S&P 500 companies, suggesting that while the bar is set high, it's important to manage expectations. He emphasized that the economy remains fragile, and companies are still adjusting to the new environment and administration. He advised a cautious approach, noting that there are many uncertainties that could impact the market in the coming year. On the U.S. financial sector, Corpina is optimistic. He anticipates a lot of M&A activity and IPOs in 2025, driven by a pro-business administration. While the U.S. economy and stock market are entering 2025 with a foundation of relative strength, the landscape remains fraught with uncertainty.

Title: 5 A.I. Trends to Watch in 2025: Agentic A.I., 3D Models, Synthetic Data and More

In the first eight months of 2024, Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) collectively recorded a staggering $125 billion in A.I.-related capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating costs, according to a September JPMorgan report. The cumulative CapEx of these four tech giants alone is expected to soar past the $200 billion mark for the entirety of 2024. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. A.I. startups, meanwhile, received unprecedented amounts of funding from investors eager to cash in on the technology’s lucrative potential. OpenAI is set to finish out 2024 as the most well-funded A.I. company, most recently valued at $157 billion. Its rival Anthropic is gearing up for new fundraising that cold value it at $40 billion. Flush with cash, leading A.I. companies are now tasked with the challenge of proving to investors—and the public—that their pricy bets on the new technology will pay off. From an ongoing pivot into “agentic A.I.” to emerging new scaling laws and wide-ranging explorations of A.I.’s myriad capabilities, here’s a look at what 2025 will bring to the world of A.I.: The buzzword refers to autonomous A.I. assistants able to complete tasks without human oversight. The potential of A.I. agents to enhance workplaces and everyday life quickly caught notice in Silicon Valley, with companies like Salesforce embracing agents as their next major product. Microsoft, too, has rolled out a slew of A.I. agents in recent months. In November, it unveiled several A.I. assistants customized for its Microsoft 365 suite, including an agent able to provide translation in nine different languages. OpenAI is also on the “agentic A.I.” train, with an upcoming model expected to be able to perform tasks like booking travel and writing code. A.I. agents are “the thing that will feel like the next giant breakthrough,” said Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, during a recent AMA on Reddit. The global market for A.I. agents is currently valued at more than $5 billion, according to the research firm MarketsandMarkets. By the end of the decade, this figure is expected to soar to $47 billion, driven in part by demand for agents amongst enterprise clients. One of the key components of A.I.’s success in recent years has been the mass amounts of data fed into A.I. models. But there’s only a finite amount of text, images and videos on the internet. To avoid a plateau in the technology’s development, A.I. companies are turning to alternative ways to train their models. One of the most promising solutions is test-time compute, where A.I. models improve by reasoning and taking longer to think about potential answers before responding—a theory most recently demonstrated by OpenAI’s o1 model. On an earnings call in November, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang described OpenAI’s new model as “one of the most exciting developments” in scaling and noted that “the longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces.” Huang isn’t alone in his optimism. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also pointed towards test-time compute as a new scaling law in November, while OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever earlier this month highlighted it as a progression of A.I.’s pre-training era. Another solution to A.I.’s data crisis is replacing traditional data with information generated by the technology itself. The market for synthetic data is expected to skyrocket to $2.1 billion by 2028, representing an over 450 percent hike from 2022, according to BCC Research. Altman hinted at the potential of synthetic data a year ago when discussing A.I.’s dwindling data supply, remarking in an interview that “as long as you can get over the synthetic data event horizon, where the model is smart enough to make good synthetic data, I think it should be all right.” OpenAI, alongside competitors like Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft and Google, have all reportedly begun using synthetic data in some way to train and fine-tune models. In October, the A.I. startup Writer unveiled a new A.I. model trained entirely by A.I.-generated data. The approach allowed the company to cut significant costs in developing the model, which totaled at a mere $700,000 in comparison to the millions doled out by other companies. OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, for example, cost more than $100 million to train. Until now, much of A.I.’s visual outputs have remained two-dimensional, something tech pioneers are looking to shift in the coming years. “Large world models” are an emerging form of A.I. that aims to build interactive three-dimensional scenes advancing the worlds of movies, games and simulators. One of the largest players in this space is World Labs, a new startup established by Stanford A.I. pioneer Fei-Fei Li that raised $230 million earlier this year. The venture is looking to build large world models with “spatial intelligence,” a form of intelligence that understands and interacts with the real world. To demonstrate this concept, Li has previously used the example of a cat reaching out to topple over a glass of milk and humans’ ability to predict the consequence of this event and therefore take action to prevent the glass from falling. At the beginning of December, Google DeepMind launched its own large world model in the form of Genie 2, which simulates virtual environments that will be used to train and evaluate A.I. agents. The area will likely be a key focus for the lab going forward, as evidenced by its recent hiring of Tim Brooks, a former OpenAI researcher overseeing its video generator Sora. In an X post welcoming Brooks to his team, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis noted his excitement at “working together to make the long-standing dream of a world simulator a reality.” Google has long had a seemingly untouchable dominance on the search market. But with the advent of A.I., a proliferation of A.I.-powered search engines is looking to shake the tech giant’s foothold. Not that Google hasn’t embraced the technology itself. In 2024, it rolled out AI Overviews, a feature that provides users with A.I.-generated summaries rather than links. CEO Sundar Pichai predicts the feature will attract more than 1 billion users monthly users and is already “increasing overall search usage and user satisfaction,” he told Wall Street analysts in October. But Google will have to contend with an increasingly crowded industry for search tools, as companies like OpenAI and Microsoft expand into the arena with the help of A.I. Meta is also reportedly preparing to launch its own A.I.-powered search engine, while the startup Perplexity AI has emerged as an especially formidable player. Recently valued at $9 billion, its A.I. search tools already process around 20 million queries on a daily basis, up from 2.5 million at the beginning of 2024.

Title: Forecast 2025 — Taking Out the Trash
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4286828/posts
Time Published: 2024-12-28T12:53:32Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/28/2024 4:53:32 AM PST by MtnClimber "A core reflex in these decades of postmodern insanity was constant rejection of things we thought we knew in favor of New, Improved Beliefs packaged from above.” — Matt Taibbi, Racket News. I would guess that you’re feeling as if anything might happen now. It’s hard to rule out even the possibility that we could all be vaporized before moving onto the next mundane chore of the day. The world order is dangerously in flux. America’s Woke-Jacobin “Joe Biden” regime was defeated in the 2024 election, but they were apparently just a front for the sinister entity we call the “blob” or the Deep State, which in recent years has consistently and garishly acted against our country’s interests. So, the blob abides, and it probably weaves schemes in the deep background of daily life even as a new government awaits. But if the Woke-Jacobin Biden-istas were tied-in with the so-called “globalist” enterprise centered around the EU bureaucracy, with assistance from the World Economic Forum’s network of zillionaires and bankers. . . well, that coalition looks rather broken now. It’s doing a hurt-dance. It’s on the run, a little bit. What is not broken for the moment — a tenuous moment — is the new Trump regime’s determination to correct the disorders of Western Civ, starting with the affairs of the USA, according to age-old reality-based norms of behavior and good-faith relations between the people and their government. Trust was broken and must be restored. The President-elect has assembled an extraordinary team of reformers, if they can get to their posts without subversion. And, of course, Mr. Trump himself has to evade further attempts to rub him out, to knock him off the game-board before he can take office, and then he must survive the months beyond his inauguration. So, you are correct to be nervous. Paradoxically, Mr. Trump has to initially manage the US government as if it deserves a sense of reassuring continuity, which, in many respects it does not deserve. So many institutions and relationships between them have been perverted and damaged. How do we pretend that the upper layers of management in any federal agency — the strata who really run things below the top “political” appointees — can continue in-place as if all that perversion never happened? The Department of Justice and the FBI are filled with lawyers and agents who abused their power egregiously and went to war against the American people. The agency’s work will just have to stop for a while. The nation can probably endure if investigations and prosecutions are suspended for sixty days while the personnel issues get sorted out — who goes and who stays. But what about the Defense Department and the CIA? The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma ph**kery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

It’s hard to rule out even the possibility that we could all be vaporized before moving onto the next mundane chore of the day. The world order is dangerously in flux. America’s Woke-Jacobin “Joe Biden” regime was defeated in the 2024 election, but they were apparently just a front for the sinister entity we call the “blob” or the Deep State, which in recent years has consistently and garishly acted against our country’s interests. So, the blob abides, and it probably weaves schemes in the deep background of daily life even as a new government awaits. But if the Woke-Jacobin Biden-istas were tied-in with the so-called “globalist” enterprise centered around the EU bureaucracy, with assistance from the World Economic Forum’s network of zillionaires and bankers. . . well, that coalition looks rather broken now. It’s doing a hurt-dance. It’s on the run, a little bit. What is not broken for the moment — a tenuous moment — is the new Trump regime’s determination to correct the disorders of Western Civ, starting with the affairs of the USA, according to age-old reality-based norms of behavior and good-faith relations between the people and their government. Trust was broken and must be restored. The President-elect has assembled an extraordinary team of reformers, if they can get to their posts without subversion. And, of course, Mr. Trump himself has to evade further attempts to rub him out, to knock him off the game-board before he can take office, and then he must survive the months beyond his inauguration. So, you are correct to be nervous. Paradoxically, Mr. Trump has to initially manage the US government as if it deserves a sense of reassuring continuity, which, in many respects it does not deserve. So many institutions and relationships between them have been perverted and damaged. How do we pretend that the upper layers of management in any federal agency — the strata who really run things below the top “political” appointees — can continue in-place as if all that perversion never happened? The Department of Justice and the FBI are filled with lawyers and agents who abused their power egregiously and went to war against the American people. The agency’s work will just have to stop for a while. The nation can probably endure if investigations and prosecutions are suspended for sixty days while the personnel issues get sorted out — who goes and who stays. But what about the Defense Department and the CIA? The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma ph**kery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

Trust was broken and must be restored. The President-elect has assembled an extraordinary team of reformers, if they can get to their posts without subversion. And, of course, Mr. Trump himself has to evade further attempts to rub him out, to knock him off the game-board before he can take office, and then he must survive the months beyond his inauguration. So, you are correct to be nervous. Paradoxically, Mr. Trump has to initially manage the US government as if it deserves a sense of reassuring continuity, which, in many respects it does not deserve. So many institutions and relationships between them have been perverted and damaged. How do we pretend that the upper layers of management in any federal agency — the strata who really run things below the top “political” appointees — can continue in-place as if all that perversion never happened? The Department of Justice and the FBI are filled with lawyers and agents who abused their power egregiously and went to war against the American people. The agency’s work will just have to stop for a while. The nation can probably endure if investigations and prosecutions are suspended for sixty days while the personnel issues get sorted out — who goes and who stays. But what about the Defense Department and the CIA? The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma ph**kery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately.

The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

So many institutions and relationships between them have been perverted and damaged. How do we pretend that the upper layers of management in any federal agency — the strata who really run things below the top “political” appointees — can continue in-place as if all that perversion never happened? The Department of Justice and the FBI are filled with lawyers and agents who abused their power egregiously and went to war against the American people. The agency’s work will just have to stop for a while. The nation can probably endure if investigations and prosecutions are suspended for sixty days while the personnel issues get sorted out — who goes and who stays. But what about the Defense Department and the CIA? The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma ph**kery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.)

US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma ph**kery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency.

Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it).Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and EconomyDoes the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. 7 posted on 12/28/2024 5:27:19 AM PST by AndyJackson [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Wow… long read but very well worth it. 8 posted on 12/28/2024 5:31:07 AM PST by DesertRhino (2016 Star Wars, 2020 The Empire Strikes Back, 2024...

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital.

(Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson OilFor now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support.

The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life.

It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained ForThe “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency.

Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung.

World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. 5 posted on 12/28/2024 5:09:14 AM PST by ClearCase_guy [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Whenever you go to Kunstler's site it is always good to check the "eyesore of the month" which highlights post modern architectural wonders of our universe.

Inside Job (Don Henley) I think we need to keep our eyes on demographics also. World fertility is decreasing. Many countries (Russia, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, etc.) are facing a serious problem. Young people work and produce (as well as consume) but old people just consume. If a society has a population bulge of old people and a paucity of young people, then that is a serious imbalance. Lots of consumption, not that much production. In America, one of the arguments for immigration is that we don’t have enough young people, so we need to welcome the Third World. I reject this. But, if we deport a lot of immigrants, and if we fail to reproduce, then we will have have to solve a demographic problem. Our young people are not marrying, not having children, and a large percentage have even given up on dating. This is going to be significant — but maybe not for 20 years. And, yes, fertility issues from the vaccine may also play a part in all of this. I think our society should plan ahead and find a way to exist with a much smaller population. It’s going to happen. It isn’t a surprise. With some planning, we might be able to ease into an advanced society with a population of 250 million or so. It might be a good thing. It's a system problem, not just a fix this and all will be well problem. You encourage waves of immigration to increase land occupancy, drive up costs of having a home, decrease wages and the fraction of wealth going to the class that provides intellectual or physical labor, and family formation and reproduction will decline. So you import more people. And on ig goes. A weekend vacation at the beach used to be within everyone's reach. Anyone could own a small boat or a set of skis and go off the the lake, or river or bay or mountains to get recreation. Now these are all expensive pursuits for the leisure class. One way to begin to address the problem is that you stop the feedback loop based on mass immigration that dispalces the people you want to reproduce. It has been going on all of my adult life. It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger.

It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war in Vietnam started under Johnson and extended by Nixon and peace with honor Kissinger. Wow… long read but very well worth it. Kunstler is pretty much right on. He has made one bad call in all of this. He jumped on the peak oil bandwagon just before fracking was invented, that ignoble practice developed by some good ol boy texas wildcatters who were watching their patrimony dry up and needed to find a way to keep raping the earth for black gold to sell to earth raping motorists who wanted to visit grandma for Xmas. From the 1963 Communist Goals... 22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to “eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms.” 23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. “Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art.” Balderdascious left wing drivel You last post was great and is why I keep coming back here. Thank you and God bless you and yours. If we deport millions and stop worker visas wages then go up, families sizes increase and the chaos level goes down. Right now with the way the USA is run it is utter chaos and counter family... Beautifully Expressed! Beautifully Expressed! I am surprised you are anti fracking. Weird. You seemed normal to me but now I don’t get you. Raping Gaia? Totally agree. Dealing with the immigration problem has to be the priority. And lower taxes through tariffs to fund the government. These things would make a huge difference. But I still say that fertility is a slow problem to fix. It takes decades to create a new generation of workers, and we are going to be playing catch up for awhile. “It began with the inflation under carter caused by the CIA war…” _______ Of course. Tariffs are taxes, sales taxes paid by the ultimate user of a tariffed product. The big benefit of tariffs is that smart corporations will re-shore industry to the US, manufacture stuff here, employ Americans, and avoid those tariffs. That’s better for everyone. Income taxes and such provide no such benefit. Not all taxes are created equal.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News That You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where iLearningEngines, Inc. (NASDAQ:AILE) stands against the other AI stocks. Bloomberg Intelligence projects that the generative AI market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42%, reaching $1.3 trillion by 2032, up from $40 billion in 2022. This growth is driven by demand for generative AI products, especially infrastructure for training large language models, digital ads, and specialized software. The market could generate an additional $280 billion in software revenue, with major companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia expected to benefit as enterprises increasingly move workloads to the cloud. By 2032, generative AI is predicted to account for 10% of total IT spending, with significant revenue coming from infrastructure services, AI servers, and software. The technology is also expected to have a transformative impact on life sciences and education.

Title: Billionaire David Tepper’s Long-Term Stock Pick: Why Microsoft (MSFT) Stands Out
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-david-tepper-long-term-123743807.html
Time Published: 2024-12-28T12:37:43Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire David Tepper's 10 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other long-term stock picks of Billionaire David Tepper. David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management is a multi-billion dollar hedge fund that was co-founded by billionaire Carolina Panthers owner Tepper in 1993. The fund was initially launched with a focus on distressed debt, which Tepper had years of experience in following a seven-year run as a credit analyst and head trader at Goldman Sachs. Appaloosa quickly built a name for itself on the backs of those distressed equities and Tepper’s aggressive investment style, returning 57% within its first six months of operation and has delivered impressive compound returns of greater than 25% since inception. It was managing $800 million in assets within five years of launching, which has since grown to $16.8 billion as of late 2023. That figure would be much greater if not for the fact that Tepper began transitioning his fund into a family office in 2019, beginning the process of returning money to outside investors. By 2022, nearly 90% of Appaloosa’s assets were owned by either Tepper, his family, or Appaloosa employees. Appaloosa’s 13F portfolio contained just 38 long positions heading into the final quarter of 2024, and was valued at $6.73 billion, up from $6.18 billion at the end of June. The fund added four new positions to its portfolio during Q3, while unloading three former holdings. Tech stocks held a dominant position in the fund’s portfolio for the third straight quarter, accounting for 38.5% of its value. The fund also had significant exposure to both communications and consumer discretionary stocks, at 24.6% and 23.1% respectively. Appaloosa’s exposure to various sectors was markedly different just five quarters earlier, when tech stocks accounted for just 7.1% of its 13F portfolio, while energy and utilities stocks came in at 15% and 21.7% respectively. The fund also had much greater exposure to healthcare stocks at that time, which accounted for 9.2% of its portfolio value, compared to just 2.4% at the end of September 2024. Of particular note is not just the sector allocations of Tepper’s fund, but also where those stocks originate from. Appaloosa’s top two stock picks are both Chinese stocks, as are 4 of its top 12 equity holdings. The fund has also built a stake in a major Chinese large-cap ETF. The bulk of those China-based additions to Appaloosa’s portfolio have come within the past five quarters, just ahead of major stimulus initiatives and economic policy shifts by the Chinese government that have helped spur in a rebound in the world’s second-largest economy. In a September interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Tepper noted that despite some recent gains in Chinese stocks, they are still trading significantly below past valuations and at just single-digit earnings multiples despite double-digit growth rates. He contrasted that to the S&P trading at a 20+x multiple to highlight the ongoing attractiveness of Chinese stocks. Tepper added that the Chinese government has exceeded expectations when it comes to its stimulus plans, which should bode very well for the Chinese economy in the months and years to come. Given Appaloosa’s highly concentrated portfolio and the relatively short timeframes with which it overhauls its holdings, there is notable value in focusing on those stocks that the fund has held on to for several years. The following data is gathered from Appaloosa Management’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). That’s why you should pay close attention to this important indicator. Note: All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ active funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2024 reporting period. Value of Appaloosa Management’s 13F Position (9/30/2024): $417 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (9/30/2024): 284 Ranking second on the list of Appaloosa’s top long-term holdings is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has had a place in the fund’s 13F portfolio since Q1 2020. The fund cut its stake in the tech giant by 18% during Q3 to 970,000 shares, with the stock ranking as its fourth-largest position overall. Hedge fund ownership of Microsoft was flat during Q3 and has dipped by 9% over the past year. Some investors are worried that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s lead in cloud services and generative AI is wilting, which has forced it to boost its genAI-related capital expenditures. While that could drag down free cash flow in the near term, the investments are expected to begin paying dividends in the second half of the company’s fiscal 2025, when new capabilities are rolled out for Azure. Barclays predicts Microsoft’s Azure growth will accelerate in the second-half of FY25 to between 31% and 32%, while UBS is even more bullish, projecting 34% year-over-year growth. Loop Capital predicts that Microsoft’s free cash flow will still grow at a strong CAGR of 18% through FY27 despite the capex constraints, before accelerating to as high as 40% growth in FY30. The firm has a $550 price target on Microsoft. RiverPark Large Growth Fund expects continued double-digit revenue and EPS growth for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) according to its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT): MSFT was a top detractor in the third quarter following a fiscal fourth quarter earnings report that featured inline operating metrics but mixed guidance. Positively, the company reported strong revenue (+15%) and earnings growth (+10%), powered by Azure (+30%), and operating margins of 43%. Guidance however calls for lower than expected fiscal first quarter Azure revenue as infrastructure constraints limit growth, and higher capital expenditures throughout the company’s fiscal 2025 to alleviate these constraints. The company expects growth to reaccelerate in the back half of fiscal 2025 as more AI capacity comes online. Overall, MSFT ranks 2nd among Billionaire David Tepper's 10 Long-Term Stock Picks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why the TikTok ban could collapse the creator economy

The TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans. This crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. 💰 Aly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes… but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one. Also: AI isn't the next big thing - here's what is Thousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem. This ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company.

BTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts. All that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. 😅 The TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. 😤 Here is the recap: Deadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension). Consequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned. Reason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government. TikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. 🙃 On December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban. Also: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning In response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban. As of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain. In addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. 😱 TikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. 😳 Meta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money. For advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks. Also: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead To understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible. There are two main stages of awareness: Intent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you… you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward. Discovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery. Discovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly. Stay with me; you need to understand this to see the void… ⏳ TikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there. Also: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today Since TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers. What's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers. Without TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. 🥺 The obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. 🏆 Google is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine. Yeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine. Amazon also stands to benefit. TikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful. Also: Drowning in spam?

However, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives.

One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions. All I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. 🤔 If you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you. The obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem. The real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators.

U.Today - Robert Kiyosaki, investor and financial expert, also known for authoring a best-selling book on finances “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has published a tweet about Bitcoin and the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) chief executive. He criticized the latter and said that he intends to keep buying Bitcoin, once again voicing his ultra-bullish price prediction of $350,000 for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Kiyosaki believes that “Black Rock suppressing Bitcoin price so the whales can buy Bitcoin at under $100k.” The “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author said that he loves Bitcoin in his wallet and would never entrust the BlackRock ETF with his BTC holdings. Still, Kiyosaki tweeted that he intends to continue stocking up on Bitcoin for one simple reason — it continues to rise in the current highly unstable economic environment: “I will keep buying more Bitcoin because Bitcoin going higher.” Back then, Kiyosaki wrote that the main reason for his prediction is the fact that the U.S. now has a pro-Bitcoin president who takes office in January. Trump accepted crypto donations during his election campaign and made several promises to the crypto community, which include the creation of the strategic Bitcoin reserve and the pardoning of the Silk Road founder Ulbricht Ross from his double life-sentence he has been serving in prison since 2013. A curious thing — before Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time this December, Kiyosaki tweeted that he would stop buying BTC once $100,000 was left behind since it is not the time “to get greedy” now. However, in today’s tweet, he said he would continue accumulating Bitcoin. Earlier this year, Kiyosaki predicted BTC to hit $500,000 in 2025 and then $1 million by 2030 based on AI data. He provided no details about that, though. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Big Tech’s H1B Arguments Aren’t Just FALSE… They’re Also Immoral.

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/27/2024 10:11:47 PM PST by SoConPubbie A fierce debate has broken out between President-elect Donald J. Trump’s very recent tech industry supporters and his long-standing America First base. At the core of the disagreement is the subject of legal immigration—specifically, how Trump should handle so-called “high-skilled” foreign worker programs like the H1B visa.One of the staunchest proponents of expanding the labor pool in this way is billionaire Elon Musk. In a Christmas Day post on X, Musk exclaimed America needs more than double the 160,000 semiconductor industry engineers said to be required by 2032.“No, we need more like double that number yesterday! The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,” Musk wrote, adding: “Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. That enables the whole TEAM to win.”No, we need more like double that number yesterday!The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low. Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 25, 2024Additionally, Musk-allies and newly-named artificial intelligence (AI) advisors to President-elect Trump, David Sacks, and Sriram Krishnan, have both emerged as loud advocates for more legal immigration, expanding the high-skilled labor supply through changes to the H1B visa lottery.A FLAWED MORALITY.While bringing allegedly top talent from around the world to the United States sounds good on its face, this isn’t actually what H1B visas do.The O-1 visa is actually the program used to grant legal work status to a foreign nation in the United States that is considered a ‘once-in-a-generation’ intellectual talent in a critical industrial sector.H1B visas apply more to workers with skills that native-born Americans can easily learn through technical training programs or even collegiate classes. Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

You get these “Libertarian”. tech bros who think they have the absolute right to replace any American employee if they can find someone anywhere in the world who can more or less do the job and works cheaper. And the the same Globalist mentality pervades the corporate class especially of the Anglo-Sphere. The backlash in Canada has been such that Liberal Justin Trudeau has announced big changes to the Temporary Foreign Workers Program, with tighter qualifications, higher mandatory wage premiums. Canada is now positioned to the Right of the USA on foreign workers, and Trump needs to get on this. 11 posted on 12/28/2024 12:39:44 AM PST by Reverend Wright ( Everything touched by progressives, dies !)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie I keep saying it. The solution to this is simple. Allow companies as many H1bs and other work visas for foreigners as they want. Simply charge them an amount of money per visa per year that guarantees it will be.....key words here......MORE EXPENSIVE to hire those foreigners than it would be to hire Americans for those jobs.Viola! That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas. Frankly....good. I won't mind seeing them take it in the shorts - and finally have to start participating in a truly free market - one bit. 15 posted on 12/28/2024 1:39:08 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: FLT-bird Interesting points.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

In a Christmas Day post on X, Musk exclaimed America needs more than double the 160,000 semiconductor industry engineers said to be required by 2032.“No, we need more like double that number yesterday! The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,” Musk wrote, adding: “Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. That enables the whole TEAM to win.”No, we need more like double that number yesterday!The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low. Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 25, 2024Additionally, Musk-allies and newly-named artificial intelligence (AI) advisors to President-elect Trump, David Sacks, and Sriram Krishnan, have both emerged as loud advocates for more legal immigration, expanding the high-skilled labor supply through changes to the H1B visa lottery.A FLAWED MORALITY.While bringing allegedly top talent from around the world to the United States sounds good on its face, this isn’t actually what H1B visas do.The O-1 visa is actually the program used to grant legal work status to a foreign nation in the United States that is considered a ‘once-in-a-generation’ intellectual talent in a critical industrial sector.H1B visas apply more to workers with skills that native-born Americans can easily learn through technical training programs or even collegiate classes. Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all.

Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating.

That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

Simply charge them an amount of money per visa per year that guarantees it will be.....key words here......MORE EXPENSIVE to hire those foreigners than it would be to hire Americans for those jobs.Viola! That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct.

It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas. Frankly....good. I won't mind seeing them take it in the shorts - and finally have to start participating in a truly free market - one bit. 15 posted on 12/28/2024 1:39:08 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: FLT-bird Interesting points.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The O-1 visa is actually the program used to grant legal work status to a foreign nation in the United States that is considered a ‘once-in-a-generation’ intellectual talent in a critical industrial sector.H1B visas apply more to workers with skills that native-born Americans can easily learn through technical training programs or even collegiate classes. Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

We have to break this cycle.

In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first.

The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles.

When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

Move ‘em on, head ‘em up, head ‘em up, move ‘em on Move ‘em on, head ‘em up, rawhide The whole H1B program is a disgrace. You get these “Libertarian”. tech bros who think they have the absolute right to replace any American employee if they can find someone anywhere in the world who can more or less do the job and works cheaper. And the the same Globalist mentality pervades the corporate class especially of the Anglo-Sphere. The backlash in Canada has been such that Liberal Justin Trudeau has announced big changes to the Temporary Foreign Workers Program, with tighter qualifications, higher mandatory wage premiums. Canada is now positioned to the Right of the USA on foreign workers, and Trump needs to get on this. The H1B program serves a need in the US. The problem is not the program. The problem is that Deep State has abused and is continuing to abuse the program. Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. Why did we have an H1B for a Chippendales "dancer"?That's not use. It's abuse.And the Deep State promoting the abuse is the problem. That's not use. It's abuse.And the Deep State promoting the abuse is the problem. And the Deep State promoting the abuse is the problem. Notice one more thing about this latest game of lets-you-and-him-fight tbat Deep State ginned up. What’s missing, folks? I’ll tell you since a lot if you clearly haven’t noticed... Any mention of Big Med. It’s not just Big Tech hiring H1Bs, is it. So why no mention of what Big Med is doing? That omission is telling to my mind. Stop allowing yourselves to be suckered into an either/or argument meant to divide us. We hired Trump to do a job. Give him room to do it. Viola! That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas. Frankly....good. I won't mind seeing them take it in the shorts - and finally have to start participating in a truly free market - one bit. You wanna know why?

Frankly....good. I won't mind seeing them take it in the shorts - and finally have to start participating in a truly free market - one bit. Interesting points. It’s kind of like putting a tariff on H1B workers so other countries don’t dump them here. Off-Topic: Is your tagline a reference to the movie “Signs”? I'm a contractor. I do projects for large banks. It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH!

They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market.

Title: House prices prompt growing number of young professionals to live in Newry while commuting to Dublin

Six Christmas trees are dotted around a magnificent Co Down house where a book club made up of mainly Dubliners has just met. Camembert Santas were served on charcuterie boards by Co Tipperary-born Pádraig Mullally and his husband Ruairí, who hosted the monthly event in their cinnamon-scented livingroom. The couple live in a detached new-build in the sprawling Hillcrest village development in Bessbrook, a former Quaker village on the outskirts of Newry. “It may as well be a suburb of Dublin,” laughs Ruairí. “There’s 24 of us in the club and only two are from Newry; I’m one of them. The majority are from the South. There’s a lot of Dubs and there’s a guy from Limerick and another one from Wexford. There’s even a woman from Donegal.” During the day, the estate is like “a ghost town” as so many residents are working in Dublin, he adds. Mullally (33) grew up on a farm in Drangan and studied science in Cork; he drives to Blanchardstown in Dublin three days a week where he works for a pharmaceutical company. While a future move back to Tipperary hasn’t been ruled out, he “wouldn’t even consider” relocating to Dublin to be closer to work. “Our quality of life would be massively changed. We were only down in Dublin at the weekend and it was so much more expensive. And then if you think of the house prices,” Mullally says. [ A personal housing plan: Move to Newry, buy for €150,000 less, commute to DublinOpens in new window ] “Take for example our house – a four-bedroom detached with super handy proximity to Belfast and Dublin. You wouldn’t get anything in Dublin for £265,000 (what they paid). It would be unheard of.” Mullally is among the growing number of young professionals living in the border city while continuing to commute to Dublin. Post-pandemic remote working, cheaper rents and a lower cost of living are among the reasons for the increasing number of Southern-based workers renting or buying in Newry, according to local estate agent Ian Hall. “Some of them might have a connection or are moving back here,” he adds. “They’re younger, educated, probably travelled more and their jobs offer more flexibility in terms of where they can live. A lot of them work in professional services or IT.” Hall’s firm, Hanna Hillen, handled many of the sales in the nearby Gantry Lane development, which began four years ago and is almost complete. Diggers are on site where, according to one builder, the remaining houses will “go like hot cakes” as it is so close to Newry train station. A new hourly Belfast to Dublin train service was introduced at the end of October. Estate agent Micheál Hastewell recently sold a three-bedroom semi in Gantry to a couple from the South. “The young couple told me that they were sick of being slaves to Dublin. They were happy to buy something at probably half the price of what they can afford in Dublin,” he says. “But there is now huge demand for Newry – and the supply just isn’t here. “Even more recently, we rented a property down the old Warrenpoint Road. Again, it was a couple renting a shoebox of an apartment in Dublin. They saw a three-bedroom house online for £950 per month. “They’re saying Southern prices are out of control.” Hillcrest resident – and book club member – Emma Morgan (35) is a Dublin-based accountant from Skerries who has been living in the North since 2019. “My husband is from Newry. I always joke that I moved up for love and cheaper housing,” she says. Morgan’s plan was to stay temporarily and save up to buy a house in Skerries – where the average price for a three-bed semi is in excess of €500,000. That has now changed. “We bought our home in Newry at the same time my brother bought a two-bedroom apartment in Skerries. With the exchange rate, it was roughly the same price. We got ours for £212,000 and then paid an extra £15,000 for the sunroom. Already, the value of property in this estate has increased significantly. I redid our mortgage in April and they valued it at £280,000.” But it is more than the cost of property that is keeping her in the North: “If we moved back, there would be a significant impact on our quality of life purely because our money is not going to go as far down South. [ Northern Ireland house sales reach highest point in two yearsOpens in new window ] “Also, from the day I moved up here, I had friends. We’re all pretty much blow-ins – and from all about the place as well. It’s not just Dublin. I think the fact we are blow-ins, we’re looking for that bit of community, so the likes of the book club is great for that. “Joe, my husband, says that I now know more people than he does. I’ve made such an effort over the last five to six years. I joined every baby group going when I had my son.” Before going on maternity leave – she is returning to work next month – Morgan commuted to the office by train two to three times a week. The station is a short drive away. “I would get the 7.40am and be in at ten past nine. I’d get the 4.50pm home and get in at just after six o’clock. Those were roughly the hours I would be in and out of the house when I lived in Skerries. “The internet on the train is generally good and I logged the extra hours when I was working on the train. My boss was completely happy with that because the work got done. “Pre-Covid we were based in Thomas Street, but we’re now out in Blackrock. I used to get the train to Connolly and walk; now I get the Dart and it’s much of a muchness.” A town before it was granted city status in 2002, Newry was an economic black spot during the 1980s with rocketing unemployment rates and a depressed property market. Today, housing demand is outstripping supply. The peace process had a transformative effect, but Southerners would “never have contemplated” buying houses in Newry during the Troubles, says Ian Hill, who has been an estate agent for more than 20 years. “My dad bought a petrol station in Newry in 1983 and had it until 1996. That was a time whenever petrol was cheaper in the North and people would have been coming from the South. They would have been coming down just for a day, and that was a big thing,” he recalls. “Peacetime brought stability, and then you see some things shared – like the health service, for example. All those things break down barriers and maybe make it more comfortable for people from the South to live here.” In early 2025, work will begin on a further housing development close to the main A1 motorway. Paddy Gray, emeritus professor of housing at Ulster University, is aware of the emerging trend: “I think Newry’s an attractive place to live and people regularly travel over the Border. The salaries are much higher in Dublin and it’s not a long commute. When you think of people going to their jobs in London and spending an hour-and-a-half on the Tube, and all the stress of that.” Gray sits on the Residential Tenancies Board, an independent body that regulates the private rental sector in Ireland. Earlier this month, the board released data showing rental costs increased by 4.7 per cent in the Republic in the three months to June compared with the same quarter last year. The average cost of a new tenancy in the South now stands at €1,644 a month. Dublin rentals are highest, costing an average of €2,147. “Remember, these are only averages and figures can be skewed and are much higher in some cases,” adds Gray. In the North, prices are also rising. Government figures show the average price for a house in Northern Ireland was £190,553 between July and September, a rise of 6.2 per cent on the same period last year. In the Newry, Mourne and Down area, it was £201,305 (the fourth highest of the North’s 11 local government district areas), representing a 4.2 per cent increase on the previous year. Back at the Mullallys’ home in Hillcrest, they were preparing to spend Christmas in Tipperary. “I think we could live there one day. We’re farmers in rural Tipp, there’s a bit of frontage there – that’s why Ruairí married me,” jokes Pádraig. “We see the likes of my brother building a fabulous house in the country and that has sparked something. “But we have a life in Newry and Ruairí obviously has his family here as well. I feel like I have the best of both worlds here.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

December 27, 2024 By Neenah Payne Donald Trump has been under attack by the corporate media, Big Tech, and the Democrats in a variety of ways since 2016 when he first won the Presidency. They called him a “threat to democracy” and tried to bar his return to power through four cases of lawfare. They even threatened to jail him before the Republican National Convention in July. Trump survived two assassination attempts. NYT: Liberals Bet They Could Beat Trump With the Law. They Lost. Trump won both the Electoral College and the popular vote. Republicans will control the House and Senate. Now, even as President-elect, Trump Is commanding respect at home and abroad. Trump was invited to = the re-opening of Notre Dame in Paris where he charmed First Lady Jill Biden so spectacularly that he used the photo on his social media site to promote his perfume “Fight”! Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada rushed to Mar-A-Lago, Trump’s Winter White House, when Trump threatened to put a 25% tariff on Canada if it doesn’t close its border to illegal aliens. Doocy: Trump is in a honeymoon period like we’ve never seen before shows that Big Tech titans and the corporate media are rushing to Mar-A-Lago to support and court President-elect Trump. Tech moguls Altman, Bezos and Zuckerberg donate to Trump’s inauguration fund shows that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos of Amazon (owner of The Washington Post), and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (parent company of Instagram and Facebook) are each contributing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has a meeting scheduled with Trump.

Republicans are calling for a criminal indictment of Liz Cheney who served as Vice Chair of the J6 Committee for reported witness tampering which is a felony. Trump 2.0 greets the press with a fight 12/18/24 What’s new is that he’s about to be president again, and he has multiple pending lawsuits against media organizations. The other big new factor is that ABC just settled for an astonishing $16 million – a $15 million donation and $1 million in attorneys fees. When I saw the ABC settlement, the first word that popped in my head was the word “emboldened.” Clearly, this settlement has emboldened Trump and his allies, and I think we see that in the Des Moines Register lawsuit that was filed on Monday. Humiliation for ABC News as it’s forced to pay Trump $15 million after Stephanopoulos lies THE ABC has been humiliated again after they were forced to settle a defamation case brought on by Trump following lies told by their star host George Stephanopoulos. The network will pay $15 million to a Presidential foundation and museum set up by Trump. Disney’s Settlement With Donald Trump: Bob Iger’s $16 Million Decision, Fear at ABC News and Questions About George Stephanopoulos’ Future ‘Furious’ George Stephanopoulos’ pay cut after $16 million Trump settlement ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos’ contract has been renewed by Disney despite having the $US16 million settlement. According to The New York Post, Disney decided to renew Stephanopoulos’ contract because they didn’t want “his blood on their hands”. The anchor was reportedly given a multi-year deal but was forced to take a pay cut from his $US20 million contract, according to sources. A longtime executive from ABC News spoke to The New York Post following Stephanopoulos’ renewal. “No one wants a talent mess on their hands. No one wants an angry George Stephanopoulos loose in the world. No one wants to humiliate George by firing him or to have his blood on their hands,” the source said. George Stephanopoulos Was Repeatedly Warned Not to Use the Word ‘Rape’… But Didn’t Listen 12/19/24 Megyn Kelly is joined by Victor Davis Hanson, author of “The End of Everything,” to discuss how George Stephanopoulos was repeatedly warned not to say the word “rape” but decided to anyway, how Joy Reid and MSNBC downplayed the mistake, and more. CNN Rating sink to all-time low in vital demographic for advertisers – as left-leaning networks plummet after Trump win 12/18/24 Ratings-challenged CNN plummeted to a new all-time low in the most coveted demographic for advertisers — a downfall exacerbated by viewers tuning out left-leaning networks following President-elect Donald Trump’s overwhelming election win. The cable news pioneer — which is in the midst of a major overhaul that will reportedly include mass layoffs — averaged 92,000 total day viewers in the key 25-to-54-year-old demo this year, a 1% drop from the previous rock bottom of 94,000 it notched last year, according to Nielsen data first reported by Mediaite. CNN suffered a 52% decline in its primetime demo since the election, pulling in a measly average audience of 77,000, according to Nielsen. Its overall primetime viewership shriveled by 45% this year to 405,000 viewers, the data showed. Just 11% of cable news viewers tuned in to CNN’s primetime shows after Trump’s election win — lagging behind left-leaning rival MSNBC’s 16%….Just 11% of cable news viewers tuned in to CNN’s primetime shows after Trump’s election win — lagging behind left-leaning rival MSNBC’s 16%. Meanwhile, conservative network Fox News drew a staggering 72% of all eyeballs in primetime, according to Nielsen…. Fox’s primetime viewership has grown 7% since the election compared with its October average, according to Nielsen data earlier cited by the Hollywood Reporter. The network also extended its reign as the No. 1 cable news channel in total viewers and the key 25-54 demographic for the ninth year in a row.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Encode, the nonprofit organization that co-sponsored California’s ill-fated SB 1047 AI safety legislation, has requested permission to file an amicus brief in support of Elon Musk’s injunction to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit company. In a proposed brief submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Friday afternoon, counsel for Encode said that OpenAI’s conversion to a for-profit would “undermine” the firm’s mission to “develop and deploy … transformative technology in a way that is safe and beneficial to the public.” “OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, claim to be developing society-transforming technology, and those claims should be taken seriously,” the brief read. “If the world truly is at the cusp of a new age of artificial general intelligence (AGI), then the public has a profound interest in having that technology controlled by a public charity legally bound to prioritize safety and the public benefit rather than an organization focused on generating financial returns for a few privileged investors.” OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. But as its experiments became increasingly capital-intensive, it created its current structure, taking on outside investments from VCs and companies, including Microsoft. Today, OpenAI has a hybrid structure: a for-profit side controlled by a nonprofit with a “capped profit” share for investors and employees. But in a blog post this morning, the company said it plans to begin transitioning its existing for-profit into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), with ordinary shares of stock and the OpenAI mission as its public benefit interest. OpenAI’s nonprofit will remain but will cede control in exchange for shares in the PBC. Musk, an early contributor to the original nonprofit entity, filed suit in November requesting an injunction to halt the proposed change, which has long been in the works. He accused OpenAI of abandoning its original philanthropic mission of making the fruits of its AI research available to all, and of depriving rivals of capital — including his AI startup, xAI — through anticompetitive means. OpenAI has called Musk’s complaints “baseless” and simply a case of sour grapes. Facebook’s parent company and AI rival, Meta, is also supporting efforts to block OpenAI’s conversion. In December, Meta sent a letter to California attorney general Rob Bonta, arguing that allowing the shift would have “seismic implications for Silicon Valley.” Lawyers for Encode said that OpenAI’s plans to transfer control of its operations to a PBC would “convert an organization bound by law to ensure the safety of advanced AI into one bound by law to ‘balance’ its consideration of any public benefit against ‘the pecuniary interests of [its] stockholders.’” Encode’s counsel notes in the brief, for example, that OpenAI’s nonprofit has committed to stop competing with any “value-aligned, safety-conscious project” that comes close to building AGI before it does, but that OpenAI as a for-profit would have less (if any) incentive to do so. The brief also points out that the nonprofit OpenAI’s board will no longer be able to cancel investors’ equity if needed for safety once the company’s restructuring is completed. OpenAI continues to experience an outflow of high-level talent due in part to concerns that the company is prioritizing commercial products at the expense of safety. One former employee, Miles Brundage, a longtime policy researcher who left OpenAI in October, said in a series of posts on X that he worries about OpenAI’s nonprofit becoming a “side thing” that gives license to the PBC to operate as a “normal company” without addressing potentially problematic areas. “OpenAI’s touted fiduciary duty to humanity would evaporate, as Delaware law is clear that the directors of a PBC owe no duty to the public at all,” Encode’s brief continued. “The public interest would be harmed by a safety-focused, mission-constrained nonprofit relinquishing control over something so transformative at any price to a for-profit enterprise with no enforceable commitment to safety.” Encode, founded in July 2020 by high school student Sneha Revanur, describes itself as a network of volunteers focused on ensuring voices of younger generations are heard in conversations about AI’s impacts. Encode has contributed to various pieces of AI state and federal legislation in addition to SB 1047, including the White House’s AI Bill of Rights and President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI.

Title: Google CEO Pichai struggled to navigate a pressure-filled year
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/google-ceo-pichai-struggled-navigate-pressure-filled-year-rcna185596
Time Published: 2024-12-27T21:28:57Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Google’s blowout earnings report in April, which sparked the biggest rally in Alphabet shares since 2015 and pushed its market cap past $2 trillion for the first time, tempered fear that the company was falling behind in artificial intelligence. As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google’s employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company’s workforce. “We’ve noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce,” one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. “How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company’s success?” The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. “Despite the company’s stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases” another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company’s vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday’s close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai’s vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai’s standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google’s grip on U.S. search. The company’s share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had “offended our users and shown bias,” according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. “We definitely messed up on the image generation,” Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. “It was mostly due to just not thorough testing.” The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google’s traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked “How many rocks should I eat each day,” the tool said, “According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day.” AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren’t hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview’s launch shouldn’t discourage them from taking risks. “We should act with urgency,” Reid said. “When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won’t always find everything and that just means that we respond.” Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ’s request represents the agency’s most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won’t have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company’s AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube’s combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple’s AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company’s cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company’s Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. “Google does not have one single visionary leader,” a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. “Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed.” In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan’s and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of “chief scientist,” but internally, he is now listed as an “IC,” or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai’s leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should’ve happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google’s scrappy roots. He’s flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google’s Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company’s hit AI products in 2024. After Brin’s hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google’s position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they’ve seen Brin walking around the company’s Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they’re pursuing. Despite Brin’s reemergence, several employees told CNBC they’re doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn’t strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it’s hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company’s AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco’s waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of “Wicked” actors, where one, labeled “execs” looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled “Gemini” while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as “users.” A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. “Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company’s future, and are proud to work here,” the spokesperson said. A few employees say they’re no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google’s CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more “cost efficiencies” across the company in order to invest more in AI. “I think any organization can always push a little further and I’ll be looking at additional opportunities,” Ashkenazi said. That month, Google posted a job listing for a “Central Reorg Support Team Partner.” The responsibilities of that fixed-term contract position would include consulting with local HR teams and noted the need for the support staff’s “ability to operate with empathy and diffuse/de-escalate challenging conversations/situations.” “Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do,” one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. “Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people,” another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down. Touting its AI technology to clients, Pichai’s leadership team has been aggressively pursuing federal government contracts, which has caused a heightened strain in some areas within the outspoken workforce since the beginning of the year. Google terminated more than 50 employees after a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon that provides the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Executives repeatedly said the contract didn’t violate any of the company’s “AI principles.” However, documents and reports show the company’s agreement allowed for giving Israel AI tools that included image categorization, object tracking, as well as provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. Earlier this month, a New York Times report found that four months prior to signing on to Nimbus, officials at the company worried that signing the deal would harm its reputation and that “Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations.” In an all-hands meeting in April, a highly rated question asked why employees who did not participate in the protests were also fired, which was reported and cited in a National Labor Relations Board complaint from affected employees. Chris Rackow, Google’s security chief, took the stage at the all-hands and rebutted those claims. “This was a very clear case of employees disrupting and occupying work spaces, and making other employees feel unsafe,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the company “carefully confirmed” that every person terminated was involved in the protests. “By any standard, their behavior was completely unacceptable.” That round of job eliminations underscored Google’s clampdown on internal discussions related to hot-button topics, including politics and geopolitical conflicts, which was encouraged by executives several years prior. One internal meme that got more than 2,000 likes, compared Google to Star Wars’ Anakin Skywalker. The meme shows an image of a smiling childhood Skywalker, framed by one of the company’s original, colorful employee badges. The meme progresses Skywalker’s age in two later versions of the badge. The final badge shows Darth Vader working for “Google,” spelled out in the font of IBM’s logo.

Title: Google CEO Pichai struggled to navigate a pressure-filled year

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Google’s blowout earnings report in April, which sparked the biggest rally in Alphabet shares since 2015 and pushed its market cap past $2 trillion for the first time, tempered fear that the company was falling behind in artificial intelligence. As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google’s employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company’s workforce. “We’ve noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce,” one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. “How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company’s success?” The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. “Despite the company’s stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases” another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company’s vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday’s close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai’s vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai’s standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google’s grip on U.S. search. The company’s share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had “offended our users and shown bias,” according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. “We definitely messed up on the image generation,” Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. “It was mostly due to just not thorough testing.” The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google’s traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked “How many rocks should I eat each day,” the tool said, “According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day.” AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren’t hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview’s launch shouldn’t discourage them from taking risks. “We should act with urgency,” Reid said. “When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won’t always find everything and that just means that we respond.” Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ’s request represents the agency’s most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won’t have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company’s AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube’s combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple’s AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company’s cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company’s Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. “Google does not have one single visionary leader,” a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. “Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed.” In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan’s and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of “chief scientist,” but internally, he is now listed as an “IC,” or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai’s leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should’ve happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google’s scrappy roots. He’s flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google’s Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company’s hit AI products in 2024. After Brin’s hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google’s position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they’ve seen Brin walking around the company’s Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they’re pursuing. Despite Brin’s reemergence, several employees told CNBC they’re doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn’t strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it’s hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company’s AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco’s waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of “Wicked” actors, where one, labeled “execs” looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled “Gemini” while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as “users.” A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. “Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company’s future, and are proud to work here,” the spokesperson said.

We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Wall Street is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. Defiance ETFs CEO and CIO Sylvia Jablonski said in a recent program on Bloomberg that there are trillions of dollars of cash waiting on the sidelines ready to be invested in AI amid demand that is at an all-time high. “There’s a biggest wealth transfer of our generation happening as we speak. And you know, Gen Z, you know, Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X kind of, you know, the younger traders are, this is where they’re allocating their funds to. And, you know, retail has definitely spoken, and institutions have definitely spoken, and they’re looking for that, that fourth industrial revolution allocation.” Sylvia also talked about the relationship between quantum computing and AI and explained how this technology would improve AI systems: “So chatbot AI is, you know, kind of version one. Quantum is taking everything to the next level. So you need quantum in order for it to be efficient. You need to process that data quickly. It will help, you know, essentially health care, cryptography, aerospace and defense, you know, blockchain technology. Anything you can think of will be better, too, with quantum supercomputing power.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we chose 10 AI stocks that are currently buzzing on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 160 Chris Grisanti, MAI Capital Management chief marketing strategist, made the case for Alphabet during a program on CNBC and said he believes the stock is undervalued. “I would urge investors to look through the antitrust stuff, which I would say will take at least half a decade to play out. Use this as an opportunity to crunch the numbers. It’s now selling at its lowest PE relative to the market of all time—about 80% of the market PE in an expensive market. This is the one MAG7 stock I really like. It can perform well if it hits its earnings numbers, it’s not overly expensive, and it offers a nice way to invest in that space even if you’re cautious about the other valuations.” Grisanti also reminded investors about Microsoft’s anti-trust issues back in the day and the stock performance: “I’d ask investors to take a deep breath. I am old enough to remember Microsoft in the late ’90s and their six-year battle with the antitrust authorities, where the government sought to break up the company. Microsoft lost the first round but eventually prevailed on appeal. During that time, the stock tripled.” The market has been ignoring Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s key secondary businesses and the stock remains undervalued despite concerns around AI search and regulatory onslaught. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s secondary ventures in AI, autonomous driving, and other areas are making solid progress, especially in the Waymo robotaxi segment. Currently, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock trades below 20 times forward earnings, offering potential upside as EPS and other financial metrics strengthen in coming years. For next year, the consensus EPS estimate sits around $9. However, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has consistently beaten projections, delivering $7.54 in trailing twelve-month EPS compared to the expected $6.79—a roughly 11% outperformance. With the 2025 EPS forecast at around $9, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could realistically achieve earnings closer to $10 if it maintains its historical outperformance rate. At a projected $10 EPS, Google’s forward P/E multiple would be approximately 17, a relatively low valuation for a diversified market leader. What are the key drivers for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)? Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains on track to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In its autonomous driving division, Waymo has shown notable progress, with paid autonomous rides growing 200% quarter-over-quarter to 150,000 weekly rides as of late October, thanks to a fleet of 700 vehicles in service since August. This growth is significant: Waymo vehicles now average about 30.6 autonomous rides per day—substantially higher than Uber’s average of 4.18 rides per driver daily, based on Uber’s 31 million daily trips and 7.4 million drivers last quarter. This performance underscores Waymo’s competitive edge in autonomous ride volume compared to traditional ride-hailing. In the third quarter, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Search & Other segment saw a 12.2% year-over-year revenue increase, rising from $44.03 billion to $49.39 billion. YouTube advertising also performed well, with revenue up 12.2% to $8.92 billion from $7.95 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue grew even more sharply, surging 27.8% from $8.34 billion to $10.66 billion. Google Cloud has been expanding steadily, with revenue climbing from $13.06 billion in 2020 to $33.09 billion in 2023. Notably, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in 2023, posting $1.72 billion in operating profit—a significant improvement from a $5.61 billion loss in 2020. This segment’s performance continues to strengthen, with the latest quarterly revenue reaching $11.35 billion, up 35% from $8.41 billion in the same period last year. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ie Google/YouTube, having returned 20.8% in the June quarter, gave a fair bit of that back by falling 8.8%. Its results seemed pretty positive, and appeared to beat expectations. Management claims its AI integration into its search business is working well, and the margin expansion from costs out is expected to continue. Market chatter suggests that the selloff stems from concerns about the high capital spending on servers and data center equipment. Alphabet has made it clear that this spending is necessary, and somewhat defensive as it can’t risk losing the AI war (a “build it, and they will come” approach). Also, the new Department of Justice case against it probably did not help matters. Nonetheless, we saw no need to adjust our estimates. We wrote last quarter that it traded at a premium to our valuation, but not so much as to warrant selling. With the share price falling and the premium reducing, our view is unchanged. It represents 4.4% of the Fund.” Overall, GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

During that time, the stock tripled.” The market has been ignoring Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s key secondary businesses and the stock remains undervalued despite concerns around AI search and regulatory onslaught. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s secondary ventures in AI, autonomous driving, and other areas are making solid progress, especially in the Waymo robotaxi segment. Currently, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock trades below 20 times forward earnings, offering potential upside as EPS and other financial metrics strengthen in coming years. For next year, the consensus EPS estimate sits around $9. However, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has consistently beaten projections, delivering $7.54 in trailing twelve-month EPS compared to the expected $6.79—a roughly 11% outperformance. With the 2025 EPS forecast at around $9, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could realistically achieve earnings closer to $10 if it maintains its historical outperformance rate. At a projected $10 EPS, Google’s forward P/E multiple would be approximately 17, a relatively low valuation for a diversified market leader. What are the key drivers for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)? Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains on track to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In its autonomous driving division, Waymo has shown notable progress, with paid autonomous rides growing 200% quarter-over-quarter to 150,000 weekly rides as of late October, thanks to a fleet of 700 vehicles in service since August. This growth is significant: Waymo vehicles now average about 30.6 autonomous rides per day—substantially higher than Uber’s average of 4.18 rides per driver daily, based on Uber’s 31 million daily trips and 7.4 million drivers last quarter. This performance underscores Waymo’s competitive edge in autonomous ride volume compared to traditional ride-hailing. In the third quarter, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Search & Other segment saw a 12.2% year-over-year revenue increase, rising from $44.03 billion to $49.39 billion. YouTube advertising also performed well, with revenue up 12.2% to $8.92 billion from $7.95 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue grew even more sharply, surging 27.8% from $8.34 billion to $10.66 billion. Google Cloud has been expanding steadily, with revenue climbing from $13.06 billion in 2020 to $33.09 billion in 2023. Notably, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in 2023, posting $1.72 billion in operating profit—a significant improvement from a $5.61 billion loss in 2020. This segment’s performance continues to strengthen, with the latest quarterly revenue reaching $11.35 billion, up 35% from $8.41 billion in the same period last year. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ie Google/YouTube, having returned 20.8% in the June quarter, gave a fair bit of that back by falling 8.8%. Its results seemed pretty positive, and appeared to beat expectations. Management claims its AI integration into its search business is working well, and the margin expansion from costs out is expected to continue. Market chatter suggests that the selloff stems from concerns about the high capital spending on servers and data center equipment. Alphabet has made it clear that this spending is necessary, and somewhat defensive as it can’t risk losing the AI war (a “build it, and they will come” approach). Also, the new Department of Justice case against it probably did not help matters. Nonetheless, we saw no need to adjust our estimates. We wrote last quarter that it traded at a premium to our valuation, but not so much as to warrant selling. With the share price falling and the premium reducing, our view is unchanged. It represents 4.4% of the Fund.” Overall, GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Oracle’s (ORCL) Strong Earnings and AI Partnership: What’s Next for the Software Giant?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other top performing dividend stocks in 2024. Over time, dividend stocks have shown consistent resilience in difficult market conditions. Despite the recent focus on AI, the long-term appeal of these stocks has grown. Income investors have noticed this shift, reflected in the increasing role of dividends in personal income. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that the share of dividend income has risen from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024, emphasizing the importance of dividends as a key income source. The report also noted that since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than a third of total equity returns in the broader market, with the rest coming from capital gains. The dividend growth strategy seems to be working for long-term investors as these stocks have generated strong returns over the years. Considering inflation, dividends have outpaced it, suggesting that investors should focus on these stocks. A report by Wisdom Tree highlighted that from 1957 to 2023, dividends grew at an average annual rate of 5.7%, which is over 2% higher than the inflation rate. The report also pointed out that dividends have only decreased in six years during the past 64 years, and only once by more than 5%. In comparison, stock prices fell in 18 of those years, with the worst decline exceeding 40% and an average drop of over 11%. Stock prices were more than twice as volatile as dividend cash flows, as short-term price movements are more influenced by market sentiment, while long-term value is driven by the stability of cash flows. READ ALSO: 10 Dividend Stocks For Steady Income This year, dividend stocks have underperformed compared to the broader market. The Dividend Aristocrat Index has gained only 6% year-to-date, while the market has surged by over 27%. Although this might seem discouraging for dividend investors, seasoned investors recognize that this presents a great opportunity to buy dividend stocks. Chris O’Keefe, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management, pointed out that the widening performance gap between the market and dividend stocks in 2024 creates an ideal time for investors to consider these equities. Along with O'Keefe, many analysts are encouraging investors to focus on dividend stocks due to their favorable outlook. The Dividend Aristocrats index has struggled to keep pace with the market since 2020. Dividend stocks saw a brief resurgence in 2022 as recession concerns led investors to seek out stable sectors like utilities and consumer goods, but the recovery was short-lived. By 2023, rising interest rates made bond and money-market returns more attractive than dividend yields, causing companies to adopt a more cautious stance and conserve cash amid economic uncertainty. This year, many of the top-performing stocks from the COVID era have once again driven the market to new highs. Despite underperforming for the past two consecutive years, analysts remain optimistic about dividend stocks. They believe that dividend-paying equities could see a resurgence in 2025, as investors are increasingly seeking cash returns. The broader market’s dividend yield recently dropped to a 20-year low, falling below 1.19%, significantly lower than the long-term historical average of 4.3%. With interest rates rising on risk-free investments like Treasuries, companies are recognizing the growing competition for yield. As a result, many are responding by increasing dividends or introducing them for the first time. Notably, several major technology companies began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market that they are positioning themselves as value plays within a high-growth sector. A team of IT professionals meticulously crafting a large-scale enterprise performance management system. For this article, we first used a stock screener to identify stocks that have reported positive returns in 2024 so far. From this selection, we chose dividend stocks with the highest year-to-date (YTD) as of December 25. The stocks were then arranged in ascending order of their YTD gains. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Year-to-Date Return as of December 25: 64.7% Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is an American software company, based in Texas. The company is mainly known for its top-notch data center infrastructure crucial to AI development and is facing demand that exceeds its current supply. The company's efficient operations have made it a preferred partner for leading AI startups, such as OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk’s xAI. Despite these efforts, Oracle is still struggling to meet the high demand, with 162 data centers either operational or under construction as of the first quarter of fiscal 2025. To address this challenge, the company plans to significantly expand, aiming to grow its data center network to between 1,000 and 2,000 in the future. The stock has surged by nearly 65% since the start of 2024, which makes it one of the best performing stocks on our list. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) reported strong earnings in fiscal Q2 2025, with revenue totaling $14.06 billion, a 9% increase compared to the same period last year. Cloud revenue, which includes both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), reached $5.9 billion, reflecting a 24% growth in both USD and constant currency. Within this segment, cloud infrastructure revenue (IaaS) amounted to $2.4 billion, marking an impressive 52% increase in both USD and constant currency. Oracle's cloud revenue is expected to surpass $25 billion for the current fiscal year. Parnassus Investments made the following comment about ORCL in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) announced second-quarter results that exceeded consensus expectations, driven by growth in its cloud infrastructure business, which is benefiting from demand for AI applications. Investor sentiment was further bolstered by the company’s announcement of a new partnership with Amazon.” Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has a strong cash position which supports its dividend payments. The company has paid regular dividends to shareholders since 2009. Over the last 12 months, its operating cash flow was $20.3 billion and its free cash flow during this period amounted to $9.5 billion. It offers a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.93%, as of December 25. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 91 funds held stakes in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), compared with 93 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $7 billion. Among these hedge funds, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall, ORCL ranks 5th on our list of the best performing dividend stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential for ORCL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: TikTok Ban: Free-Speech Groups, Members of Congress Urge Supreme Court to Save App on First Amendment Grounds

Groups alleging China's government has engaged in human-rights violations argue U.S. Constitution does not protect TikTok as “an unregistered foreign agent” By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Ahead of the Supreme Court‘s Jan. 10 hearing on whether to grant TikTok an emergency injunction to prevent it from being banned by the U.S. government, several groups and members of Congress have weighed in on the issue — both against the law, arguing it violates First Amendment rights of TikTok’s users, and in support of the ban because of national security concerns over its Chinese parent company. The Supreme Court agreed to hear TikTok’s appeal for an emergency injunction blocking a federal law — the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act — that will ban the popular video app unless Chinese parent ByteDance sells its stake. The high court scheduled arguments to hear TikTok’s appeal on Friday, Jan. 10, on an expedited timeline that will let the court consider the issue before the law is set to take effect on Jan. 19. According to the court’s docket, a total of two hours is allotted for oral argument. “The parties are directed to brief and argue the following question: Whether the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as applied to petitioners, violates the First Amendment,” the Supreme Court’s docket listing for the case said. Related Stories VIP+ Why the 2024 Game Awards Dialed Back Its Hollywood Element Disney+ Lands Exclusive French Broadcast Rights to 2025 Oscars Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), along with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), filed an amicus brief with the court Friday in support of TikTok’s appeal. “All three are strong advocates of free expression and are deeply concerned that the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act will deprive millions of Americans of their First Amendment rights,” they said in the brief. Popular on Variety SEE ALSO: Trump Urges Supreme Court to Halt TikTok Ban While His Administration Works Out a ‘Negotiated Resolution’ “The TikTok ban does not survive First Amendment scrutiny,” Markey, Paul and Khanna wrote. “Its only historical parallels are illegitimate. Its principal justification — preventing covert content manipulation by the Chinese government — reflects a desire to control the content on the TikTok platform and in any event could be achieved through a less restrictive alternative. And its secondary justification of protecting users’ data from the Chinese government could not sustain the ban on its own and also overlooks that Congress did not consider whether less drastic mitigation measures could address those concerns.” Also backing TikTok in an amicus brief were eight free-speech groups — the ACLU, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Democracy & Technology, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, Progressive Policy Institute, Fight for the Future and Public Knowledge. In their brief, they noted “the government has not presented credible evidence of ongoing or imminent harm caused by TikTok.” “Banning TikTok would trample on the constitutional rights of over 170 million Americans,” Patrick Toomey, deputy director of ACLU’s National Security Project, said in a statement. “This social media platform has allowed people around the world to tell their own stories in key moments of social upheaval, war and natural disaster while reaching immense global audiences. The government’s attempt to cut U.S. users off from speaking and sharing on TikTok is extraordinary and unprecedented.” He added that TikTok “is a unique forum for expression online — and the connections and community that so many have built there cannot be easily replaced. TikTok creators can’t simply transfer their audiences and followers to another app, and TikTok users can’t simply reassemble the many voices they’ve discovered on the platform.” In a separate amicus brief, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, Free Press and PEN America also urged the Supreme Court to strike down the federal TikTok ban. In their brief, the groups argued the law is viewpoint-motivated because it “forecloses an entire medium of expression online.” The group claimed the government has no legitimate interest in banning Americans from accessing foreign speech, even if that speech reflects foreign manipulation, and that while the government has a legitimate interest in protecting U.S. citizens from covert propaganda and safeguarding their personal data, those interests can be achieved through less restrictive means. “Restricting citizens’ access to foreign media is a practice that has long been associated with repressive regimes, and we should be very wary of letting the practice take root here,” said Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute. “Upholding the ban would do lasting damage to the First Amendment and our democracy.” On the other side, seven human-rights groups — which said they are “dedicated to shedding light on the blatant human rights violations occurring in the People’s Republic of China” — filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in favor of the TikTok divest-or-ban law. The groups (Campaign for Uyghurs, the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Watch, International Campaign for Tibet, Uyghur American Association, Uyghur Human Rights Project and Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation) argued the law is constitutional and a “necessary step toward protecting the physical and digital safety of those who seek to illuminate the atrocities occurring in the PRC.” “TikTok under its current corporate structure is a clear instrument for the CCP to harass, target and silence activists and dissidents in the U.S., the PRC, and around the world,” the group said. “In sum, we stand for the proposition that the U.S. Constitution does not protect a PRC company’s right to act as an unregistered foreign agent — covertly shaping the American information environment through a nonexpressive algorithm at the instruction of a foreign adversary government.” According to the law, in the absence of a “qualified divestiture” by ByteDance, the TikTok ban will go into effect Jan. 19 — unless the law is blocked by the Supreme Court. The law gives the U.S. president the ability to grant a one-time extension of “not more than 90 days” if the president determines that ByteDance has a legitimate sales negotiation in progress to sell its TikTok stake; if that’s the case, the sell-or-ban date would be April 19, 2025. After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in a Dec. 6 ruling rejected TikTok’s argument that the law unconstitutionally infringes Americans’ First Amendment rights, TikTok and ByteDance filed the appeal with the Supreme Court seeking the emergency injunction. The D.C. Circuit, in its unanimous 3-0 ruling, said the law does “not target speech based upon its communicative content. The TikTok-specific provisions instead straightforwardly require only that TikTok divest its platform as a precondition to operating in the United States.” According to the court, the U.S. government “has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the Act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.” President Biden signed the TikTok divest-or-ban bill into law on April 24, 2024, after it passed in Congress with solid bipartisan support. U.S. lawmakers have expressed deep concern about TikTok’s Chinese ownership, suggesting that the Chinese communist regime could use the app to spy on Americans or use it to promulgate pro-China propaganda. The law’s backers have argued that it is not a ban of TikTok per se, because it would allow TikTok to continue to be distributed in the U.S. if ByteDance divests its stake in TikTok to a party or parties not based in a country the U.S. designates a “foreign adversary.” In an amicus brief submitted to the Supreme Court on Dec. 18, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urged the Supreme Court to reject TikTok’s request for an emergency injunction. “TikTok is a wildly popular social-media application under the direct control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),” the senator wrote. The “clear national-security threat posed by this application” prompted Congress to pass the law, which, by forcing a sale by ByteDance, would “remove[] the control of this popular application from the primary geopolitical opponent of the United States.” McConnell wrote that “Any such injunction will move the divesture date beyond that prescribed by law —and into a new presidential administration. TikTok clearly hopes that the next administration will be more sympathetic to its plight than the incumbent administration. In other words, delay is the point.” President-elect Donald Trump was noncommittal when he was asked at a press conference earlier this month whether he would try to reverse the TikTok law, responding, “We’ll take a look at TikTok.” Trump added, “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok” because of his belief that the app helped drive young voters toward his side of the ballot. VIP+ Analysis: TikTok Has Entered the Realm of the Internet Traffic “Supergiants” During his first term as president, Trump was unsuccessful in his efforts to force ByteDance to sell majority control in TikTok to U.S. owners, also citing national security fears. Trump’s divest-or-ban executive order was found unconstitutional by federal courts on First Amendment grounds. A year ago, a federal judge blocked Montana’s first-of-its-kind statewide ban of TikTok, ruling that the law likely violated the First Amendment. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, at a March 2023 hearing held by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, asserted that “ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government.” ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group.

Title: Jim Cramer on Uber Technologies, Inc. (UBER): ‘It Is Up A Lot This Month, So Let’s Be Careful And Only Buy Some, Not All’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-uber-technologies-inc-180554046.html
Time Published: 2024-12-27T18:05:54Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bearish Calls: 10 Tech Stocks Heading for a Crash. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against the other tech stocks. For Jim Cramer, tech stocks and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts are a major talking point. Investors continued to deal with an uncertain macroeconomic picture that was complicated by a 'bullish dove' of a Fed that cut interest rates by 25 basis points but also hinted that 2025 would see fewer rate cuts than expected. The day the Fed announced the interest rate cut, the benchmark flagship S&P index sank by 2.95%, with more speculative investments such as Bitcoin dropping by a sharper 8.6%. Yet, as has been the case with the macroeconomic picture, the sell-off appeared to be a bit too much. Two days later, on Friday, the Commerce Department released the ever-important Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) dataset. The PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation reading, and it revealed that the annualized inflation in November was 2.4%. This reading was shy of 0.1 percentage point of economist expectations. As a result, it signaled to investors that perhaps the Fed might take it easy with the interest rates heading into 2025. The slightly improved expectations saw the S&P gain 1.86% on the day of the PCE data release. Cramer was optimistic as well, sharing that the data was "somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday." However, he added that the bullish data release didn't mean that markets would reverse all their losses since Wednesday. Despite the fact that inflation ticked lower, the S&P index is still down 1.83% since the data release. Cramer shared some insight into the reasons behind the weakness. According to him, the market has been speculating a lot on areas such as quantum computing and Bitcoin. The CNBC host outlined that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" had driven the market performance ahead of the rate announcement. Consequently, since these areas lack fundamentals, investors might not have immediately returned to them. His Squawk on the Street appearance the day after the rate cut was also full of pessimism for quantum computing stocks. These stocks have gained as much as 162% over the past month - a development that would, on the surface, indicate a groundbreaking shift in their prospects. However, these movements have been driven primarily by Google's Willow quantum computing chip. The hype surrounding quantum computing is understandable as Willow claims to solve a problem that would take a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years to solve in less than five minutes. However, Cramer remains unconvinced about this technology niche. Commenting on the stock that ranked 16th on this list of stocks that he talked about, the host wondered what had driven its 162% in returns. Likening quantum computing stocks to non-fungible tokens, Cramer commented: "How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” As for the Fed, he believes that the central bank's data-dependent strategies backfired with the bullish rate outlook as "they chose not to be data-dependent." On the episode of Mad Money aired the day of the rate cut, he speculated that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to have been "caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn’t back it up." Cramer added that he believed "It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” On the next day, Cramer added the Fed might have been better off ahead of the call not having signaled that it was going to cut rates. However, as it did the opposite, it was locked into cutting rates while the data pointed towards a robust economy that might not have needed lower interest rates. "I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates," shared Cramer and added that the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped.” For 2025, Cramer wants investors to focus on stocks that might change the world. In a recent Mad Money episode, he outlined that some stocks tend to stand against the tide due to fiercely loyal followers. Sharing some advice, Cramer stated: “There’s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we’re in one of those moments. In 2025, let’s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.” Our Methodology To make our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech stock calls, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks he was bearish on, analyzed their performance, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close up view of a hand holding a smartphone, using a ride sharing app. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 136 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-26-24 Performance Since Then: -15% Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is the biggest ride-sharing service provider in America. Estimates show that the firm controls 76% of US ride-sharing spending, and this business also accounted for 51% of its revenue during H1 2024. Consequently, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) depends on consumer spending and economic activity for its financial and share price health. The stock fell by 7% in October when bookings for the quarter missed analyst estimates, and overall, it has gained a modest 5.70% year-to-date. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is also facing competition in the autonomous driving market, as was evident in December when the shares fell by 9.6% after Google's Waymo announced that it would be expanding to Miami. Here's what Cramer said in August: "I actually like buying some Uber here and then waiting for a little bit of a pullback. Uber is doing incredibly well, and you may not get that pullback, so I want you to get some on the sheets as we talk about it. It is up a lot this month, so let's be careful and only buy some, not all." Overall UBER ranks 2nd among the tech stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UBER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE: FDX, $278.66, Market Capitalization: $67.1 billion) announced that its Board of Directors had concluded a comprehensive assessment of the role of FedEx Freight as part of its portfolio and has decided to pursue a full separation of FedEx Freight through the capital markets, creating a new publicly traded company (for more information, visit spinoffresearch.com). Earlier, FedEx disclosed in June 2024 that it was weighing options for the LTL business, which involves carrying multiple shipments from different customers on a single truck. The Company intends to execute the planned separation through a capital markets transaction, creating two independent, publicly listed, industry-leading companies. The transaction is expected to qualify as a tax-free separation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company expects to commence the separation process immediately, with the intent to execute the transaction within 18 months, subject to regulatory and certain other conditions and final approval of the FedEx Board of Directors. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is serving as the financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is serving as legal counsel. FedEx Price Performance Spin-Off Details and Top 5 Shareholders The Company also announced its 2Q25 results on 12/19. The Company revised its FY25 outlook, where the Company expects flat revenue year over year, compared to the prior forecast of a low single-digit percentage increase. The Company expects Diluted EPS of $16.45 to $17.45 before the MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments compared to the prior forecast of $17.90 to $18.90 per share; and $19.00 to $20.00 per share after also excluding costs related to business optimization initiatives, compared to the prior forecast of $20.00 to $21.00 per share. Key Data Deal Rationale The spin-off of the Freight business was announced as FedEx trimmed its full year profit forecast, highlighting how FedEx’s main businesses continue to struggle with weak demand, especially in the U.S. at its Express unit. As per Raj Subramaniam, FedEx Corp. President and Chief Executive Officer, it is the right time to pursue a separation while the company navigates through the unique dynamics of the LTL market. Analysts have long argued that Freight was undervalued within FedEx, which has been slashing expenses and consolidating its express and ground operations to compete with delivery rivals like Old Dominion (ODFL), United Parcel Service (UPS), XPO (XPO), and Saia (SAIA). Year to date, the Company’s stock gained 10.5%, underperforming the S&P 500 index by 16.8%. With the spin-off of Freight from the rest of the Company, the management believes it will be able to achieve a premium valuation for its Freight business similar to its LTL competitors, most notably Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL). FedEx Freight, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, is estimated to have an enterprise value of more than $30 billion within the next 18 months, while a leading brokerage firm estimates the value between $30 billion and $35 billion. FedEx has identified strategic opportunities in separating FedEx Freight into an independent company while maintaining collaborative ties. The separation will enhance operational focus, accountability, and agility, enabling both entities to capture profitable growth and unlock market value. FedEx will continue advancing initiatives like DRIVE, Network 2.0, and Tricolor. Distinct public stock listings will provide unique investment profiles, strengthening the value proposition for each Company. Both entities will have strong balance sheets, allowing flexibility for growth investments and shareholder returns. Operational, commercial, and technological synergies will be preserved through agreements to ensure continuity, enhance speed, and reduce costs. The FedEx brand will remain unified, extending its values of speed, reliability, and trust across both businesses, with the new Company operating as FedEx Freight. Post separation, FedEx expects to deliver significant value to its stockholders through its transformation and strategic initiatives, focused on reducing the Company’s cost to serve while helping customers compete and win with the world’s smartest and most efficient logistics ecosystem. The initiatives underway through DRIVE are expected to create $4 billion in cost savings by the end of FY25. In comparison, Network 2.0 is targeted to generate savings of $2 billion by the end of fiscal year 2027, supporting enhanced profitability and driving greater flexibility and efficiency across the network. FedEx remains committed to a continued strong balance sheet at both entities while continuing to reduce capital intensity and increase capital returns. Post spin-off, FedEx Freight will be the largest LTL carrier with the broadest network and fastest transit times in its industry. The Company already has a market share of around 17% and has deep and long-standing relationships with customers who value choice, simplicity, and reliability. With a focus on safety, facility utilization, revenue quality, and operational efficiency, FedEx Freight has maintained its leading market share position while increasing operating profit by nearly 2% on average per year over the last five years. The business has delivered approximately 1,100 basis points of operating margin expansion over the same period. FedEx Freight is expected to benefit from a strong balance sheet that will allow it to maintain and extend its leadership position in the LTL market. FedEx Corporation (FDX) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997, to serve as the parent holding Company and provide strategic direction to the FedEx portfolio of companies. FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services, offering integrated business solutions utilizing its flexible, efficient, and intelligent global network. The Company operated under two business segments, the Federal Express segment and the FedEx Freight segment. FY24 Segment Revenue and FY24 Geographical Revenue Federal Express Segment Federal Express pioneered the express transportation industry over 50 years ago in 1973 and remains the industry leader today, providing a range of rapid, reliable, time- and day-definite delivery services to more than 220 countries and territories through an integrated air-ground express network. In connection with its one FedEx consolidation, on June 1, 2024, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services were merged into Federal Express. As of June 7, 2024, Federal Express employed approximately 430,000 employees and had approximately 64,000 drop-off locations (including FedEx Office stores and FedEx OnSite locations, such as nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores), nearly 700 aircraft, and over 175,000 motorized vehicles in its global network. Federal Express contracts with approximately 6,000 independent small businesses to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations. Federal Express also provides cross-border enablement and technology solutions and e-commerce transportation solutions. FedEx Freight Segment FedEx Freight is a leading North American provider of LTL freight services, offering choice, simplicity, and reliability to meet the needs of LTL shippers — FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet a customer’s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost savings; and FedEx Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the growing e-commerce market for delivery of big and bulky products to or through the door for residences and businesses. Through one comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually every U.S. ZIP Code (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. FedEx Freight Priority has the fastest published transit times of any nationwide LTL service. Internationally, FedEx Freight Canada offers FedEx Freight Priority service, serving most points in Canada, as well as FedEx Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy service between the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, FedEx Freight A.M. Delivery offers freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. within and between the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Freight Mexico offers FedEx Freight Priority to deliver cross-border and intra-Mexico LTL shipments door-to-door. Customers receive support from the FedEx Freight International Services team to monitor LTL freight shipments, review customer paperwork, and follow up to avoid shipping delays when shipments are crossing borders. FedEx Freight provides additional services to Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands via alliances. Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers’ time-critical needs with industry leading transit times. With the expansion of FedEx electronic solutions, LTL shippers have the convenience of a single shipping and tracking solution for FedEx Freight and Federal Express. These solutions make freight shipping easier and provide customers with easy access to their account information. Customers can also process domestic and cross-border LTL shipments to and from Canada and Mexico, as well as intra-Canada and -Mexico shipments, through FedEx Ship Manager at fedex.com, FedEx Ship Manager Software, FedEx Web Services, FedEx API, and LTL Select. FedEx Freight uses radio frequency identification technology and customized software to improve shipment visibility on its docks and enhance custodial control at the handling unit level. FedEx Freight Direct addresses the growing e-commerce market for big and bulky products. It has four delivery service levels to meet customer needs, with basic and basic by appointment-to-the-door services and standard through-the-door service available to nearly 100% of the U.S. population. Premium through the- door service with packaging removal is available to 90% of the continental U.S. population. The services include flexible delivery windows, end-to-end visibility, proactive notifications, and returns services with flexible pickup windows and label-less options. As of June 7, 2024, the FedEx Freight segment was operating nearly 30,000 motorized vehicles from a network of approximately 360 service centers and had approximately 40,000 employees. Lance D. Moll is the President of FedEx Freight, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. Financial Overview 2Q25 For 2Q25, the Company recorded revenue of $21.97 billion, down by 0.9% YoY compared to $22.17 billion in the prior year. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to decline in volume and fuel surcharges. Revenue decline was due to lower revenue growth in both FedEx Express and Freight segments. Operating income was $1.05 billion, down 17.6% YoY, compared to $1.3 billion in 2Q24. Operating income margin was 4.8%, down by 100 bps. The decline in operating income was due to lower demand for U.S. domestic package and freight LTL services impacted by macroeconomic factors, increased purchased transportation and wage rates, and higher business optimization costs. Net income for the period was $741 million, down by 17.7% YoY compared to $900 million in 2Q24, and diluted EPS was $3.03 per share, down by 14.6% YoY. 1H25 For 1H25, the Company recorded revenues of $43.5 billion, down by 0.7% YoY, due to lower volume and fuel surcharges, partially offset by base yield improvement at both transportation segments. Additionally, 1H25 revenue was negatively affected by one fewer operating day at both of transportation segments and reduced demand surcharges at Federal Express. Operating income for the period was $2.1 billion, down by 22.8% YoY, with an operating margin of 4.9%, down by 140 bps compared to the prior year period. The decline in operating income was primarily due to lower demand for U.S. domestic package and freight LTL services driven by macroeconomic factors, increased purchased transportation and wage rates, and higher business optimization costs. The results were also negatively affected by one fewer operating day and lower demand surcharges. This was partially offset by increased demand for international export package services, base yield improvements at Federal Express and FedEx Freight, and continued cost savings related to DRIVE. Net income for the period was $1.5 billion, down by 22.4% YoY compared to $1.98 billion in 1H24, and diluted EPS was $6.24 per share, down by 19.9% YoY. Segmental Information 2Q25 For 2Q25, The FedEx Express segment recorded revenues of $18.84 billion, up slightly by 0.4% YoY. The lower growth in revenue was due to lower priority package volume, the expiration of the contract (Sep 29) with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to provide the USPS domestic transportation services, and reduced fuel surcharges, partially offset by increased deferred package volume and improved base yields. Operating income for the period was $1.05 billion, up by 1.6% YoY, with an operating margin of 5.6%, up by 10 bps. The increase in operating income was due to higher base yields, partially offset by increased operating expenses. 1H25 Federal Express segment revenue was $37.1 billion, down slightly by 0.1% YoY, due to lower priority package and U.S. freight volume, partially offset by increased deferred package volume and improved yields. 1H25 revenue was also negatively affected by one fewer operating day and reduced demand surcharges. Federal Express segment operating income was $2.0 billion, down by 14% YoY, with a margin of 5.4%, down by 90 bps. The decline in operating income was due to increased operating expenses and one fewer operating day, partially offset by higher base yields. The increase in operating expenses was due to increased wage and purchased transportation rates, business optimization costs, and increased employee benefits, partially offset by lower fuel prices and continued benefits from DRIVE initiatives that drove a reduction in permanent cost structure. These initiatives included the continued transformation of its structural network, improving the efficiency of information technology and back-office functions, optimizing operations in Europe, and increasing linehaul efficiencies. FedEx Freight Segment 2Q25 For 2Q25, FedEx Freight segment revenue was $2.2 billion, down by 11.2% YoY, primarily due to lower shipment volumes and reduced yields. Operating income for the segment dropped significantly by 36.5% YoY to $312 million, impacted by the decline in revenue. Operating income margin dropped by 570 bps to 14.3%. The decrease in income was partly offset by reduced operating expenses, with a 22% YoY decline in combined fuel and purchased transportation costs due to lower fuel prices and shipment volumes. Salaries and employee benefits expenses fell by 4% YoY because of reduced staffing to align with lower volumes, though higher wage rates partially offset these savings. Depreciation expenses increased by 38% YoY, primarily due to the absence of a gain on facility sales recorded in 2Q24. 1H25 For 1H25, FedEx Freight segment revenue was $4.5 billion, down by 6.8% YoY, impacted by lower shipment volumes, reduced yields, and one fewer operating day compared to the prior year. Operating income was $751 million, down by 22.8% YoY, and with an operating margin of 16.7%, down by 340 bps. The decline in operating income was primarily due to the revenue shortfall, partially mitigated by lower operating expenses. Combined fuel and purchased transportation costs fell by 16% YoY, reflecting decreased shipment activity and lower fuel prices. Salaries and employee benefits expenses were down 2% YoY due to reduced staffing levels, although higher wage rates offset some of the reductions. Depreciation expenses rose by 17% YoY, attributed to the prior-year gain on the sale of facilities in 1H24. FY25 Outlook FedEx has revised its fiscal 2025 outlook, expecting approximately flat revenue YoY, a downgrade from its earlier forecast of low single-digit growth. Diluted EPS is now projected between $16.45 and $17.45, excluding mark-to-market (MTM) retirement plan accounting adjustments, down from the prior estimate of $17.90 to $18.90. Including adjustments for business optimization costs, EPS is forecasted at $19.00 to $20.00, also lower than the previous $20.00 to $21.00. The effective tax rate (ETR) is now expected to be around 24.0%, revised from 24.5%. While unable to forecast MTM adjustments due to potential material impacts on consolidated financial results, FedEx reaffirmed permanent cost reductions of $2.2 billion from the DRIVE transformation program and capital spending of $5.2 billion focused on network optimization, fleet modernization, and automation. These projections assume stable economic conditions, fuel price expectations, planned stock repurchases, and no new adverse geopolitical or economic developments. Share Repurchase Program FedEx completed $1 billion in share repurchases via open market and accelerated share repurchase transactions during the quarter. Approximately 3.7 million shares were delivered from the transactions, with the decrease in outstanding shares benefiting 2Q results by $0.07 per diluted share. The Company expects to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock during FY25 for a buyback total of $2.5 billion. As of November 30, 2024, $3.1 billion remained available for repurchases under the Company’s 2024 stock repurchase authorization. Cash on hand as of November 30, 2024, was $5.0 billion.

The company that began 2024 in turmoil after Sam Altman's dramatic return has morphed from a cautious non-profit company to an AI powerhouse worth $157 billion. With a $13 billion investment from Microsoft and a deal to power Apple iPhones, the company is on track to generate $11.6 billion in revenue. Game over for all the other suckers trying to elbow their way into the AI market? Hardly. The money flooding into AI continued to reach tsunami proportions throughout 2024, with billions of dollars going into funding dozens of worthy competitors around the world, ranging from China’s Moonshot AI to Paris-based Mistral. During the last week of November alone, Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI pocketed $4 and $5 billion respectively. Investors who once saw OpenAI as the new big thing in tech are spreading their bets across a field of nimble, hungry competitors and anything ending in AI could be the next frontrunner—especially after delays from OpenAI, including Sora, its ballyhooed audio cloning tool (and, supposedly, its next GPT model.) It seems like decades since ChatGPT burst onto the scene with its revolutionary chatbot, which users could communicate with as easily as talking to a friend. (The chatbot launched in November 2022 and added speech in September 2024.) Almost overnight it made Google search look antiquated, something that the olds use. These days, it’s probably the first thing a GenZ thinks about when someone says “AI.” The company that sparked the AI revolution with ChatGPT pushed the boundaries of AI capabilities in 2024 after the boom of GPT-3.5, releasing its multimodal GPT-4o in May with an unprecedented 88.7% score on the MMLU benchmark. By September, its new o1 model—which is supposed to handle complex reasoning—raised the bar again, achieving 83.3% accuracy on International Mathematics Olympiad questions—a massive leap from GPT-4o's 13.4%. With over 200 million weekly active users, OpenAI's influence ran so deep that Google, deep in the throes of the Innovator’s Dilemma, suddenly began to fear for its $160 billion search business. But money and fame don't guarantee a happy ending, especially in tech. Anyone remember the Blackberry? Google certainly isn’t going the way of the Blackberry any time soon. Besides, it’s not like it was caught with its pants down. OpenAI was launched in December, 2015 and two months later, the search giant unveiled its new Gemini Ultra foundational model, with the capacity to process 2 million tokens of context—making OpenAI’s GPT-4 look light weight. AI is so integral to Google that CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company is moving from mobile to an "AI-first" strategy. And not a second too soon: The switch to Gemini boosted the popularity of Google One—the tier that offers access to Gemini Ultra—to over 100 million subscriptions 24 hours after its release. We just crossed 100M Google One subscribers! Looking forward to building on that momentum with our new AI Premium Plan (launched yesterday) offering AI features like Gemini Advanced, plus Gemini in Gmail, Docs + more coming soon. https://t.co/m7zAVop7P6 pic.twitter.com/sMdwJeq0iU — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) February 9, 2024 Google is not just flexing technical muscle; ChatGPT is still widely used but Google may be onto something. Its foundational model also powers its RAG, short for "retrieval augmented generation," platform NotebookLM, which was first conceived to help people handle huge amounts of information and data on big amounts of files. The product didn’t move a needle until an update changed the way people used RAG models. Welcome, Google’s podcast generators. That feature alone was enough to boost the model’s popularity, and increase user engagement with a pretty active Reddit community, interesting social experiments and even some business applications to explore. “I think we’ve learned a lot in the last year; what is really resonating with people, what is really useful, how they’re using it every day,” Raiza Martin, a product manager at Google Labs, told The Independent. Meanwhile, OpenAI has given us a voice mode to talk to, still keeps its 128k token context window, and under legal threat, removed its horny Scarlett Johanson voice. The Gemini lineup has been key for Google’s outstanding performance. Since January 2023, its stock price doubled, reaching an ATH on July 10, 2024. Smaller than Google, but probably as important in terms of its role in the boom of AI chatbots this year is San Francisco-based Anthropic. Founded by former OpenAI researchers, Anthropic emerged as OpenAI's most formidable challenger in 2024, turning heads with explosive growth and deep-pocketed backers. The rivalry between ChatGPT and Claude, Anthropic’s suite of large language models, is the equivalent of the Cold War in AI culture. When one company releases a feature, the other immediately strikes back. The two models are always competing for the top spot in the LLM Arena and the community is always trying to decide which one is the best. Anthropic’s revenue grew over 1,000% this year after the launch of Claude 3.5 Sonnet in June, with a major part powered by third-party API users. Anthropic's rise mirrors the early days of OpenAI, but with an even steeper trajectory. And the investments keep flowing in. Amazon has poured $8 billion into the startup, while Google agreed to invest up to $2 billion. These cash infusions were also probably strategic bets from tech giants hedging against OpenAI's dominance, and a mirror of a proxy war between cloud computing providers, with Microsoft supporting OpenAI to benefit Azure versus Amazon supporting Claude to benefit AWS. Anthropic and OpenAI mine the gold, whereas Microsoft and Amazon basically sell the shovels. Anthropic's success is not just due to its models’ quality. Overall, the company pushes for a broader shift in the AI landscape. While OpenAI chased consumer popularity, Anthropic focused on specialized models that prioritized safety, betting that enterprise customers would pay premium prices for targeted solutions. In Europe, French startup Mistral AI raised eyebrows by securing $1 billion in funding and a $6 billion valuation in June. Its open-source models are matching GPT-4's capabilities at a fraction of the cost. To put this in perspective, this means, according to calculations by Trending Topics, that "Mistral AI is worth €105m per employee," making it the most valuable startup in European history. A recent upgrade called “Le Chat,” is being positioned as Mistral’s ChatGPT killer. It offers basically everything ChatGPT does—for free. It provides good outputs, handles code, generates images, supports agents and browses the web in real time. And Mistral is just getting started, with a planned expansion into the United States and a new office in the belly of the beast in Palo Alto, California. Chinese firms aren't just copying anymore—they're innovating. Even with a major embargo imposed by the United States in an attempt to stifle innovation, companies like Baidu, Alibaba, and Baichuan AI, backed by massive government support, are developing models tailored for emerging markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. They're building a parallel AI ecosystem that could rival anything coming out of San Francisco. Huawei, the massive telecom giant supported by the state, for example, released its own OS and is embedding it into its lineup of smartphones and home devices, creating a fully functional ecosystem. Another Chinese model, Yi Lightning beats GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the LLM Arena, the new Deepseek has come to compete against OpenAI’s reasoning model o1, and Baidu’s Ernie reached 100 million users in December 2023 and boosted its user base to over 200 million users in April 2024 According to the World Economic Forum, China’s AI market is estimated to top $61 billion next year with VCs pouring over $120 billion into AI ecosystems. Believe it or not, Meta plays the role of the good guy in this story. While competitors such as OpenAI and Anthropic fought over market share with expensive, locked-down models, Mark Zuckerberg's company took a different route: open sourcing its technology. Llama 3.2, released in September, showcases just how far Meta's open-source strategy has come. The model processes both text and images, powers everything from augmented reality apps to visual search engines, and with Meta looking to work with U.S. government agencies to use its model on national security applications. And beyond government and corporations, the Llama-powered Meta AI chatbot is a pretty promising ChatGPT competitor. Recently expanded into dozens of countries, the chatbot can generate images of similar or arguably better quality than Dall-e 3 and even animate them (which ChatGPT cannot), search the web, handle coding tasks, and imagine scenes on the spot. Beyond that, Meta has other generative AI models for audio generation, video editing, segmentation, drawing animation, and more With Llama 4 around the corner in 2025, promising even better handling of text, voice, and images, Meta's betting that open beats closed every time. The numbers back up Zuckerberg's gamble. Meta AI, the company's answer to ChatGPT, racked up 500 million monthly users, with India leading the charge. Over a million advertisers jumped on Meta's AI bandwagon in September alone, cranking out 15 million AI-generated ads. The company's revenue shot up 18.9% year-over-year to hit $40.6 billion in Q3, with ad impressions climbing 7% while prices rose 11%. All this AI goodwill doesn't come cheap. Meta's dumping $38 billion into capital expenditure this year, mostly on AI research and the hardware to run it. That includes cramming its data centers with 350,000 of Nvidia's prized H100 AI chips by year's end. But Zuckerberg's playing the long game. By partnering with cloud giants AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure to host Llama models, Meta's building an ecosystem that could reshape how AI technology spreads—and who profits from it. Not bad for a company that lost almost 75% of its value when it started to focus on the "metaverse" and grew 600% since its shift to artificial intelligence as its key business model. Is OpenAI still king of the hill? Technically, maybe. At least it is the most recognizable—and valuable—AI startup in the scene. But the hill itself has changed. The race isn't about raw power anymore—it's about trust, accessibility, and real-world impact, and a few of these areas, notably trust and safety, are a bit murky right now for Sam Altman’s unicorn OpenAI's early lead has evolved into a complex web of specialized players, each carving out their own niches. Some focus on consumer applications, others on enterprise solutions, and a few brave ones tackle the fundamental research that could unlock AGI. For the immediate future, Sam Altman seems very confident OpenAI can reach AGI next year, which would put OpenAI on top of the hill for probably a long, long time if—and this is as “if” as it can get—they succeed. However, other very respected and talented experts, like Meta’s chief of AI research Yan LeCun, believe such achievement is accomplishable in around 10 years or so. Whether you decide to be optimistic or pessimistic will depend on who’s your favorite rockstar. That said, the real winner of 2024's AI race is the users. Competition drives innovation, but it also forces companies to address concerns about safety, privacy, and accessibility. This is why the Amodei brothers left OpenAI to found Anthropic and why Ilya Sutskeyver left to found Safe Superintelligence. This is why Huawei developed its own mobile OS and used domestic technology to build one of the best phones of the year, why developers come up with customized, better versions of the most popular AI models, and why AI as a technology has become a social phenomenon in the last two years. As these AI titans battle for supremacy, they're building tools that transform everything from how we work to how we create and communicate. And that 'one AI to rule them all'? Maybe that was the wrong question all along. In 2025's AI landscape, diversity will likely play an important role. And that might be exactly what we need.

Title: Jim Cramer on Snowflake Inc. (SNOW): ‘I Think I’m Going To Hold Off On Recommending It’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-snowflake-inc-snow-175040895.html
Time Published: 2024-12-27T17:50:40Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bearish Calls: 10 Tech Stocks Heading for a Crash. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) stands against the other tech stocks. For Jim Cramer, tech stocks and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts are a major talking point. Investors continued to deal with an uncertain macroeconomic picture that was complicated by a 'bullish dove' of a Fed that cut interest rates by 25 basis points but also hinted that 2025 would see fewer rate cuts than expected. The day the Fed announced the interest rate cut, the benchmark flagship S&P index sank by 2.95%, with more speculative investments such as Bitcoin dropping by a sharper 8.6%. Yet, as has been the case with the macroeconomic picture, the sell-off appeared to be a bit too much. Two days later, on Friday, the Commerce Department released the ever-important Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) dataset. The PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation reading, and it revealed that the annualized inflation in November was 2.4%. This reading was shy of 0.1 percentage point of economist expectations. As a result, it signaled to investors that perhaps the Fed might take it easy with the interest rates heading into 2025. The slightly improved expectations saw the S&P gain 1.86% on the day of the PCE data release. Cramer was optimistic as well, sharing that the data was "somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday." However, he added that the bullish data release didn't mean that markets would reverse all their losses since Wednesday. Despite the fact that inflation ticked lower, the S&P index is still down 1.83% since the data release. Cramer shared some insight into the reasons behind the weakness. According to him, the market has been speculating a lot on areas such as quantum computing and Bitcoin. The CNBC host outlined that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" had driven the market performance ahead of the rate announcement. Consequently, since these areas lack fundamentals, investors might not have immediately returned to them. His Squawk on the Street appearance the day after the rate cut was also full of pessimism for quantum computing stocks. These stocks have gained as much as 162% over the past month - a development that would, on the surface, indicate a groundbreaking shift in their prospects. However, these movements have been driven primarily by Google's Willow quantum computing chip. The hype surrounding quantum computing is understandable as Willow claims to solve a problem that would take a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years to solve in less than five minutes. However, Cramer remains unconvinced about this technology niche. Commenting on the stock that ranked 16th on this list of stocks that he talked about, the host wondered what had driven its 162% in returns. Likening quantum computing stocks to non-fungible tokens, Cramer commented: "How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” As for the Fed, he believes that the central bank's data-dependent strategies backfired with the bullish rate outlook as "they chose not to be data-dependent." On the episode of Mad Money aired the day of the rate cut, he speculated that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to have been "caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn’t back it up." Cramer added that he believed "It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” On the next day, Cramer added the Fed might have been better off ahead of the call not having signaled that it was going to cut rates. However, as it did the opposite, it was locked into cutting rates while the data pointed towards a robust economy that might not have needed lower interest rates. "I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates," shared Cramer and added that the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped.” For 2025, Cramer wants investors to focus on stocks that might change the world. In a recent Mad Money episode, he outlined that some stocks tend to stand against the tide due to fiercely loyal followers. Sharing some advice, Cramer stated: “There’s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we’re in one of those moments. In 2025, let’s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.” Our Methodology To make our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech stock calls, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks he was bearish on, analyzed their performance, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A software engineer at work, surrounded by a wall of computer monitors connected to a 'Data Cloud' platform. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 71 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-16-24 Performance Since Then: 27.35% Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) is a data warehousing company which estimates show holds a sizable 22% market share. Its business model and market share create unique opportunities in the AI wave as data is the 'oil' of AI models. However, Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)'s shares are down by 13.9% year-to-date as the firm has been hit with a slowdown in the broader cloud industry and battled management issues. The second half of the year has been kinder to Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) as it appears to have regained its footing. The stock is up by 26% since its third-quarter earnings report which beat analyst revenue and product revenue estimates. The release also saw Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) guide Q4 and full-year revenue at $908.5 million and $3.43 billion to beat analyst estimates. Since Cramer's remarks in August, the shares have gained 27.35%. Here's what he said: "The latest feedback I'm getting about Snowflake is that they’re facing some difficulties and are being challenged by a couple of companies. It’s kind of a tough road for them right now. I think I’m going to hold off on recommending it." Overall SNOW ranks 4th among the tech stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently. While we acknowledge the potential of SNOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: HHW Gaming Presents The 2024 Video Game Wrap-Up, Plus Our Pick For Game of The Year
URL: https://hiphopwired.com/playlist/hhw-gaming-presents-the-best-games-2024/
Time Published: 2024-12-27T17:49:29Z

Source: Ubisoft Montpellier / Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown / 2024 Video Game Wrap-Up 2024 has come to a quick end. It has been a rollercoaster of year in video games; we break down the good, bad, and ugly in our wrap-up. 2023 was a year to remember, thanks to releases like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, Dead Space, Resident Evil 4, El Paso, Elsewhere, and more, but don’t get it twisted. 2024 was no pushover due to so many solid releases. There was also some shaky news in the gaming industry, and we will discuss all that and hand out our award for Game of the Year. So let’s wrap up 2024. Source: PlayStation / PS5 Pro Sony’s worst-kept secret, the PS5 Pro, finally arrived after a year and some change of speculation and information leaks. The reveal of Sony’s powerful console refresh landed with a thud with news of the console’s $700 price tag, and that’s without a stand and disc drive because both accessories are optional, leaving many asking, did play have limits? Many then asked if this console was even necessary, despite the company knowingly marketing it to a more niche gamer who prioritizes graphics and frame rates. The consensus on the console at the end of the day was that it provides players with a significant boost in performance and fidelity, but it’s not something you need to rush out and buy. We shall see how the PS5 Pro fares in 2025 and if it was genuinely worth Sony even making it. Our prediction: we expect it to fare well in the new year as developers focus more on the PS5 and Pro models and no longer have to wor optimizing games for the PS4. Source: Bernard Smalls / iOne Digital / HHW Gaming / PS Portal / PlayStation The PS Portal was a big surprise win for Sony. When it was first revealed, the immediate question was, why? It didn’t run natively, had no Bluetooth capability, and was essentially just a companion accessory for the PS5 console, only working off the console’s Remote Play feature. When news of the device started circulating back in 2023, and photos began hitting the web, we immediately felt that Project Q, as it was called at the time, was Sony’s way of testing if they should get back in the still hot handheld market, Nintendo very much dominates that. That turned out to be the case, with PlayStation boss Hideaki Nishino saying that the PS Portal sales were a “huge success” story for the company and adding that the device would continue to “evolve.” With the addition of Cloud Streaming (Beta), we have seen signs of Sony actively developing a native handheld device that will not require you to be tethered to your PS5 console. Sony isn’t alone; Xbox is also working on a handheld device but has yet to pull the lid off what has come up with. Keeping it a buck, if you have been on the fence about the PS Portal, now is a better time than any to consider getting yourself one; this gamer truly appreciates how clutch it is when being in front of the television and console is not an option. Just make sure that the internet and Wi-Fi are up to snuff. Source: Xbox / Xbox Gaming x Amazon Fire TV As we approached the end of the year, Microsoft made its plans for the future abundantly clear: almost all of your devices, not just the black box, are Xboxes. Since Xbox’s mission was clear after its shaky start following the Activision /Blizzard/King acquisition, it was able to regroup after its epic failures. Desperate for wins, Xbox finally got some, but not the conventional way. Instead, they released console exclusives like Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment, followed by Sea of Thieves and Grounded on the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. These titles became best sellers in the PlayStation Store despite lackluster console sales. The highly anticipated Senua’s Sacrifice: Hellblade II, another technical masterpiece from Xbox studio Ninja Theory, was also released in 2024. However, it was also a polarizing game, with critics divided on whether it was worth the wait and whether it should have been considered a big exclusive for the Xbox Series X. Two massive wins for Team Green had to be Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle coming to Xbox Game Pass to high praise. 2025 can be an interesting year for Xbox. Yes, many people are still skeptical about the company’s plans moving forward, mainly because they feel their loyalty has been taken for granted. Still, Xbox was losing, and they realized they needed to pivot. They still have their mid-level refresh console, codenamed Brooklin, the aforementioned native handheld in the works, and plenty of games in the pipeline, so we are still very intrigued. Source: Microsoft / Xbox Yes, it was cool to discuss all of the good things that happened in 2024, but we would not be honest if we didn’t mention the layoffs and the shuttering of numerous video game studios. At the beginning of the year, Microsoft announced it was laying off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees. This was not a good look for a company that had just spent $69 billion to acquire the Call of Duty developer. It continued the trend from 2023 when an estimated 10,500 game industry workers lost their jobs. Xbox also shuttered four of its studios: Tango Gameworks, which delivered the surprise hit Hi-Fi Rush; Redfall developer Arkane Austin; Alpha Dog; and Roundhouse. PlayStation also got in on the act as well, laying off 900 employees in February 2024 and suffering what the biggest miss of the year with its hero shooter, Concord, which never really got to see the light of day following a very poor reception and eventually shuttering the studio behind it, Firewalk was was. Gaming journalism also suffered after Gamestop shut down Game Informer magazine after 33 glorious years and many fire cover stories and exclusives. Gamestop didn’t even give the magazine the proper sendoff it deserved, opting for a lame landing page when you visit the now-defunct publications landing page. What a sad way for the iconic magazine to end. Former Game Informer employees discuss the unceremonious end on the FPS Podcast below. Source: Ubisoft / The Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown In a year that saw plenty of bangers like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Astro Bot, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Helldivers II, Tekken 8, and more, there can only be one HHW Gaming Game of The Year. But determining which game would win our prestigious Game of the Year award wasn’t hard. The winner is Ubisoft Montpellier’s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. There was no doubt that The Lost Crown was a special title from the first time we booted it up in January. In our review of the game, our resident gamer, Beanz, wrote: The Last Crown is a masterpiece; I was hard-pressed to find anything wrong with this game. The combat is snappy and fun to use thanks to the combo system and Sargon’s acquired abilities, allowing for stylish, fast gameplay. While Ubisoft Montreal is hard at work on the Sands of Time remake, Montpellier’s The Lost Crown is not just a placeholder; it’s the perfect pivot for the franchise, putting it on a refreshing path to newfound greatness. Sadly, Sargon’s journey will likely not continue because Ubisoft disbanded the Montpellier team, leaving the game in limbo. This development is disheartening because Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was a unique game with the potential to become a new hit chapter in the iconic video game franchise. We will keep our fingers crossed that Ubisoft will recognize the error of its ways with The Lost Crown, but we’re not holding our breath. Well, that’s it for 2024, onward to 2025. Keep it locked on HHW Gaming for the games we are looking forward to in 2025, and hit the gallery below for other games we thought were bangers in 2024.

Title: Analyst on NVIDIA (NVDA): Investors Should Be ‘Very Vigilant’ Amid Rising Competition

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. Investors are looking for new growth horizons in the AI industry to gauge whether the current market rally can continue for the years to come. Chetan Puttagunta, Benchmark general partner, said he’s noticed a lot of innovation in the past few weeks focused on improving the efficiency of algorithms. “In the last six to eight weeks, we’ve seen a tremendous amount of innovation, especially at the model layer, and then for the last two years at the application layer, taking advantage of all the advances in the AI models. Specifically, what’s happening at the model layer is, as we move into an inference-time or test-time compute paradigm, you’re seeing a lot more advantage to entrepreneurs and technical founders that are able to push to the frontier with algorithmic innovation.” To explain how AI is now actually improving workflows, Puttagunta gave the example of Sierra, a conversational AI startup making customer service solutions. “So think of this Sierra AI agent, if you will, delivering the best customer service agent experience every time, replicated an infinite number of times. And that’s an experience that was previously not possible without AI.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that are making moves amid the latest news. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jessica Lessin, The Information founder, editor-in-chief and CEO, recently discussed the state of AI space and her outlook on 2025. She mentioned the rising competition in the industry. “I think 2025 is going to be the year where all bets are off—or rather, all gloves are off—in AI competition. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will dominate GPUs, but you’re also seeing Broadcom and others partnering with tech companies to diversify. Last week, at The Information, we reported that Broadcom is now working with Apple on an AI chip for inference. While it doesn’t directly compete with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), there is significant competition in the space. I believe investors should stay very vigilant and try to understand the dynamics within each tech company. The key question inside these firms is: how can we build, build, build to create more optionality in AI technology?” Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. Nvidia’s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. Investors are looking for new growth horizons in the AI industry to gauge whether the current market rally can continue for the years to come. Chetan Puttagunta, Benchmark general partner, said he’s noticed a lot of innovation in the past few weeks focused on improving the efficiency of algorithms. “In the last six to eight weeks, we’ve seen a tremendous amount of innovation, especially at the model layer, and then for the last two years at the application layer, taking advantage of all the advances in the AI models. Specifically, what’s happening at the model layer is, as we move into an inference-time or test-time compute paradigm, you’re seeing a lot more advantage to entrepreneurs and technical founders that are able to push to the frontier with algorithmic innovation.” To explain how AI is now actually improving workflows, Puttagunta gave the example of Sierra, a conversational AI startup making customer service solutions. “So think of this Sierra AI agent, if you will, delivering the best customer service agent experience every time, replicated an infinite number of times. And that’s an experience that was previously not possible without AI.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that are making moves amid the latest news. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jessica Lessin, The Information founder, editor-in-chief and CEO, recently discussed the state of AI space and her outlook on 2025. She mentioned the rising competition in the industry. “I think 2025 is going to be the year where all bets are off—or rather, all gloves are off—in AI competition. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will dominate GPUs, but you’re also seeing Broadcom and others partnering with tech companies to diversify. Last week, at The Information, we reported that Broadcom is now working with Apple on an AI chip for inference. While it doesn’t directly compete with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), there is significant competition in the space. I believe investors should stay very vigilant and try to understand the dynamics within each tech company. The key question inside these firms is: how can we build, build, build to create more optionality in AI technology?” Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. Nvidia’s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on ARM Holdings plc (ARM): ‘I Prefer ARM Holdings Over Intel In The Current Tech Landscape’

Time Published: 2024-12-27T16:53:16Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bearish Calls: 10 Tech Stocks Heading for a Crash. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other tech stocks. For Jim Cramer, tech stocks and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts are a major talking point. Investors continued to deal with an uncertain macroeconomic picture that was complicated by a 'bullish dove' of a Fed that cut interest rates by 25 basis points but also hinted that 2025 would see fewer rate cuts than expected. The day the Fed announced the interest rate cut, the benchmark flagship S&P index sank by 2.95%, with more speculative investments such as Bitcoin dropping by a sharper 8.6%. Yet, as has been the case with the macroeconomic picture, the sell-off appeared to be a bit too much. Two days later, on Friday, the Commerce Department released the ever-important Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) dataset. The PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation reading, and it revealed that the annualized inflation in November was 2.4%. This reading was shy of 0.1 percentage point of economist expectations. As a result, it signaled to investors that perhaps the Fed might take it easy with the interest rates heading into 2025. The slightly improved expectations saw the S&P gain 1.86% on the day of the PCE data release. Cramer was optimistic as well, sharing that the data was "somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday." However, he added that the bullish data release didn't mean that markets would reverse all their losses since Wednesday. Despite the fact that inflation ticked lower, the S&P index is still down 1.83% since the data release. Cramer shared some insight into the reasons behind the weakness. According to him, the market has been speculating a lot on areas such as quantum computing and Bitcoin. The CNBC host outlined that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" had driven the market performance ahead of the rate announcement. Consequently, since these areas lack fundamentals, investors might not have immediately returned to them. His Squawk on the Street appearance the day after the rate cut was also full of pessimism for quantum computing stocks. These stocks have gained as much as 162% over the past month - a development that would, on the surface, indicate a groundbreaking shift in their prospects. However, these movements have been driven primarily by Google's Willow quantum computing chip. The hype surrounding quantum computing is understandable as Willow claims to solve a problem that would take a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years to solve in less than five minutes. However, Cramer remains unconvinced about this technology niche. Commenting on the stock that ranked 16th on this list of stocks that he talked about, the host wondered what had driven its 162% in returns. Likening quantum computing stocks to non-fungible tokens, Cramer commented: "How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” As for the Fed, he believes that the central bank's data-dependent strategies backfired with the bullish rate outlook as "they chose not to be data-dependent." On the episode of Mad Money aired the day of the rate cut, he speculated that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to have been "caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn’t back it up." Cramer added that he believed "It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” On the next day, Cramer added the Fed might have been better off ahead of the call not having signaled that it was going to cut rates. However, as it did the opposite, it was locked into cutting rates while the data pointed towards a robust economy that might not have needed lower interest rates. "I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates," shared Cramer and added that the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped.” For 2025, Cramer wants investors to focus on stocks that might change the world. In a recent Mad Money episode, he outlined that some stocks tend to stand against the tide due to fiercely loyal followers. Sharing some advice, Cramer stated: “There’s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we’re in one of those moments. In 2025, let’s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.” Our Methodology To make our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech stock calls, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks he was bearish on, analyzed their performance, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

This enables the firm to enjoy a wide moat, which has strengthened in today's era of data centers and cloud computing. Big tech firms have used ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)'s designs to make in-house chips. The firm has also sought to further solidify its market presence by providing an off-the-shelf solution to firms looking to design chips. However, ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)'s shares are down by 16% over the past six months as they have been driven by the firm's inability to significantly benefit from the ongoing AI boom despite its near-ubiquity in the smartphone industry. In August, Cramer shared that he preferred ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) over Intel, and the latter's stock has lost 5.6% since his comments: "Intel is struggling with competition from AMD and Nvidia, and I prefer ARM Holdings over Intel in the current tech landscape. Intel has challenges but may benefit if it can leverage AI advances effectively." Overall ARM ranks 6th among the tech stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Escalating US-China Trade War to Hurt These Tech Stocks in 2025
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/escalating-us-china-trade-war-153500064.html
Time Published: 2024-12-27T15:35:00Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The ongoing US-China trade war has intensified, with technology being a primary battleground. What began as a tussle over trade imbalances has evolved into a strategic clash over technological supremacy. Over the past few years, the United States has tightened its export restrictions, limiting China's access to advanced semiconductor technologies critical for Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G and supercomputing. Key players like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Micron Technology, Inc. MU, Intel Corporation INTC and QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM have been caught in the crossfire, facing regulatory and market challenges that jeopardize their growth prospects. Recent measures, including the U.S. Commerce Department's export controls on advanced AI chips and chipmaking tools, aim to curb China’s technological advancements. While these restrictions align with the U.S. national security objectives, they have disrupted the semiconductor supply chain and stoked economic tensions. In retaliation, China has imposed restrictions on rare earth metals critical for semiconductor production. The escalating trade war has created a challenging environment for U.S. tech companies reliant on the Chinese market. As we step into 2025, uncertainties surrounding the conflict are poised to affect revenue streams, supply chains and investor sentiment. Here's a closer look at how leading semiconductor players like NVIDIA, Micron, Intel and QUALCOMM could bear the brunt of these challenges. NVIDIA has been a proponent of the U.S. government’s restrictions throughout the past three years. In 2022, the U.S. government restricted NVIDIA from selling its A100, A100X and H100 integrated circuits to China and Russia. In 2023, the United States imposed new restrictions on selling two AI chips — A800 and H800 — specifically created for the Chinese market. This year, the U.S. government restricted the export of NVIDIA's advanced A100 and H100 GPUs to China, a key market for AI development. The U.S. government is continuing its efforts toward restricting China from getting its hands on cutting-edge technologies that can strengthen its military. These kinds of restrictions are going to hurt NVIDIA’s business in China with a negative impact on its top line, margin and cash slows further jeopardizing its ability to support existing customers and complete the development of certain products timely. NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Micron Technology had found itself in the middle of this tug-of-war long ago. For the company, chip sales in China make up more than 10% of its total revenues. In October 2022, the United States imposed an export ban on certain advanced chips that are used in data centers for AI, data analytics and computing applications with the intention of stopping these chips from getting into Chinese hands. Later in 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China imposed a restriction on Micron on selling its products in key domestic industries on national security concerns. Tit-for-tat actions like these have the potential to jeopardize the company’s prospects, which are already afflicted by the weak demand for its memory chips. Moreover, the memory chip market’s cyclical nature, combined with these geopolitical tensions, could exacerbate its financial volatility in 2025. Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote Intel’s total revenues experienced a whopping 27% contribution from its Chinese customers in 2023. The company faces unique challenges due to its reliance on both China for manufacturing and the United States for research & development. China’s latest stance of replacing U.S.-made chips with domestic alternatives has become a concern for Intel. The country’s latest decision to phase out foreign chips from its major telecom networks by 2027, coupled with the U.S. government’s directive to revoke Intel’s chip export licenses to the Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei, has a big potential to affect the company’s top line. Although Intel has been heavily investing in its foundry business to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing, these efforts may take years to bear fruit. The company’s struggles to regain market leadership in the face of geopolitical headwinds could further pressure its bottom line and stock performance in 2025. Intel Corporation price-consensus-chart | Intel Corporation Quote QUALCOMM has a lot to lose from the US-China trade war as a major part of its business comes from China. The company has also set up multiple manufacturing facilities in China. In early 2024, Qualcomm faced the same restrictions as Intel where the U.S. government revoked its chip export license for certain technologies to Huawei. Retaliation from the Chinese trade associations and government can worsen QCOM’s situation. The Chinese government has already put policies, such as the Made in China 2025 initiative aiming for 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025. These policies can enable QUALCOMM’s existing customers to develop their own chipsets . QUALCOMM Incorporated price-consensus-chart | QUALCOMM Incorporated Quote The escalating US-China tech war presents a formidable challenge for U.S. semiconductor companies like NVIDIA, Micron, Intel and Qualcomm. These companies are not only grappling with the immediate effects of export restrictions and retaliatory measures but also facing long-term structural shifts in global supply chains and competitive dynamics. Investors should exercise caution and closely monitor developments in the trade conflict as these could significantly impact the semiconductor industry’s growth trajectory in 2025. While U.S. tech stocks have historically been robust performers, the geopolitical landscape could bring volatility that warrants careful portfolio positioning. At present, NVIDIA and QUALCOMM each carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Micron and Intel each have a Zaks Rank #3 (Hold).

We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. CJ Muse, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, explained in a latest program on CNBC that the AI investment cycle is different from the ones we have seen in the past. Muse believes major technology companies investing billions in AI are generating “meaningful” free cash flows. “This cycle is unlike any other. I think most investors look back to the advent of the internet and how long the internet infrastructure investment cycle played out. But this one’s very different. The companies making the investments, predominantly the hyperscalers, are generating meaningful free cash flow despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars building out AI. Let’s be clear: this is existential for these companies as they all try to get to AGI. I think this is a multi-year investment cycle.” The analyst talked about the latest AI model released by OpenAI and said the race is now to reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) and companies would require more and more computing power to improve the reasoning capabilities of AI systems. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently making headlines on the back of latest analyst ratings and important news.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 128 Vijay Rakesh, Mizuho senior semiconductor analyst, said in a latest program on CNBC that Broadcom shares have more room to run: “Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), on the other hand, is just starting to put up massive numbers now. I think we like the name; they have a huge ramp coming up over the next two years. It’s very under-owned. People were cautious heading into earnings, and so we think there is probably some more legs left to the run.” Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. However, the stock could face the impact of what Nvidia is facing today: too high expectations. In the latest quarterly results, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) revenue was largely in line with estimates. The company has narrowly exceeded revenue expectations by less than 5% in most cases. Some analysts suggest Broadcom’s growth rates will moderate to below 20% CAGR starting the first quarter of 2025. In fiscal Q4, it was +50% topline growth. The market won’t be kind to the stock when the revenue growth rate slows. Broadcom has about $58 billion in net debt, which is relatively high. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Similar to the earnings results for Nvidia, shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) initially sold off after the company reported solid earnings that fell light of elevated market expectations, but the stock did recover from its drawdown in the matter of a few weeks. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company’s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.” Overall, AVGO ranks 4th on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. CJ Muse, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, explained in a latest program on CNBC that the AI investment cycle is different from the ones we have seen in the past. Muse believes major technology companies investing billions in AI are generating “meaningful” free cash flows. “This cycle is unlike any other. I think most investors look back to the advent of the internet and how long the internet infrastructure investment cycle played out. But this one’s very different. The companies making the investments, predominantly the hyperscalers, are generating meaningful free cash flow despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars building out AI. Let’s be clear: this is existential for these companies as they all try to get to AGI. I think this is a multi-year investment cycle.” The analyst talked about the latest AI model released by OpenAI and said the race is now to reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) and companies would require more and more computing power to improve the reasoning capabilities of AI systems.

Title: OpenAI Lays Out For-Profit Business Strategy Amid Microsoft Talks, Musk Feud

Title: OpenAI may become a for-profit because it needs 'more capital than imagined'
URL: https://qz.com/openai-for-profit-sam-altman-investors-capital-musk-xai-1851729227
Time Published: 2024-12-27T15:15:00Z

OpenAI has revealed a plan to restructure its operations and more cleanly separate the for-profit and non-profit arms of its business as it seeks to raise more cash. The artificial intelligence startup has been discussing plans to restructure for several months now, according to various reports, as it tries to attract new investors. OpenAI raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion evaluation in its latest round of funding, which was reportedly led by Joshua Kushner’s Thrive Capital and backed by Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). But that’s not enough. “The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission,” OpenAI’s board wrote in a new blog post. “We once again need to raise more capital than we’d imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.” Under OpenAI’s current structure, the company’s investors are issued equity by its for-profit arm, which is overseen by its non-profit board, whose “principal beneficiary is humanity, not OpenAI investors.” The company announced its “capped profit” structure in 2019, after founding the company in 2015 as a non-profit. “As we enter 2025, we will have to become more than a lab and a startup — we have to become an enduring company,” OpenAI wrote, adding that its plans “enable us to raise the necessary capital with conventional terms like others in this space.” The ChatGPT maker’s new plan includes establishing the for-profit arm of OpenAI as a public benefit company (PBC), mirroring a step taken by xAI — helmed by OpenAI founder Elon Musk — as well as Anthropic. Although such companies have a stated goal of positively impacting society, the pivot to establish AI firms as PBCs has led to accusations of “ethicswashing.” By setting up the for-profit arm as a PBC, OpenAI’s current board will be able to consider the interests of investors more easily, which could help it win over potential shareholders. xAI, despite being less than two years old, raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation earlier this month, while Anthropic has raised almost $14 billion in venture capital since it was founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI employees. Although details were not revealed by OpenAI on Friday, previous discussions had explored giving CEO Sam Altman about $150 billion of equity, according to Reuters. The non-profit side of the business will hire its own leadership team and staff to engage in charity involving the healthcare, education, and science sectors, according to OpenAI. It will also own “significant interest” in the for-profit side through stock determined at a “fair evaluation” determined by third-party advisors. OpenAI’s plans face a few hurdles, including a slew of recent executive departures and a revived lawsuit from Musk, who wants to stop the company from becoming a for-profit. In November, Musk expanded his lawsuit against the AI startup and several of its co-founders, accusing it of anticompetitive behavior and calling it a “market-paralyzing gorgon.” Later in the month, Musk’s attorneys filed a preliminary injunction against the AI startup, several of its co-founders, and Microsoft to stop its transition to a for-profit company. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The AI stock trade is starting to shift beyond the 'Magnificent 7'
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ai-stock-trade-is-starting-to-shift-beyond-the-magnificent-7-151133023.html
Time Published: 2024-12-27T15:11:33Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Investor enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence has once again driven the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks to another banner year, with Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) stocks all recently hitting record highs while Nvidia (NVDA) shares boast a more than 175% gain this year. Next year, investors expect the hype to spread even further into areas like utilities and software stocks, which will continue to benefit from Big Tech's large AI bet. Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin projects the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will reach 6,500 by the end of 2025 and that the rest of the market's gains will come closer to those of large-cap tech stocks. "It's less about valuation but more about earnings growth that will dictate those returns," Kostin said during a Goldman Sachs 2025 media roundtable with reporters. "The narrowing of the differential between the growth rates is likely to lead to a narrowing of [difference in] the performance." The rapid earnings growth seen in large caps over the past 18 months is expected to slow, while earnings are expected to pick up for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500. BofA's equity strategy team, led by Savita Subramanian, issued a 6,666 year-end target for the S&P 500 in 2025 that includes a call for a broadening of earnings driven in part by AI. "AI is definitely playing a role in 2025 earnings," Subramanian told Yahoo Finance. "And in fact, one of the reasons that we're bullish on the broadening out of earnings is the idea that instead of everybody spending on tech capex, tech capex is actually picking up, and tech companies are sort of spending on a broader array of industries." To Subramanian's point, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta alone are expected to have increased capital expenditures by 42% in 2024 and another 17% in 2025, pushing their total spend next year to $244 billion. Not all of this spending is on AI chips. Tech companies are also ramping up spending to pay for the power required to run AI data centers. During a 2025 outlook roundtable with reporters, BlackRock's Investment Institute pointed out that the power required to operate one data center is about equal to the average amount of power used in a day by all of New York City. This has strategists, including BofA's Subramanian, bullish on the companies exposed to that part of the technology buildout, including the Utilities sector (XLU), which is already up more than 20% in 2024, partially driven by AI optimism. This part of the AI trade has already begun to shift. In his 2025 equity outlook, Kostin highlighted a basket of three potential AI trades, noting that the transition from "phase 1" stocks like Nvidia to "phase 2" stocks in Goldman's AI "infrastructure" bucket is already well underway. As seen in the dark blue line in the chart below, AI infrastructure stocks, which include other semiconductor companies like Arm Holdings (ARM) and utility power plays like Vistra Corp (VST), have already seen large rallies. In the year ahead, Goldman thinks the changing of the AI guard will further take hold as the trade moves to "phase 3" under a basket of stocks Goldman has dubbed "enabled revenues." These are a group of companies that will benefit from the rollout and monetization of AI solutions. In other words, those that can use AI to drive sales but aren't actually selling things like AI chips to other companies. A large portion of this basket of stocks that Goldman is tracking are software and services stocks, including names like Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM), and Adobe (ADBE). And as seen in the sharp move higher in the lighter blue line in the graph below, "phase 3" AI stocks are already catching a bid. For example, Salesforce shares recently added more than 10% after reporting earnings and citing the success of its new AI tool, Agentforce. Goldman added that this isn't necessarily a call for AI infrastructure stocks to underperform the market in 2025 but rather to point out which portions of the AI trade could have more upside. Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon agreed. As the AI trade enters its next phase, "there should be more focus, or an increasing amount of focus, on the adopters versus the creators," Gordon told Yahoo Finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire D.E. Shaw. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks. Equity market pricing is never perfect due to supply and demand imbalances, emotional reactions, and errors. Billionaire investor David Elliot Shaw excels at detecting and exploiting these inefficiencies to generate shareholder value. Unlike most hedge fund managers who rely on intuition, Shaw uses sophisticated mathematical models and algorithms for investment decisions. Over the years, he has developed software and hardware to gain an edge in investment opportunities. Born in 1951, David E. Shaw became a successful billionaire scientist and hedge fund manager. After earning a PhD from Stanford in 1980, he founded D.E. Shaw & Co. in 1988 with six employees and $28 million in capital. The hedge fund has averaged a 12.5% return since inception, with only one down year. Shaw's firm uses powerful computers and advanced algorithms for quick market responses and risk management, returning over $51 billion to investors. Likewise, it generated a net return of 11.88% between 2001 and 2011. While Shaw’s firm was down by 9% at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, it bounced back to profitability with a 21% return in 2009. READ ALSO: 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire David Einhorn and Billionaire Paul Singer’s Top 12 Long-Term Stock Picks. D.E. Shaw is expanding and launching new funds. In 2023, they raised money for D.E. Shaw Alkali Fund VI, the newest in their Alkali group. By November 2024, they had secured $1 billion for this fund, focusing on corporate debt, structured credit, and synthetic securitizations. Last year, the firm also raised $1.1 billion for two new private investment vehicles: D.E. Shaw Voltaic Fund and D.E. Shaw Diopter Fund. In June 2024, D.E. Shaw announced it was raising its second fund in 16 months to target bank capital deals. They filed a private placement notice for D.E. Shaw Diopter Fund II, but the amount wasn't disclosed. Bloomberg reported that D.E. Shaw's largest hedge fund, the D.E. Shaw Composite Fund, gained 9.6% in 2023, outperforming the HFR Global Hedge Fund Index, which was up about 2.5% through December 15. Reuters added that D.E. Shaw's macro-oriented fund, the Oculus Fund, gained 7.8% in 2023, beating its macroeconomic peers. According to Bloomberg, the Oculus Fund has never had a negative year since it started. Diversification is another vital arsenal that D.E. Shaw & Co. relies on to spread risk and reduce market volatility. The firm is highly diversified with a portfolio value of about $116.49 billion. While technology stocks account for the most significant share in the equity market at 24.6%, the hedge fund also has stakes in Services at 17.5% and the financial sector at 7.7%. In addition to diversifying holdings, Shaw relies on a multi-strategy approach to squeeze optimum value in the market. Billionaire D.E. Shaw suggests investing in resilient companies, even as the US Federal Reserve signals fewer interest rate cuts in 2025. Despite three cuts reducing the benchmark rate to 4.25%-4.5%, economic slowdown concerns persist, especially in the labor market. Job growth is mainly in government and health care, while growth in manufacturing, business, and professional services has stagnated. Our Methodology To make the list of best stocks to buy according to billionaire D.E. Shaw, we scanned D.E. Shaw & Co investment portfolio. We then settled on the hedge fund’s largest holdings analyzing why they stand out and the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in them. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on D.E. Shaw & Co stake value. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. D.E. Shaw & Co’s Stake Value: $976.47 Million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a communications services company that provides applications that allow people to connect and share with friends and family. It is one of the best stocks to buy, according to billionaire D.E. Shaw, owing to its dominance in social media advertising. The company is increasingly investing in artificial intelligence as it looks to enhance user experience in its apps and engagement levels to attract more advertising campaigns. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is up by more than 73% in 2024, demonstrating strong financial performance over the year. Its outstanding 23% year-over-year revenue growth has outpaced the digital advertising industry. Likewise, the company boasts an exceptional gross margin of 81.5%, allowing it to generate more earnings and, therefore, higher shareholder value. While the global digital advertising market is poised to exceed $1.15 trillion by 2030, Meta Platforms is making the most in the fast-growing sector. The company is investing more in artificial intelligence tools to drive returns for advertisers and, therefore, attract more dollars in ad campaigns. Advertisers have seen an 8% increase in the quality of ads they can produce when they use Meta's Andromeda machine learning (ML) tool. The social networking giant also notes that returns on investment have increased by 22% as a result of advertisers using its Advantage+ tool, which uses AI to help them target audiences. Because of this, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has a good chance of continuing to grow faster than the digital ad market for a very long time. Hardman Johnston Global Equity stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “During the quarter, we initiated one new position in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and had no liquidations. Management at Meta has effectively addressed concerns about investment efficiency by shifting resources from Reality Labs towards broader AI initiatives with a clearer path to profitability. We believe management has successfully articulated the benefits of this strategy, highlighting how AI is driving user engagement and advertiser productivity. This, in turn, fuels continued revenue momentum and increases the likelihood of positive earnings surprises in the future. Additionally, the parent company of the social media platform, Facebook, has recently taken positive steps to enhance safety, which suggests to us a shift towards a more proactive and responsive approach to addressing important potential challenges and concerns. Weak oversight over data privacy protection was a key reason why we sold the position in the portfolio back in 2021. Removing this governance overhang allows us to feel comfortable to enter back into the stock at a time when we believe it is poised for strong earnings growth going forward.” Overall META ranks 4th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Billionaire D. E. Shaw. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks opened on a downbeat note as Wall Street slogged to the finish of a largely triumphant year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 2.2% Friday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gave up 1%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hovered near seven-month highs around 4.6%. After stacking impressive gains this year, some of the biggest names in tech are losing ground as investors take profits, rebalance their portfolios, or reassess their lofty valuations. Tesla (TSLA) on Friday lost more than 4%. Nvidia (NVDA) gave up 3%, while Amazon (AMZN) decreased by 2.5%. Wall Street has just three trading days remaining in a 2024 full of big gains, but markets have been unable to mount a "Santa Claus" rally into the end of the year. Markets have largely digested the year's remaining key economic data points, and investors are now turning their attention to two big themes for the coming year: the Federal Reserve's path for interest rates and the implications of Donald Trump's ascent back to the White House. On the former, stocks have largely taken in stride the Fed's plans to scale back rate cuts next year after an initial plunge last week. Bets have now shifted squarely to May as the next meeting at which the Fed will slash interest rates, as it continues to grapple with stubborn inflation while keeping a close eye on a cooling labor market. And on the latter, Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul writes that while Trump talked up his big plans during the campaign, especially on the economy, those plans could soon face a reality check from other key power players. The US government long had the nation’s biggest tech giants in its sights, and in 2024, it hit bull's-eye. The big victory came in August when the Justice Department convinced a federal district court judge that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) had abused its search engine dominance and violated antitrust law. What transpired in 2024 could have future implications for some of the other big names in the tech world, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are all defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims. For now, Wall Street doesn't appear rattled. The so-called Magnificent Seven stocks of the world's largest technology companies helped push the market higher in 2024, thanks partly to advancements around artificial intelligence. But the incoming Trump administration adds another layer of uncertainty to the next chapter of Big Tech antitrust enforcement.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost about 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.3% Friday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.3%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hovered near seven-month highs around 4.6%. Wall Street has just three trading days remaining in a 2024 full of big gains and is hoping to resume a "Santa Claus" rally into the end of the year. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up more than 26% on the year, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is up over 30%. The blue-chip Dow (^DJI) has risen a more modest 14%. Airline stocks soared in 2024. The S&P Supercomposite Airlines Index has climbed 60% for the year — its biggest yearly gain in a decade, Bloomberg reports. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has risen roughly 27% over that time frame. While major airlines Delta (DAL), United (UAL), Alaska (ALK), and JetBlue (JBLU) were all down slightly Thursday, they are set to post yearly gains far ahead of their S&P 500 peers. United Airlines is the best performer of the group — its stock soared 144% in 2024. Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group shares are up nearly 72% for the year. Delta Air Lines rose 55% in that timeframe, and JetBlue climbed 41%. American Airlines' (AAL) performance was in line with its peers, while Southwest Airlines' (LUV) 18% gain for the year fell behind. At the same time, Spirit Airlines (SAVEQ) plummeted as it struggled to stay afloat post-bankruptcy.

Title: Dutch Bros Inc. (BROS): A Bear Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bearish thesis on Dutch Bros Inc. (NYSE:BROS) on wallstreetbets Subreddit Page by Impressive_Safety_26. In this article, we will summarize the bears’ thesis on BROS. Dutch Bros Inc. (NYSE:BROS)'s share was trading at $55.82 as of Dec 26th. BROS’s trailing and forward P/E were 186.07 and 104.17 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A cup of the company's signature coffee being brewed in a state-of-the-art espresso machine. Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) has been expanding rapidly since its inception in 2017, growing from a single location in a small Colorado college town to a notable presence across the state. However, despite its outward growth, the company faces significant challenges that could hinder its future success. The long lines, intense competition with Starbucks and Dunkin', and the growing focus on healthy, less indulgent options all point to issues that may harm Dutch Bros' ability to maintain its edge in the coffee industry. The shift in its brand image, from vibrant, energetic service to more eclectic and diverse employees, has alienated some customers, leading to a diminished in-store experience that used to appeal to coffee drinkers seeking a fun, carefree environment. Dutch Bros’ core customers are not interested in calorie counts or protein-infused coffees. They want sugary, indulgent drinks, and recent shifts toward health-conscious options could alienate this loyal base, potentially leading to a loss in sales. Moreover, the company is attempting to take on bigger, more established players like Starbucks, Dunkin', and independent cafes, which are already entrenched in prime real estate locations. While Dutch Bros is targeting an ambitious expansion plan of 1,500 stores over the next decade, the costs associated with each new location—up to $1 million—are substantial, and the company’s average check size may not be sufficient to support this growth, especially when compared to Starbucks' robust global infrastructure. In addition to the financial burden of expansion, Dutch Bros is shifting from its iconic drive-thru huts to larger stores with indoor and outdoor seating. This move introduces higher overhead costs, which could reduce profit margins. The company may struggle to find prime locations in major urban centers where Starbucks already dominates, and as customers move inside, they may reconsider their purchases or even opt to make coffee at home, further weakening sales. Dutch Bros' financial performance has also been concerning, with a net loss of $16 million reported last quarter while expanding. This, coupled with a low operating margin, presents a bleak financial picture, despite the high expectations reflected in the company’s sky-high P/S ratio. The new CEO, Christine Barone, may have impressive credentials, but her focus on McDonald’s over Dutch Bros raises questions about her vision for the company. Though Barone has the potential to steer Dutch Bros in the right direction, the company faces an uphill battle to compete with established industry giants. Dutch Bros' growth potential may be overstated, and its current market valuation may be inflated, with limited prospects for sustained profitability unless it can radically adjust its strategy and manage its costs more effectively. For investors, Dutch Bros might be a high-risk gamble in a competitive and expensive industry. Dutch Bros Inc. (NYSE:BROS) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 37 hedge fund portfolios held BROS at the end of the third quarter which was 37 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of BROS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

With the Zacks Automotive- Replacement Parts industry currently placed in the top 12% of around 250 Zacks industries, stocks like DORM and SMP are worth considering. BROS has been benefiting from strategic innovations, effective marketing and a well-executed real estate strategy.

As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google's employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company's workforce. "We've noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce," one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. "How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company's success?" The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. "Despite the company's stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases" another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company's vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday's close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai's vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai's standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google's grip on U.S. search. The company's share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had "offended our users and shown bias," according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. "We definitely messed up on the image generation," Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. "It was mostly due to just not thorough testing." The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google's traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked "How many rocks should I eat each day," the tool said, "According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day." AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren't hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview's launch shouldn't discourage them from taking risks. "We should act with urgency," Reid said. "When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won't always find everything and that just means that we respond." Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ's request represents the agency's most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won't have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company's AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple's AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company's cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company's Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. "Google does not have one single visionary leader," a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. "Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed." In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan's and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of "chief scientist," but internally, he is now listed as an "IC," or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai's leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should've happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google's scrappy roots. He's flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google's Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company's hit AI products in 2024. After Brin's hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google's position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they've seen Brin walking around the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they're pursuing. Despite Brin's reemergence, several employees told CNBC they're doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn't strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it's hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company's AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco's waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of "Wicked" actors, where one, labeled "execs" looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled "Gemini" while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as "users." A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. "Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company's future, and are proud to work here," the spokesperson said. A few employees say they're no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google's CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more "cost efficiencies" across the company in order to invest more in AI. "I think any organization can always push a little further and I'll be looking at additional opportunities," Ashkenazi said. That month, Google posted a job listing for a "Central Reorg Support Team Partner." The responsibilities of that fixed-term contract position would include consulting with local HR teams and noted the need for the support staff's "ability to operate with empathy and diffuse/de-escalate challenging conversations/situations." "Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do," one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. "Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people," another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down. Touting its AI technology to clients, Pichai's leadership team has been aggressively pursuing federal government contracts, which has caused a heightened strain in some areas within the outspoken workforce since the beginning of the year. Google terminated more than 50 employees after a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon that provides the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Executives repeatedly said the contract didn't violate any of the company's "AI principles." However, documents and reports show the company's agreement allowed for giving Israel AI tools that included image categorization, object tracking, as well as provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. Earlier this month, a New York Times report found that four months prior to signing on to Nimbus, officials at the company worried that signing the deal would harm its reputation and that "Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations." In an all-hands meeting in April, a highly rated question asked why employees who did not participate in the protests were also fired, which was reported and cited in a National Labor Relations Board complaint from affected employees. Chris Rackow, Google's security chief, took the stage at the all-hands and rebutted those claims. "This was a very clear case of employees disrupting and occupying work spaces, and making other employees feel unsafe," a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the company "carefully confirmed" that every person terminated was involved in the protests. "By any standard, their behavior was completely unacceptable." That round of job eliminations underscored Google's clampdown on internal discussions related to hot-button topics, including politics and geopolitical conflicts, which was encouraged by executives several years prior. One internal meme that got more than 2,000 likes, compared Google to Star Wars' Anakin Skywalker. The meme shows an image of a smiling childhood Skywalker, framed by one of the company's original, colorful employee badges. The meme progresses Skywalker's age in two later versions of the badge. The final badge shows Darth Vader working for "Google," spelled out in the font of IBM's logo. WATCH: Google's fate hinges on this man: Demis Hassabis Got a confidential news tip?

As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google's employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company's workforce. "We've noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce," one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. "How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company's success?" The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. "Despite the company's stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases" another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company's vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday's close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai's vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai's standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google's grip on U.S. search. The company's share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had "offended our users and shown bias," according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. "We definitely messed up on the image generation," Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. "It was mostly due to just not thorough testing." The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google's traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked "How many rocks should I eat each day," the tool said, "According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day." AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren't hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview's launch shouldn't discourage them from taking risks. "We should act with urgency," Reid said. "When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won't always find everything and that just means that we respond." Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ's request represents the agency's most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won't have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company's AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple's AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company's cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company's Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. "Google does not have one single visionary leader," a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. "Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed." In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan's and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of "chief scientist," but internally, he is now listed as an "IC," or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai's leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should've happened sooner.

Title: Wall St Minting Easy Money From Risky Loans. What Could Go Wrong?

In the fall of 2015, in the back booth of the retro Putnam Restaurant in Greenwich, Conn., Craig Packer, a partner at Goldman Sachs, sat across from Doug Ostrover and listened to an audacious pitch. Mr. Ostrover, then 52, had recently left the investment colossus Blackstone and was mulling a dramatic midcareer effort to build a firm from scratch, one that would take on some of the biggest names in global finance. Quit your job, the billionaire financier told the 48-year-old Mr. Packer, and join me. As Mr. Packer later recalled, Mr. Ostrover wanted to create a firm that would lend money to highly indebted, risky businesses willing to pay hefty interest rates for fast cash. If it succeeded, the new enterprise, and its founding partners, could dominate a new financial playing field with the potential for huge profits. Mr. Ostrover’s pitch (one he would also make to Marc Lipschultz, a two-decade veteran of KKR who would eventually become another founder of the nascent firm) was to leap into the business of “private credit,” a simple-sounding term that belies its complexity — and its risk. The new venture would not be a bank, but would operate almost like one — without the regulatory restrictions and government oversight that had made traditional banks skittish about this market. Unlike a bank, the firm would be amassing money not from individual depositors, whose savings are fiercely protected by the federal government and can be withdrawn at will, but from institutions like insurance companies and pension funds. Thus, the new firm would be legally permitted to finance tricky, highly speculative companies without reporting the details of such activities publicly. During the next several months, over scrambled eggs at the diner and meetings elsewhere, Mr. Ostrover, Mr. Packer and Mr. Lipschultz agreed that the venture offered them a great opportunity — but only if they started at a gigantic scale, $10 billion or so. A bet that size would be a game-changing move in the world of private credit, where small, shady lending shops did backroom financing deals for even shadier fledgling companies. Eventually, the three men raised $12 billion, undercutting their would-be competitors by promising big pension funds and others, like the investment fund run by George Soros, low investment fees if they backed the new firm. Large investors — including Brown University’s endowments, New Jersey’s pension fund, Michael Dell’s investment firm and Iconiq Capital — were given stakes in the firm, essentially making them owners of the new enterprise. “They wanted to become one of the largest financial players on the planet,” said Oliver Weisberg, chief executive of Blue Pool Capital, which led that initial financing round. “That was always their plan.” Over the next few years, the new firm set off a high-stakes arms race among some of the biggest names in global finance. Interest rates had been low since the 2007-8 financial crisis, so pension funds and other institutional investors were desperate to find ways to earn higher returns on their investments. The debt markets, Mr. Ostrover told prospective clients, were much more stable, year over year, than stocks or commodities. And the firm, then called Owl Rock Capital, took the unusual step of setting itself up with so-called permanent investor capital that it would hold even longer than a typical private equity fund, where investors tie up money for a few years or even a decade. This would allow it to make increasingly long-term loans. In return, clients were offered the prospect of far higher returns than they could earn with more conventional investments. “Doug could talk a dog off a meat truck,” said David Salomon, an investment adviser who agreed to help stake the new venture after meeting with Mr. Ostrover over beers at a strip-mall Chinese restaurant. The firm’s founders had “a great vision,” said Mr. Salomon, who manages money for endowments, pensions and family offices through his firm, East End Advisors. Nearly a decade after its founding, Blue Owl Capital — as the firm was renamed — is succeeding in ways that might have seemed unimaginable in that cramped Connecticut diner booth. The firm, which went public in 2021 through a merger and employs more than 1,000 people, is one of the biggest private lenders on Wall Street, managing more than $235 billion of investors’ money. Blue Owl has both caught and created a once-in-a-generation wave, one that has brought a sweeping change to Wall Street. Over the past few years, roughly $1.8 trillion has been raised by private credit investment firms, including rivals like Ares and Apollo Global. That money has been lent to highly indebted companies in sectors like software, insurance and health care. “We’re financing many of the same companies that used to go to the public markets,” Mr. Packer said. To doubters, he added: “Ignore us at your peril.” Looking in from the outside are major banks like Goldman and JPMorgan Chase, whose executives now worry they are ceding their lucrative franchises of big-ticket financing to these less regulated rivals. At a closed-door Goldman management committee meeting this summer, the top brass debated a hard truth: The investment bank was increasingly falling behind in private credit, namely in arranging big-ticket loans for corporations, part of its bread-and-butter financing work, because the newcomers were willing to give out the money at easier terms — for example, by accepting less protection against defaults. “The more risk you take, the better you look,” Marc Nachmann, Goldman’s global head of asset and wealth management, advised the group. Still, the partners decided that they couldn’t ignore the frenzy; Goldman would continue to organize, for a fee, investment funds in which its clients can lend money alongside and in competition with private credit firms. Other big players are also moving in. This month, BlackRock, a publicly traded asset manager and one of the biggest names on Wall Street, staked its claim with a deal to buy the private credit upstart HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion. In its announcement, BlackRock predicted that the private credit market would more than double to $4.5 trillion by 2030. Already the success of Blue Owl has brought mammoth riches to its founders. Mr. Lipschultz and Mr. Ostrover — both cited as billionaires by Forbes — recently bought a majority stake in the Tampa Bay Lightning in a deal that valued the National Hockey League team at nearly $1.8 billion. (Mr. Packer is also an investor in the team.) And the origin story of the firm has become part of local lore. In Greenwich, a gold plaque that was recently installed at the Putnam Restaurant read: “The booth that launched a $25 billion company.” The sign is already out of date. Blue Owl’s public arm, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “OWL,” was recently valued at $35 billion. It can be a risky business, making loans to risky businesses. Consider the go-go junk bond era of the 1980s, as captured in books like “Den of Thieves” and “The Predators’ Ball.” Famously, Michael R. Milken’s Drexel Burnham Lambert organized loans for companies like Steve Wynn’s casinos, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp and the ultimately doomed cable operator MCI Communications. These bonds helped fuel the era of corporate raiders and became the backbone of the private equity industry, which used the debt to buy public companies, take them private and borrow more money again. This worked until it didn’t. Mr. Milken went to jail for violating federal securities laws, Drexel went belly up, and some of the companies financed with junk bonds eventually declared bankruptcy. By the mid-2000s, Wall Street bankers had found yet another way to expand access to credit and rake in billions through risky lending, this time with mortgages to borrowers with low credit scores. Bankers pooled mortgages from borrowers with a mix of high and low credit scores but financed the group as a whole as if they were all highly rated. This fueled a rapid increase in mortgages, inflating home prices. The subprime mortgage bubble eventually burst in 2007 and 2008, leading to a global financial crisis. To its detractors, private credit carries some of those same red flags. Officials at the International Monetary Fund (“could become a systematic risk”), at the Federal Reserve (“financial stability implications”) and on the Senate banking committee (“may pose hidden dangers”) have all chimed in with warnings. Regulators have raised a number of potential issues. Chief among them is that the industry’s rapid growth has not been tested in a long market downturn — a financial crisis or a prolonged recession. It’s unclear how the companies they lend to would fare in a weak economy. Even making a guess about what would happen, critics say, is difficult because of the opaqueness of the industry. While banks are required to publicly report the value of their loans, private credit firms are not. There is also the specter of contagion. Since so many private credit funds are backed by public pensions and other such entities, losses to the industry would ultimately be borne by millions of retirees. The hundreds of billions of dollars that Blue Owl manages include the pension funds of teachers in New York State, Texas and California. In New Jersey and South Carolina, Blue Owl invests on behalf of firefighters and other state employees. Private credit’s boosters say their lending portfolios are well diversified and unlikely to sour all at once, and they rightly point out that everything thus far has gone smoothly. They say they report the health of their loans to their private investors, who have the right to examine their obligations in detail — and do. As measured by the relative interest rates charged by this new class of lenders, there has been a paradigm shift. Banks and private lenders charge higher rates to risky borrowers, expressed as the “spread” or difference from the interest rate on U.S. Treasury bonds, generally considered the safest base-line investment. The larger the spread, the riskier the loan, or so goes the calculus. With so many new private credit firms competing to make loans, the average spread on such loans and high-yield bonds has shrunk drastically in the past two years. That perplexes longtime industry researchers such as Ed Altman, a professor emeritus at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “The markets are not risk-free,” Mr. Altman said. Perhaps most prominently, JPMorgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has emerged as a vocal critic of private credit. Last December, Mr. Dimon appeared before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and urged the senators to do something about the unregulated and swift growth of private credit. Regulators, he said, will be “unable to see the next brewing crisis,” because so much activity has moved outside the banking system. If these private loans run into trouble, he said, lenders will be unlikely to refinance them, as banks do. Over the past year, private credit has become almost an obsession for Mr. Dimon, who has repeated those warnings on JPMorgan’s earnings calls, in meetings with clients and in television interviews with CNBC and Bloomberg. In May, he told Wall Street analysts that there would be “hell to pay” if a large number of these loans turned sour. Mr. Dimon is not a disinterested party, of course. By making huge loans with their own money, firms like Blue Owl have been encroaching on JPMorgan’s business of arranging loans of $1 billion or more to companies and private-equity firms. To claw back at least part of this market, JPMorgan has also been hunting for a private credit shop to buy. By mid-2024, JPMorgan nearly completed a deal to acquire Monroe Capital, a Chicago-based private lender, according to a person with knowledge of those negotiations. The deal faltered, however, when the two parties couldn’t agree on certain terms. In the meantime, JPMorgan has set aside around $10 billion of its own money — a pittance for the bank — to compete with the likes of Blue Owl on private credit deals. So while Mr. Dimon may think private credit is dangerous, he still wants in. While Blue Owl frequently promotes its track record — saying it has lost money on only a handful of deals it has financed over the past decade — that performance has been tested by strife between the lender and its partners in at least one major deal. In 2021, Blue Owl and a consortium extended a $1.7 billion loan to Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm, to buy Pluralsight, which makes educational and training videos for large technology companies. Rather than weigh the start-up’s profits, they based the loan on Pluralsight’s revenues and the projection for its growth. But Pluralsight’s customers, which included Deutsche Bank, Teach for America and 1-800 Contacts, soon began to bail. They became frustrated with Pluralsight’s course offerings and customer support. The company’s revenues plummeted. In July this year, the Blue Owl-led group allowed Vista to defer its quarterly payments on its debt. Vista tried to push lenders to cut its debt load and allow it to retain control of the company. Instead, by August, Blue Owl and its other lenders had become Pluralsight’s new owners. Vista lost billions on the deal, and the lending group, as of now, has lost roughly half of that $1.7 billion loan. (Blue Owl put $339 million into the original deal.) Blue Owl said Pluralsight was one of just six companies it had lost money on, out of more than 500 it had lent to over the last eight years. But many on Wall Street question whether Blue Owl and its peers’ loan numbers are too good to be true. Blue Owl says its loss rate is 0.1 percent. While that can’t be independently confirmed, it’s remarkably low even for a safe debt investment portfolio, let alone one like Blue Owl’s, which is made up of loans to companies that are considered generally poorer bets than those that qualify for investment-grade ratings. In an interview, Mr. Lipschultz said the firm’s portfolio was generally uncorrelated, arguing that it is unlikely to sour all at once. He summed up the business airily: “We’re the banks of old.” Because private credit firms don’t have to regularly reveal their loans to regulators, they can create their own rules for how to “mark,” or value, their portfolios. These loans, said Thomas Majewski, founder of Eagle Point Credit and a three-decade veteran of the lending industry, “are sometimes less rigorously marked” than they would be at regulated banks. Blue Owl charges its investing clients an annual fee based on the value of its portfolio of loans. So the higher the value, the more it makes. Blue Owl says that it uses third-party evaluators to mark portfolios, and that the independent board members sign off. Even Blue Owl says defaults are likely to rise if the economy enters a recession. Still, the firm said that even if a number of its deals ran into trouble, it was different from the banks that once financed these deals. “We don’t have depositors,” Mr. Lipschultz said. “We don’t have anybody who says, ‘OK, I need my money back today.’” Blue Owl’s founders insist that if any more of their companies run into trouble, the long-term commitments their investors have made give them the time and the flexibility to work through those issues. How long can the boom in private credit last? Practically everyone on Wall Street concedes that this “golden moment” — as Jonathan Gray, president of Blackstone, once put it — is bound to dim as more lenders emerge to compete with one another for a finite number of loans. The question is whether it will cause a shakeout that could spill into the broader economy, with dire consequences. Few influential voices in the financial world seem to have any immediate concerns. In a speech to the Brookings Institution in May, the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook said: “Overall, I think the growth of private credit likely has not materially adversely affected the financial system’s resilience. Private credit funds appear well positioned to hold the riskiest parts of corporate lending.” Later that month, the Fed’s chair, Jerome H. Powell, commented that, in private credit, “many of the lending structures are not subject to a run in the way that banks have traditionally been.” He added that because their funding largely came from backers with a long-term commitment, “it’s not obvious to me that at this point it’s a net loss to financial stability.” But regulators are increasingly on edge. In November last year, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the chairman of the banking committee, wrote to regulators that “private credit funds operate in the shadows” and “in the absence of sufficient oversight and accountability.” The International Monetary Fund stated in April that the sector “has meaningful vulnerabilities, is opaque to stakeholders and is growing rapidly under limited prudential oversight.” “It’s crazy,” said Philipp Krohn, chief executive of Alantra US, an investment bank. “Every time we look, they are getting bigger.” Failures could have a cascading effect throughout the financial markets. Because private credit firms borrow from banks — JPMorgan lends to Blue Owl, for instance — “there is actually an umbilical cord back to the banking system,” said Viral V. Acharya, a New York University finance professor and former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Blue Owl’s war chest is roughly doubled by leverage, meaning that for every dollar its clients have staked the firm directly, two dollars are lent out. Mr. Acharya compared the seeming steadiness of the booming industry now to “saying the market is great to lend in the U.S. in 2007 and 2008.” He added, “Because the cycle hasn’t turned yet, we simply do not know.” Mr. Lipschultz said he wasn’t worried about that. With a muted laugh, he pointed out that the government needed to rescue major banks in 2008 — and that his firm continued lending even at the nadir of the pandemic. “Where have the problems been since the financial crisis?” Mr. Lipschultz asked and quickly answered his own question: “The banks.” The post Wall St. Is Minting Easy Money From Risky Loans.

Ruslan Desyatnikov is Founder and CEO of QA Mentor, Inc., an independent software-testing company headquartered in New York. As the tech sector faces unprecedented upheaval and widespread layoffs, the QA industry is feeling the impact, grappling with new uncertainties. This shifting landscape presents significant challenges that demand our attention. It’s time to confront how these changes are reshaping the world of quality assurance and what it means for professionals in the field. From 2022 to 2023, major tech firms carried out significant job layoffs. Amazon let go of 27,000 workers, Meta dismissed 21,000 and Microsoft laid off 10,000. These figures have only grown as we moved into 2024, as over 500 tech companies have made job cuts, resulting in over 100,000 employees losing their jobs since the start of this year. This is a world away from 2020-2021, when the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation that led to heightened demand for tech products and services, such as remote work tools, e-commerce platforms and digital entertainment. During this period, tech companies saw stock prices soar on investor optimism in a pandemic-changed world. Global central banks kept interest rates low to aid economic recovery, allowing tech firms affordable borrowing for growth. Government stimulus and aid bolstered businesses, including tech, amid pandemic uncertainties. As the global economy faced renewed challenges around 2022, including rising inflation and interest rates, tech giants shifted gears from their aggressive hiring stance of 2020-2021. Now, they're cutting back on hiring and implementing layoffs to ensure financial stability post-pandemic. This abrupt change is reshaping employees' career trajectories from optimism to uncertainty almost overnight. In this industry upheaval, the QA sector must seize the opportunity to leverage automation and AI to stay competitive. As AI testing solutions advance, QA professionals need AI tools to remain marketable. By integrating AI, companies can: • Optimize efficiency with AI. AI-driven tools quickly spot patterns and anomalies often missed by traditional methods, streamlining testing, cutting manual work and boosting productivity. AI also prioritizes test cases based on data, ensuring focus on critical areas. • Control costs through predictive AI. AI reduces manual labor by predicting defects early, minimizing rework and errors. AI-driven resource management enhances efficiency and keeps budgets lean. • Enhance human resource allocation. With routine tasks automated, QA teams can tackle complex challenges and innovation. AI augments human expertise, allowing teams to focus on strategic initiatives and elevate service delivery. • Develop new AI-driven services. Adopting AI enables companies to create new testing services tailored to evolving market needs. AI offers the scalability and adaptability needed to stay ahead with innovative solutions. • Modernize workflows using AI. AI accelerates test execution by auto-generating cases and scripts, improving accuracy and ensuring consistent, reliable results across environments. • Strengthen risk management. AI-powered testing tools help identify potential risks early in the process, offering predictive insights that reduce the likelihood of critical failures. This proactive approach helps ensure higher-quality releases and mitigates costly issues in production. To effectively address the challenges facing the QA industry, companies must adopt a comprehensive approach that includes targeted employee training and upskilling. Here are some concrete steps to enhance your QA team's capabilities: • Implement continuous learning programs. Focus on advanced testing frameworks such as Selenium, Appium and JUnit to ensure QA engineers are proficient in the latest tools and methodologies. • Equip teams with knowledge. Provide training in areas like API testing, security testing and performance testing using tools like Postman, OWASP ZAP and Apache JMeter. • Foster expertise in test automation scripts. Encourage the use of languages like Python, Java and JavaScript to keep teams agile and adept at handling evolving testing requirements. • Provide certifications in cloud-based testing platforms. Offer certifications for tools such as AWS Device Farm or Sauce Labs to prepare QA professionals for future testing in cloud environments. • Incorporate hands-on workshops and real-world project simulations. Integrate these into training programs to significantly improve practical skills. • Invest in employee development. Provide access to industry conferences and webinars to keep teams updated on the latest trends and best practices in QA. In the context of present challenges, sticking to traditional methods is no longer sufficient. To stay competitive, companies must integrate data-driven insights into their quality assurance strategies. Here’s how to leverage data effectively: Begin by utilizing analytics tools to thoroughly analyze test results, track performance metrics and uncover patterns. This approach provides a clearer picture of where to direct your testing efforts and how to refine your processes. Predictive analytics can help you anticipate potential issues before they become critical, reducing the risk of defects in production. Optimizing resource allocation becomes more precise with data. By understanding workload and performance metrics, you can ensure that high-priority tasks receive the necessary focus and attention. Data insights also help refine test coverage strategies, revealing gaps and overlaps to ensure comprehensive and targeted testing. To foster continuous improvement, establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and regularly review metrics related to testing efficiency, defect rates and resolution times. This practice highlights areas for enhancement and validates the effectiveness of changes made. Cultivating a data-driven culture is essential. Equip your QA teams with the skills and tools to interpret data effectively, promoting a proactive approach to quality assurance and driving excellence in your testing processes. The tech sector’s massive layoffs have sent shockwaves through the QA industry, creating a climate of uncertainty and demanding urgent adaptation. Yet, within this upheaval lies a golden opportunity for QA teams to embrace AI, automation and data-driven strategies. By optimizing efficiency, controlling costs, modernizing workflows and upskilling employees, QA professionals can turn disruption into innovation. It's time for the industry to shed its old skin, rise above the chaos and redefine what quality assurance means in a post-pandemic world. The future belongs to those who can navigate the turbulence with agility and foresight. Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Car Repair Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) stands against the other car repair stocks. According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global automotive aftermarket industry was valued at $418.95 billion in 2023. The market is expected to reach $568.19 billion by 2032. The acceptance of electric and hybrid vehicles is expected to propel the growth in demand for related aftermarket products. Moreover, the rise in automotive e-commerce is also contributing to increased sales in the market. As a result, major players in the industry are developing their omnichannel platforms to facilitate online automotive aftermarket services. The KPMG Corporate Finance recently released its automotive aftermarket report for the fiscal third quarter of 2024. The report highlights that the decline in new car purchases can lead to growth for the aftermarket industry. Despite the recent cut in the Federal Reserve's interest rates, experts believe new car purchases may not see an immediate uptick. This is because auto loan interest rates typically adjust slowly, thereby remaining high even after the Fed's actions. Currently, average auto loan rates are still exceeding 9.61% for new vehicles and nearly 14% for used vehicles, which poses a significant barrier to new car purchases. As a result, many consumers are opting to defer vehicle purchases and are increasingly relying on the aftermarket for more affordable maintenance and repair solutions to extend the lifespan of their existing vehicles. Moreover, the gradual adoption of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and software-defined vehicles is reshaping the automotive aftermarket landscape. While these advancements may lead to less frequent maintenance needs, they also introduce new service requirements related to battery systems and advanced electronics. According to forecasts from Bank of America Global Research, BEVs are expected to comprise about 8% of total vehicle sales in 2024, increasing to approximately 29% by 2030. While analyzing the performance of the industry during the quarter, the report highlighted that the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) saw significant growth over the past year, up 34.4% and 26.6%, respectively. The Automotive Aftermarket Index grew at a slower pace of 14.3%. However, it is noteworthy that in Q3 2024, this index outperformed both major indices with a growth rate of 8.4%. Specific segments within the aftermarket showed varied performance. For instance, the Parts Suppliers grew by 13.1% while Retailers & Distributors grew by 8.9%. The Enthusiast Products segment rebounded with an 11.3% increase after earlier declines, whereas Service Providers experienced a slight decline of 3.2%. Regardless of the challenges stemming from high interest rates and inflation the automotive aftermarket has shown resilience and proved to be recession-proof. The shift towards maintaining older vehicles rather than purchasing new ones, combined with technological advancements in vehicle types is fueling growth in the industry. Moreover, trends suggest that while immediate growth in new car sales may be sluggish, there remains a robust demand for aftermarket services and products as consumers adapt to changing economic conditions. Our Methodology To curate the list of 8 best car repair stocks to invest in, we used the Finviz stock screener and other listings on the internet. Using our sources we aggregated a list of car repair stocks sorted by market capitalization. Next, we ranked these stocks by the number of hedge fund holders sourced from Insider Monkey’s third-quarter hedge funds database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An AutoNation-branded dealership, showcasing the wide variety of new and used vehicles on offer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) is a major automotive retailer in the United States. The company operates through a network of franchises that sell both new and used vehicles. The company deals in Domestic, Import, and Premium Luxury segments with franchises in each segment selling parts and offering repair services to customers. The company had a rough fiscal third quarter of 2024, characterized by a CDK outage, which is a major software used by various players in the industry. Its net revenue decreased 4% year-over-year to $6.6 billion, whereas the gross profit also dipped 9% during the same time. However, on the bright side AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) Customer Financial Services segment and After-Sales segment, led the gross profit 2% higher on a subsequent basis. Management noted that its After-Sales segment, which deals with parts and repairing services has been showing continuous momentum despite the CDK outage. While the overall revenue of the company dipped, the segment revenue improved by around 1% year-over-year. More importantly, the segment profit margins showed a 50 bps improvement during the same time led by improved parts and labor rates, leverage, and higher value orders. Looking ahead, management notified of improving technician headcount thereby further boosting productivity within the segment. It is one of the best car repair stocks to invest in now. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) (down 3.7%) operates around 350 dealer franchises across the US, as well as collision centres and used vehicle stores. When compared to Group 1, it sells more units at a slightly higher price and margin, and derives around 50% more revenue. But its strategy is different, with nationwide branding and centralised operations. Although we prefer the Group 1 model, the economics of Autonation look attractive to us. And by introducing this into the portfolio we could thereby invest more than 5% of assets in this sector without necessitating the sale of other attractive large positions. And so after selling a little Group 1 and buying Autonation we ended the quarter with 4.1% and 1.9% positions respectively.” Overall AN ranks 6th on our list of the car repair stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A customer smiling delightedly after driving away in their new car from the automotive retail shop. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30 Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) is an international automotive retailer based in the United States. The company primarily operates by selling vehicles and providing car parts and repairing services. Its Total Care Auto segment, powered by Landcar, is a significant component of its business model, specializing in service contracts and other vehicle protection products. The segment operates 37 collision repair centers in 14 states across the country. During the third quarter, Madison Mid Cap Fund announced adding Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) to its portfolio. The firm stated that while the company owns a diversified portfolio of dealerships, its Parts and Services business tends to earn more profits. The anticipation by Madison stood true as during the fiscal third quarter results delivered $4.2 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year. While the revenue growth was driven by a 16% increase in new vehicle sales and a 13% increase in used vehicle sales, both components reported 11% and 6% decreases in gross profits. On the other hand, its Parts and Services segment not only grew revenue by 13% but also improved gross profits by 16%. The segment provided damage control to the overall gross profit which decreased only 142 bps year-over-year. It is one of the best car repair stocks to invest in. Madison Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: "During the quarter we added three new holdings: Graco, Lithia Motors, and Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:ABG). We purchased shares in Lithia Motors and Asbury Automotive, two of the largest auto franchise dealer groups in the country, owning a diversified portfolio of dealerships ranging from Toyota to Ford to Mercedes. Investors tend to pay a lot of attention to the level of new car sales, but dealers actually earn more in profits from parts and service than they do from selling new cars, and this steady business provides a nice ballast throughout the economic cycle. In addition, we believe these businesses have a long runway to create value via consolidation of this fragmented industry, as the advantages of scale are increasing.” Overall ABG ranks 7th on our list of the car repair stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of ABG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Forecast 2025 — Taking Out the Trash

Note: due to the length of this special blog-post, email will probably truncate it. So, to view the entire post just go to: Kunstler.com on your browser. I would guess that you’re feeling as if anything might happen now. It’s hard to rule out even the possibility that we could all be vaporized before moving onto the next mundane chore of the day. The world order is dangerously in flux. America’s Woke-Jacobin “Joe Biden” regime was defeated in the 2024 election, but they were apparently just a front for the sinister entity we call the “blob” or the Deep State, which in recent years has consistently and garishly acted against our country’s interests. So, the blob abides, and it probably weaves schemes in the deep background of daily life even as a new government awaits. But if the Woke-Jacobin Biden-istas were tied-in with the so-called “globalist” enterprise centered around the EU bureaucracy, with assistance from the World Economic Forum’s network of zillionaires and bankers. . . well, that coalition looks rather broken now. It’s doing a hurt-dance. It’s on the run, a little bit. What is not broken for the moment — a tenuous moment — is the new Trump regime’s determination to correct the disorders of Western Civ, starting with the affairs of the USA, according to age-old reality-based norms of behavior and good-faith relations between the people and their government. Trust was broken and must be restored. The President-elect has assembled an extraordinary team of reformers, if they can get to their posts without subversion. And, of course, Mr. Trump himself has to evade further attempts to rub him out, to knock him off the game-board before he can take office, and then he must survive the months beyond his inauguration. So, you are correct to be nervous. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication. Subscribe to this blog on Patreon or right here on Substack! This blog is sponsored this week by Vaulted, an online mobile web app for investing in allocated and deliverable physical gold. To learn more visit: Vaulted.com Paradoxically, Mr. Trump has to initially manage the US government as if it deserves a sense of reassuring continuity, which, in many respects it does not deserve. So many institutions and relationships between them have been perverted and damaged. How do we pretend that the upper layers of management in any federal agency — the strata who really run things below the top “political” appointees — can continue in-place as if all that perversion never happened? The Department of Justice and the FBI are filled with lawyers and agents who abused their power egregiously and went to war against the American people. The agency’s work will just have to stop for a while. The nation can probably endure if investigations and prosecutions are suspended for sixty days while the personnel issues get sorted out — who goes and who stays. But what about the Defense Department and the CIA? The country must be able to defend itself. These departments are the lairs of the more dangerously entrenched blob actors. Both DOD and the CIA have come to be organized as racketeering operations. Both are involved in domestic money-laundering activities at the giant scale, and in rackets abroad — such as the many grifts around Ukraine, in which giant financial entities like BlackRock are partnered-in. (You know, for instance, don’t you, that BlackRock was poised to acquire control of Ukraine’s natural resource base, until Mr. Putin’s resolve ended that fantasy.) And the CIA is suspected of being deeply involved in the Mexican crime cartel operations, both around drugs and human trafficking. The imputations are sickening. The DOD and the CIA will fight desperately to preserve their perqs and projects, and to stay out of jail. But until now they have not really been challenged. The public health agencies, FDA, NIAID, CDC, NIH, and so on have become outright mafias, with labyrinths of money-laundering channels, government grant-grifting, and pharma phuckery, not least around the still-mysterious, homicidal Covid-19 prank, with the deadly mRNA vaccine program piggybacked onto it. Their nemesis, RFK, Jr., is coming on-board to oversee exactly what happened in these corrupt fiefdoms. If you have read his books about Dr. Anthony Fauci, you know that he is adequately prepared to discover what took US public health off-the-rails. Don’t forget, also, that the entire medical profession lies in a slough of dishonor for going along with the fake-and-deadly Covid-19 treatment protocols (intubation, remdesivir, midazolam, and morphine) that killed so many people needlessly. Plus, the doctors’ dishonest demonization of ivermectin and other viable treatments, plus the disgraceful, mendacious behavior of the medical journals in the whole filthy scam. Next, consider the rickety, cruel, Kafkaesque US health insurance system that is now all but running the doctors’ practices. It is an unholy mess. What can you do but wish Mr. Kennedy God-speed in beginning to unravel it all? Surely, a lot of people involved deserve to go to prison. For all you know, the heavyweights of blobdom might be plotting some sort of coup during the Holiday season to prevent Mr. Trump from taking power on January 20. Failure to mount a coup would actually signal some essential weakness in the blob’s own enterprise architecture. The blob has certainly tried everything so far up to an actual coup, that is, a sharp discontinuity in constitutional government — like, with tanks around the US Capitol and generals in the Oval Office. The blob’s other problem is that it has no powerful individual leader to rally behind, no one with charisma. It has only its multifarious tentacles — departments, agencies, offices, and operations — which Mr. Trump and his lieutenants can lop off in broad strokes. They can cashier generals, defund projects, shut-down offices and programs, send US Marshals into CIA headquarters in Langley, VA, to lockdown document archives while flushing out employees. Early on, the Trump team has got to assess the patriotism of individuals in these departments. Based on blob behavior of the past decade, no one’s fidelity to the constitution can be taken-for-granted. It will surely be necessary to begin open inquiries into the recent behavior of some prominent political figures in order to demonstrate a serious intent to reform. For just one example, Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security chief who threw the US Border wide open for four years, presents a probable cause case for treason. Perhaps the new Attorney General can convene a grand jury away from the blob-dominated DC federal court district, say in Texas where these crimes on the border were actually committed — crimes such as ordering the US Border Patrol to stand down while whole caravans waded the Rio Grande. Attorney General Merrick Garland needs to answer publicly for his coordination of a massive DOJ lawfare conspiracy. How exactly did Deputy US AG Matthew Colangelo end up in Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office? Who green-lighted the harsh prosecutions of Jan 6 suspects by Matthew Graves, in particular their long pre-trial detentions in solitary confinement? Who in the White House confabbed with attorney Nathan Wade to manage the Fulton County case against Mr. Trump and eighteen other defendants? Why did Delaware federal attorney David Weiss allow the statute of limitations run out on Hunter Biden’s 2014 and 2015 tax evasion cases? Stuff like that. And, of course, FBI Director Christopher Wray needs to answer for the Jan 6 DNC / RNC pipe bomb caper, and the roles of “confidential human sources” in the Jan 6 Capitol riot — including the antics of the notorious Ray Epps. Plus, the three years of RussiaGate and his cavalier use of the FISA Courts. Please subpoena SC District Judge James Boasberg on that, too, while you’re at it. It will not take many inquiries like these to get the point across. The point will be that after many years of absence, consequence is back on the table for those who abuse power. During the transition — Nov 6 to Jan 20 — Mr. Trump has equivocated a bit about his intentions to bring back consequence in federal operations. On one hand he claims he’s “not interested in retribution,” while on the other hand he has named appointees such as Kash Patel at FBI and John Ratcliffe at CIA who are intimately acquainted with the illegal activities in those places and on-the-record as eager to set consequence in motion. It’s hard to imagine they will demur from getting answers about what has been going on and who is responsible, and take corrective measures. If he makes it through confirmation, it may be less difficult for a Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to straighten out the Pentagon. The military is much more explicitly hierarchical, and orders are orders. Generals and bureaucrats will be ordered out of the building. But then there are large dark pools of activity hidden from the public, things like DARPA and its many offshoots, that may be harder to penetrate. You must imagine that there are operations hidden even from the SecDef. We keep hearing that the Pentagon can’t pass an audit and can’t account for trillions of mis-spent dollars. Guess what? Someone (or many someones) can be court-martialed for that. Again: consequence returns. Suddenly things are done correctly. Perhaps even a lost sense of honor is restored. The Fiscal Abyss Who knows what Elon & Vivek’s DOGE group can accomplish? But there are hard limits in the fiscal whoppers like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and veterans benefits that won’t yield much. Blogger David Stockman, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that even firing three-quarters of all federal employees would only save about $700 billion in savings, which is not enough to avoid a debt death spiral. The carried debt alone could sink whatever else Mr. Trump seeks to accomplish, especially as it can morph into a lethal currency crisis at any time — a runaway inflation and / or collapse of the bond market that would put a lot of people and enterprises out of business, bringing on a new great depression. There’s always talk about “growing” our way out of debt. I doubt we will be able to do that in the proposed way, based on economic dynamics we’ll get to further below. In his first term, Mr. Trump made noises about defaulting on US debt. I think you will hear chatter about doing just that in the early days of 2025. Though it sounds horrendous, default will happen one way or another: either an honest repudiation of treasury paper (Sorry, we just can’t make the payments anymore), or by allowing currency collapse to do the dirty work for us (Sorry, but our money is worthless. Here’s a billion dollars. . . enjoy the bagel you get for it). Much of the rest of the world is in similar straits debt-wise, especially Europe and China. The Bretton Woods system for regulating world money has been brain-dead for many years. It’s not hard to imagine something replacing it, including the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency (with all its exorbitant privileges). It remains to be seen what role, if any, cryptocurrencies might play in world trade. Many people are wowed by Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 lately. I’m still not persuaded that it’s anything but a classic bubble in a speculation that represents nothing — except maybe the electricity expended in processing the math attached to its “creation.” A blogger friend makes this interesting point: What will matter is that one Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to about a month of electricity for the average US household. As Bitcoin grows, energy “consumption” grows exponentially. Note, I said CONSUMPTION, NOT PRODUCTION. If you believe in infinite cheap energy fueled by infinite free money and debt, then all the power to you! No pun intended. . . . — Wendy Williamson For all the “wow,” Bitcoin still lacks the principal properties of true money. It’s not a practical medium of exchange (buying stuff), it’s not a useful store of value (with its periodic crashes and zooms), nor a reliable index of prices (ditto). To me, it looks like a fugazy that has made a small number of people very rich within a limited window of history. Naturally, the people who got rich, who converted their Bitcoins into villas, yachts, and shares of Nvidia, are infatuated with Bitcoin and the phenomenon of crypto. If there is one thing that might characterize the new times we are entering, it will be the recognition that real things have more value than fake things. We have been traumatized by fakery, and going forward great effort will go into identifying it. Our survival depends on being able to discern the fake from the real. Money and Economy Does the world really need a certified universal money agreement? Nothing like Bretton Woods existed until eighty years ago, and it came into being only because the USA so dominated the globe after a ruinous war in Europe and Asia it could command the world’s obedience — at least the parts that weren’t communist. Before that, currencies, monies, and commodities existed, of course, and people took calculated chances trading in them. Usually, but not always, one nation’s currency dominated for a while, as the pound sterling did before World War Two. But paper currencies are a relative novelty. The US only started using paper money in the 1860s. When “money” was mostly gold or silver coin, exchange rates were easy to determine by the purity and weight of a coin. When paper entered the scene, bankers, speculators, and merchants had to do their own due diligence to discover whether X-tons of iron ore, tons of coal, or wheat were worth trading for X-amount of yen, deutschmarks, pounds sterling, and dollars. Those quandaries birthed hedging in currency and commodity trades — a device now wildly perverted, deforming the dynamics of risk and price discovery in everything. We are probably headed back into that world of diverse monies with inherent risks, part and parcel with a multi-polar world of regional hegemons. The US dollar can no longer act as the universal collateral guaranteeing all transactions. Hence, the trade in debt, bonds, and borrowing re-acquires layers of risk absent for a long time. Government borrowing — issuance of sovereign bonds — necessarily declines in that milieu as moral hazard reappears in financial affairs and governments can no longer promiscuously float their spending on debt. Other countries have already discontinued their purchases of US Treasury paper. Where will the customers for US debt come from? (Answer: nowhere.) It’s just another way that nations and their people are forced to get real in a new disposition of things. For now, it has probably been demonstrated that central bank digital currencies are unlikely to work. (Nigeria’s eNaira program, the world’s first large-scale experiment in CBDCs flopped miserably.) Along with the tyrannical surveillance issues, too many citizens rely on transacting business in cash, and if the cash turns no-good, they will find other instruments for transacting, perhaps even things as crude and straightforward as gold and silver, with no counter-party risk, no leverage, and no bullshit attached. To me, though, reversion to hard currency would imply a devolution to far less-complex economies and much lower standards of living. All that runs counter to the current excitement about technological advances compensating for declining systems of modernity — derived from the 20th century religion of endless, limitless progress — creating evermore available (fake) capital. These are the expectations for Artificial Intelligence, advances in “green technology” (especially enhanced electric batteries), next-generation nuclear power, and energy tech not yet achieved but dreamed about such as atomic fusion and zero-point energy. Oil For now, the primary resource of our economy remains oil. All other technologies, including nuclear and “green” tech, still require oil for the production of their hardware and maintenance. US oil production reached an all-time high in late 2024 at 13.6million barrels a day — way higher than the old, pre-fracking era “peak oil” figure of 10-million b/d from 1970, and superficially impressive. Fracking has made all the difference the past two decades, but it is not a permanent installation in the human condition. The continuing production increase has come from enhanced drilling techniques even while the supply of tier-one “sweet-spots” in the Permian Basin of West Texas has markedly declined — and the Permian Basin is the last redoubt of economic shale oil (oil economically worth recovering) in the USA. Mr. Trump has promised loudly and often to “Drill, baby, drill.” Aggressive drilling and opening remaining frontiers like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production could extend America’s oil abundance on the short end, but there are no meaningful “exploration” prospects left in North America beyond that. We’ll be fooling ourselves. It’s been a nice ride, but the end is in sight. In the Permian Basin, the best drilling locations are increasingly rare as the more productive areas have been exploited. Production In the Permian has declined by 15-percent since 2020, according to data from Enverus. Break-even costs are rising. New well productivity per lateral foot is declining. ZIRP is bygone and the cost of capital (interest on borrowed money) is up with inflation. From 2009 to 2020 — the ZIRP years — investors flocked to shale oil stocks since they couldn’t make a buck on bonds. But the shale producers had trouble making money, even though they produced a lot of oil. Many went bankrupt. After that, investors grew shy about investing in shale oil. Going forward, the capital might not be there for these capital-intensive operations. With the old oil — say, conventional oil in Oklahoma, 1950, where you just banged a pipe in the ground and oil gushed out — the cost of drilling a well was around $500,000 per well (in today’s money). They produced thousands of barrels a day for decades. Shale oil wells cost between $6-million to $12-million per well, with horizontal drilling and fracking (utilizing vast amounts of water trucked-in, plus chemicals and fracking sand to keep the fractures open). The shale wells produce far less per day than the old conventional wells and they decline by over 50-percent in one year. After three or four years, they’re done. Do you see the difference? Higher oil prices are required to justify new capital expenditure. Yet day-by-day the declining American middle-class steadily loses its ability to pay more for oil and individuals and households go broke under the strain of higher prices. The overall dynamic of our economy starts to wobble. Fewer people can qualify for car loans, which is mainly the way American acquire cars. Car-makers are stuck with excess inventory. Eventually the car-makers’ business model fails. And, by the way, it ought to be clear by now that we will not transition from oil-based cars to all-electric cars — surely not at the same scale of mass ownership. Electric cars just cost too much. What happens when mass motoring becomes incrementally less mass, less democratic, something only for the well-off? Answer: It stops. It becomes a focus of resentment and rage. It loses its government subsidies (highway repair, etc). It also leads to the demise of America’s premier living arrangement: suburbia. I have written about this quandary for years. It has been hanging over America’s head, and we are unable to imagine how it plays out — mainly because of the titanic sunk-costs involved. We’ve invested so much of our historic cumulative wealth in building the infrastructure for this living arrangement that letting go of it is unthinkable. Yet, it is already becoming severely dysfunctional. And, of course, as that happens, its components — the tract houses, the strip malls, the office parks — will lose their value, meaning that it will become ever-harder for many people to successfully cash out of it and move elsewhere. And even so, where would that elsewhere be? That problem is exacerbated by the ruinous condition of American cities and their future trajectory. Many US cities have already failed outright — Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Buffalo etc. They are abysmally governed and falling to pieces. They are filled with purposeless humanity, lost souls, dangerous criminals, and ever-fewer places of employment. Even the arguably still-successful cities — New York, Boston, Miami — have attained a scale of operation that is not sustainable, not consistent with the resource and capital scarcities to come. They will have to contract, drop services, lose population — and the process will be very messy. Eventually, they’ll be smaller, but they still occupy some of the best geographical sites, so they will not disappear altogether. The contraction will take a long time to resolve. For the present, that leaves the thousands of small towns across America that have been drained of vitality and investment for decades. Despite the damage, they have two big virtues: they already exist at a scale more congenial to redevelopment in a resource-and-capital constrained time; and many of them are geographically proximate to places where food can be grown for their own support. We will discover that this is where the action will move to. This is where much of the remaining population will resettle as the giant cities and suburbia enter their epic decline. More Change Than You Bargained For The “Golden Age” euphoria is palpable in these weeks before the Trump inauguration. Wall Street is in a rapture imagining a renaissance of corporate enterprise as a punitive regulatory regime lifts. But, just as gigantic cities tend to fail on the issue of scale, the economy as a whole is in need of reorganizing at a finer grain of enterprise. Gigantism itself, gigantic corporations with their tropism for monopoly, have become increasingly ruinous for communities, households, and individual lives in our time. Americans need more autonomy in their economic lives. The trouble is, we might have to get there the hard way — via a general crash of things organized at too large a scale, which would force the necessary rebuild at a smaller and more local scale. This implies a coming second great depression. It’s not hard to imagine such a crash occurring in the first year of a Trump regime. For one thing, there are surely nefarious parties and persons who would like to see it happen, who might even seek to engineer a financial train wreck for revenge against Mr. Trump and his followers. Anyway, a severely overvalued stock market is begging for correction. Ditto the housing market (and the over-valued collateral it represents) that so much of finance rests on. Too many banks are insolvent. The debt quagmire ensures that government can’t rush to the rescue as it has in past emergencies to bail out the banks without destroying the dollar. You might also wonder about the proposition laid out in David Rogers Webb’s book, The Great Taking, about the meticulously planned scheme for central bankers to seize much of the collateral in the world, meaning all your stuff. Sounds a little grandiose and preposterous, perhaps, but the fact is that the regulatory authorities of Western Civ have rewritten the banking rules stealthily over the years so that anyone with a bank account is now considered just a low-order creditor whose assets can be taken in the event of a banking emergency. Your savings are just labeled “collateral,” and your “ownership” of the assets is not what you thought it was. The scam seems fantastic, but the rules are in place, waiting to be sprung. Mr. Webb’s concise 99-page book is available free as a pdf HERE. Of course, a global implosion of equity and bond markets would be the end of financial life as we’ve known it, and none of the abstract chatter about banking rules takes sufficient account of the grotesque social disorder that would attend such an event, so any Great Taking might end up being beside the point — the point being that everyone is broke, no one can transact, and things get awfully dire. But we get a bit ahead of ourselves going up that path. So, let’s return to things we know about. Mr. Trump’s proposed economic reforms have inescapable overtones of contraction. Paring down the federal government workforce may have many benefits, but it would likely cause a depression in the DC Metro area as jobs are massively eliminated, and the economic damage would radiate through the rest of the country as departments are trimmed and shut down, and the money flowing out of them stops. The effect of a tariff campaign could hurt American business in the short term. Import replacement is a laudatory goal, but it’s liable to be a rough road getting there. Supply lines will break. People and businesses will not get the things they need to do produce goods. It takes time and capital to set up new factories. The tendency will be to run production with robots as far as possible — so, where will the people earn a living? Robots will not become consumers. You must also wonder more generally whether it’s really possible to reenact the industrial orgy of the mid-20th century. Detroit will not be what it was in 1962. “Joe Biden” leaves behind an economy already auguring-in, concealed by monumental federal spending of money created out of thin air in the months leading up to the 2024 election to cover-up the failing private US economy. Also, all of the official reporting about jobs in 2024 was fake in order to juice the election for the party in power. US Government outlays for the year were $6.752 trillion against revenue of $4.919 trillion. Government can’t solve the problem of mass joblessness by giving everybody government jobs, and Mr. Trump is not philosophically aligned to that sort 20th century Big Government action. Anyway, too many jobs today are crap jobs toiling for merciless companies who mistreat their workers, so the very meaning of work has been degraded to a new kind of slavery. Plus, too many Americans do not work at all, but subsist on government hand-outs or on crime. How does this change? First, it doesn’t change without the nation going through a period of disorder, discontinuity, and distress. When it does change, the change will be systemic and emergent. It will not come from any top-down government or managerial process. It emerges from the circumstances that reality presents — specifically, the need for people to support themselves, to make themselves useful to their fellow humans, which relationships form into networks of business and work that become a social ecology, a community. So, the second Trump term could usher in a period of deep economic hardship as we try to figure out how to remake an American economy and rebuild those local ecologies of business. Can Mr. Trump assume a role anything like Franklin Roosevelt did in the 1930s? A paternal voice speaking directly to the people and offering them reassurance in a troubled time? They are obviously very different personalities. Also, the lingering political opposition to Mr. Trump is far more noxious on the Left than anything FDR faced from the Right in 1933. Today’s Left is still functionally insane, sunk in Marxian-Woke delusions, race-and-gender animus, and an intemperate libido for power, all of it boding ill for political stability. Americans are used to relying on faceless, distant authorities to take care them, to solve their problems: Social Security, Disability, Medicaid, insurance companies, courts. It all works very poorly now, and before long a lot of it may not work at all. We will have to take care of each other. There have never been so many single-person households as there are now. Loneliness and anomie are epic. When the Boomers are gone, that will likely be the end of nursing home care and assisted living at the cost of many thousands of dollars-a-month. The Boomers’ replacement generations are not nearly as wealthy. They missed the window for being able to buy McMansions that could be liquidated for millions to support end-of-life care. We’ll probably see the rise of households made of unrelated people. But the default setting for humans is the family and the extended family. Some human relations that were common in earlier eras of history, and absent in our time, could return. A little over a century ago, ten percent of the people employed in America were household servants, including what were then middle-class households. Today, only the very wealthy have servants. What hasn’t changed is that people need a place and a purpose, and a purposeful place in a household is not necessarily a bad deal in a civilized society. We just haven’t experienced it in many decades and many Americans would probably find the proposition ridiculous. Yet too many have no place in society and nothing to do, including activities that might be considered duties to one another. Many towns in the 19th century had institutions called the Poor Farm. Sounds terrible, perhaps, but it was a way of providing a place and real duties for people who had nowhere else to go and nothing to occupy them. It was generally organized as a local charity. Residents were expected to work to their ability, raise their own food in gardens, take care of livestock, do laundry and cleaning chores. Today, that might be considered “cruel,” but really, is it as bad as just letting many thousands camp-out on the streets, sunk in drug addiction? What it requires is the political will to organize useful, properly-scaled institutions around these needs. To get there, we must drop a lot of ideological pretenses. We face very serious problems with agriculture organized at the gigantic scale, utilizing multi-million-dollar machines (usually mortgaged), giant loans to put in crops, huge “inputs” of chemicals and fertilizers. That is probably coming to an end, too, despite the current techno-narcissistic fantasies of Agribiz. We’re probably going to need more human beings working directly on farms, smaller farms, with fewer giant machines, less borrowed money for putting in crops, and fewer chemical inputs. Which is to say, we’re probably going to see a larger percentage of the population at work growing our food than has been the case for a long time. I suppose it’s hard to grok our society becoming reorganized so differently, of reviving ways of living and working together that are consistent with human nature, proven over time, but considered out-of-date now. Obviously resurrecting relations like these requires major changes in our national psychology. Today, it is impossible to persuade a lot of citizens that they need to do something useful for a living. Or, to look at it differently, that there might be activities to fill their days that would interesting, satisfying, and rewarded with pay — rather than just loafing, getting high, and watching canned entertainment. Today, we lack countless occupational niches in society that used to allow people of very different abilities to find a place and a purpose, especially, now, people of low ability. If I am correct that the macro trend is to re-scale our economy and re-localize it, those places and purposes can return. It will probably also require a return of the eternal verities, too, as a means of managing social relations: truth, beauty, liberty, brotherly love, trust, fairness. . . conditions and behavior that we should at least agree to aspire to in a common culture worthy of our allegiance. I doubt that the incoming Trump administration sees things developing in the direction of downscaling, decomplexifying, and localizing. Rather, they seem to expect ever more grandiose enterprise, at least in what’s known as the private sector, even while they pare down government. But, really, everything in the everyday life of this nation will have to scale down and happen differently. We’re going to need fewer giant entities like Walmart and more local commercial networks of small businesses geared to local communities. As you may have inferred, I believe that circumstances will deliver us to that new disposition of things in any case, whether political leaders agree or not. If Mr. Trump is wise, he will recognize the trend and go with the flow. Other Parts of the World As I write, governments are falling all over the place. Olaf Scholz cannot form a governing coalition in Germany. In France, Emmanuel Macron’s ruling faction lost bigly in snap elections last summer with no clear majority for any coalition, and also in the EU parliamentary elections. Both countries are using lawfare to defeat their opponents. Mr Scholz’s and his allies are trying to outlaw the rising opposition Alternative for Deutschland (AFD) party, especially after the AFD showed growing strength in state elections in Saxony, Brandenburg, and Thuringia. The Paris prosecutor’s office is trying to nail Marine LePen on embezzling EU funds to pay staff salaries in her National Rally Party. Germany, the largest economy in the EU, has been busy committing suicide for the past decade. The country shut down its nuclear power reactor fleet entirely and went all-in for a “green” energy program (wind and solar) that has fallen far short of being able to supply its needs. It had just gotten ready to receive a reliable supply of cheap Russian natural gas in 2022 when somebody — probably the USA — blew up the Nord Stream One and Two pipelines. Joe Biden declared in so many words that he was going to “stop” the Nord Streams months earlier, so why not believe him? The Germans just rolled over for what would normally be construed as an act-of-war against it, by a NATO ally no less. Consequently, overnight Germany’s advanced industrial economy, its automakers, chemical companies, machine tool-makers, became uncompetitive in global markets and the German economy entered a slow death spiral. Europe is now supposed to be happy to get American liquified natgas, which is much more costly to transport and offload than Russian pipeline gas would have been. France was only marginally better off with its robust nuclear energy production to supply electricity, but it, too, lost access to cheap Russian natgas needed for industry and home heating. Meanwhile, the other nations of the EU have all to one extent or another joined the European suicide pact. The EU has been at war against its own farmers for years for reasons that appear completely insane — perhaps driven by Klaus Schwab and his World Economic Forum. The regulatory architecture of the European Commission is crushing business under its “green” energy and climate change mitigation agenda. Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) unexpectedly won the most seats in the last election, but not an outright majority, and could not form a working coalition. Wilders did not become prime minister —the job was assigned instead to one Dick Schoof, a career bureaucrat who most recently ran the Netherlands’ Intel service. Canada, entered political limbo in mid-December when Deputy Prime Minister and Finance chief (and WEF board member) Chrystia Freeland suddenly resigned and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau looked like he was fighting for his political life in parliament. Mr. Trudeau had only days before made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago for talks with Donald Trump, who mocked him most severely down there, calling Canada “our fifty-first state” and referring to Mr. Trudeau as “governor.” The Canadian dollar has been tanking since then and stands at 69 cents to the US dollar as I write. Mr. Trudeau will be gone early in the new year at the latest. He’ll be replaced by the Conservative party leader, Pierre Poilievre, who demonstrates an ability to think straight. The European Union regulatory overlayment has become an intolerable burden for the EU member nations. The EU seemed like a good idea at the time, and for many years basic operating principles like a common currency (the Euro) and the Schengen Agreement (free movement of member state citizens and goods across national borders) made daily life easier. But in recent years the EU bureaucracy adopted a set of insane polices: the programmatic destruction of farms and farmers; mass unregulated immigration from third world failed states; and antipathy to petroleum resources for the sake of debatable climate change. Aggravating all this is the unelected EU Commissioners’ lack of accountability to the public. Other technical issues, such as the EU’s lack of fiscal control over individual members and the problems that causes for bond issuance appear irresolvable. Once before, in 2012, financial turmoil has threatened the EU’s existence. But that crisis — the collapse of Greece and its ramifications — got “papered over” with bail-outs and accounting fraud. Now, Europe enters an era not just of critical financial imbalances, but of severe dislocations in the on-the-ground economy of real production. The flood of migrants continues and their aggressive antagonism to age-old European culture is on the rise with calls for Sharia law and a European caliphate. It’s getting to look like a tragi-farcical reenactment of the Mohammedan conquests of the Middle Ages. It’s draining EU members’ treasuries while they go broke from de-industrializing. And countless humiliations are heaped on the people: mass murders, beheadings, constant insults, street violence all over and, just last week, the Christmas market murders in Magdeburg. It’s at a breaking point. As Europe watches Mr. Trump successfully commence deportations, Europe will eventually follow — but not before a tumultuous period in early 2025 when rebellion sweeps away Leftist governments. The European Union could be swept away with them. Borders will harden, national currencies might return, and drastic realignment awaits. The United Kingdom looks like a lost cause due to the utter collapse of the conservative party, leaving Labor temporarily alone on the field, with the monumentally incompetent PM Keir Starmer in charge and an all-out Orwellian regime severely abusing the indigenous British people while it coddles hostile immigrants. That will not last a whole lot longer. Starmer will be chased out in the first half of 2025, just as Liz Truss (remember her?) got dumped in 2022. Waiting to enter at stage-right is Nigel Farage, a genuinely charismatic leader who is destined to become Britain’s Trump. After successfully leading the Brexit charge, he sojourned in the political wilderness like Churchill did between 1929-39. Now he leads the Reform UK Party, which is in the process of utterly eclipsing the broken Tories. Look for Farage to make his move quickly in 2025. Then there is the woeful situation in Ukraine. I’ve written about it often and will recapitulate it as succinctly as possible: The Ukraine War was an American neocon project to destabilize Russia and probably an attempt to gain control of its resource assets. Mr. Putin refused to get rolled and fought back. It has been a hugely costly disaster for Ukraine in blood, capital, and infrastructure. Not a cake-walk for Russia, either. But Mr. Putin will probably attain his objectives, which are: annexation of Donbas and Crimea and establishment of what’s left of Ukraine as a neutral, non-member of NATO. Mr. Trump is eager to end what he calls “this stupid war.” The catch is, how can he settle it expeditiously without appearing to capitulate? Mr. Putin will not budge from retaining Crimea and the Donbas provinces (“oblasts”). That is the condition for even entering talks. The humiliation associated with this project should be all Joe Biden’s, and in some respects certainly will be when his family’s entanglements and machinations are fully exposed, as they are certain to be. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin will solve the puzzle by pretending to negotiate over the port of Odessa, which will eventually be awarded to the rump Ukraine so it can have access to the sea for its essential grain shipments. They’ll tussle for a while over that but it will be all for show. The war will end. Ukraine will finally hold elections and Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be cast out like a dog that has peed on the rug too many times. I doubt he will survive the year. Both America and Russia pony up money to rebuild Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, but not much more. The world will come to understand exactly what happened. NATO will be a shadow of what it was, if it does not collapse altogether due to the rising political upheavals all over Europe. The Middle East I am not on the bus with the mob shouting about Israel as a perpetrator of “genocide.” Our own General Sherman put it succinctly 160 years ago: War is hell. Hamas should not have started one on October 7, 2023. For that, the Palestinians got hell. Hamas fighters should not have (literally) dug itself in amongst the Palestinian civilians of Gaza, with its labyrinth of war tunnels that the Israelis had to destroy if there would be any end to the strife emanating out of them. The essential problem in that corner of the world is that the region cannot support the huge and still-growing populations of most of the Arab states in it. It is mostly desert. The fantastic wealth of the oil age combined with other circumstances, such as the increase in grain production, to grow these populations. Tragically now, all that has reached a limit and things are going in the other direction: toward collapse. This slow-motion collapse expresses itself in political friction, mass migration, violence, and religious zealotry. The Jihadis are serious about murdering non-Muslims. Considering the action in Europe lately, the truculence of Muslim migrants towards their hosts there, it’s obvious that Jews and Christians are on equal footing as targets. The population Israel of Israel is 9.4 -million. The total population of Palestinians worldwide is estimated to be around 14.8 million as of mid-2024. This includes Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, within Israel, and in the diaspora across various countries. The population of countries adjacent to — Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria — is 145-million. Much of that Arab population subscribes to annihilating the state of Israel, and declares as much publicly all the time. Is Israel not supposed to take those threats seriously? Considering these odds, are you shocked and offended that the United States is an ally of Israel? Do you think that the United States has no strategic interest in any counter-balance to opposing interests in the Middle East? Grow up. The American Woke-Marxists want you to think that this relationship is illicit, unjust. They want you to hate the Jews and hate Israel. You’d better ask yourself: who do these Woke-Marxists serve? Not our interests, not American interests. Israel has managed to make its tiny desert country blossom over the past seventy-five years while also building a manufacturing and tech economy. Due to the constant threats against it, much of the wealth generated by that economy must be directed into the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). It is quite an accomplishment for this tiny state to stand-up against so many enemies. They have won two major wars against them in modern times as well as many periodic border clashes, intifadas, and skirmishes. Their enemies are deeply resentful and probably jealous of Israel’s economic success. The Oct 7, 2023, rape, torture, and murder attack by Hamas prompted Israel to mount an existential defense against an obdurately and garishly murderous enemy. Israel won the Gaza Strip territory from Egypt in the 1967 War. In 2005 it turned over governance of Gaza to the Palestinians. Among other things, the Palestinians could have turned Gaza’s twenty-five-mile-long beach-front into a premier Mediterranean resort. Instead, the Hamas government used the international aid funds they received to build miles and miles of war tunnels. Bad choice. They used Gaza as a launching pad for missile attacks and intifadas. More bad choices. 10/7/23 was a crossed red line. Now there is no more Gaza. The civilians will have to find somewhere else to go, and if their Arab neighbors won’t take them, then blame their Arab neighbors. They have been cast out for atrocious behavior. The Jihadis’ publicists want you to think that Israel has behaved badly. No doubt, the action by the IDF in Gaza was brutal. War is hell. In war, everywhere and always, soldiers act savagely. Americans did, at times, in Vietnam and Iraq. It is the reality of war. One lesson is that wars should not be started casually. Israel’s motive in this war is to put the war parties of its enemies out-of-business. It is close to succeeding now, with Hamas scattered, Hezbollah cut off from its sponsor, Iran, and Assad gone in Syria. Israel accomplished this with the “Joe Biden” regime pretending to support both sides in the conflict and finally having less influence than ever over the outcome. This is where things stand in December, 2025, but it is a very lively game-board, and there is much potential for new action and the entry of other players, which we’ll turn to now. Suddenly Syria Well, that was fast! Took twelve days (Nov 27 to Dec 8). Phhhhht!!! Assad, gone (to Russia). How’d that happen? Begin with the population problem I cited above: the region is poor. Expanding population against a contracting resource base will create great political and social stresses. Syria’s population grew dramatically from 7-million in 1972 to 22-million in 2022. Syria is a large country with distinct territories. Its easternmost region bordering Iraq and Turkey, Jazira, with the city of Raqqah, straddles the Euphrates River, a grain-growing corridor that used to feed the Syrian people. Many years of drought and botched irrigation projects have wrecked farming there. That was one factor in the mass migrations to Europe the past decade. Altogether, 6-million Syrians have fled the country since the Arab Spring in 2011. Jazira is also the location of Syria’s oil, which was grabbed by the US in 2019 when the country was racked by civil war. The region is a cultural crossroads, with a significant Kurdish population, bleeding over to Greater Kurdistan into Iraq and Turkey. Long story short: Assad’s Syria was badly weakened by food shortages, revenue shortage, and long-running civil war. He could barely pay his Army, and when the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebel forces pushed across the country this fall, his soldiers melted away. HTS has its origins in al Qaeda, and al Qaeda has its origins in the US intel blob and its neocon strategists. You can be sure that the US was involved in rooting out Assad. As we have seen before, these kinds of operations tend to be double-edged swords, which end up stabbing America in the back later on. In this case, imagine that by chasing Assad out we may have succeeded in turning Syria into Jihad Central of the Middle East. As soon as HTS was in control of Damascus, the capital, Israel sent its air force in and destroyed every military target, airfield, tank park, munitions depot in Syria so that it would not fall into the hands of Hezbollah, Israel’s Iran-backed enemy. Israel controls a small area of southern Syria near the Golan Heights. Israel had already done severe damage to Hezbollah earlier this year by methodically killing off its leadership, one-by-one. The exploding pager op also did enormous operational damage to Hezbollah. For now, Israel benefits from broken Syria. Iran has lost its geographical conduit for arms supply to Hezbollah. The HTS forces are Sunni and Hezbollah’s sponsor, Iran, is Shia, with all the built-in conflict that implies. All of a sudden, Iran has lost its influence in this region adjacent to Israel, the enemy it declares it wants to “wipe off the map.” The Turks were involved in the Syrian regime change, too. Turkey currently hosts millions of Syrian refugees from the chaos of the Syrian civil war. The Kurds in Syria are also a problem, linked to the PKK, a terrorist terror group inside Turkey. Turkey’s pugnacious president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, pivots between its alliance with NATO, its off-and-on strategic relations with Russia, and the Arab world with its cultural affinities. Turkey is a disgruntled NATO. For decades, it was openly and often derided by other nations in the west as “the sick man of Europe.” Yet, it controls the entrance to the Black Sea, which has always been a problem for Russia — they have gone to war several times — though Russia engages in development projects in Turkey these days. Don’t forget, Turkey’s Ottoman Empire controlled all of the Middle East and North Africa from the 16th into the early 20th century and its influence ranged into Europe as well. This was the time long before oil wealth juiced the Arab world. Populations were sparse then across what was then called The Holy Land. The indigenous Arabs still wandered the desert on camels and lived in tents. The Ottoman Empire collapsed in the First World War, and what you see on-the-ground over much of the region are artificial boundaries created by the British after the war for administrative efficiency. Mr. Erdoğan may harbor ambitions for Turkey to once again play a larger role in world affairs. It has the region’s largest standing army. For now, Turkey and Erdoğan enjoy somewhat enhanced regional influence. The counter to him has been the US’s penchant for creating failed states via CIA involvement with rebel and Jihad movements. Mr. Trump has dropped the hint that he’s inclined to keep the US involvement in Syria to a minimum. He begins his administration with a declared aversion to all the world’s current wars. I’d forecast the HTS government not being able to control much of the country and a continued arc toward failed nationhood, with friction and violence between many of the different groups still residing there. I doubt Israel wants to try to control it, since it is an obvious quagmire. Russia appears to be bowing out of direct involvement, too, but is rumored to be negotiating with HTS to maintain its presence at the Khmeimim Air Base and the Tartus Naval Base. The macro trend in many parts of the Middle East is a return to pre-modernity. The last hundred years of jet planes and Range Rovers will look like a strange, anomalous blip in history. China Whatever is going on in China, her leaders like to play the long game, looking ahead decades, fifty and a hundred years, while everyone else struggles to strategize from month to month. It doesn’t mean that China comes out a winner, though. Some of that long game is just hubris and pretense. China has plenty of problems. It developed into an industrial colossus overnight, and now the global techno-industrial economy it found such a big role in is wobbling, especially in Europe, which puts a huge strain on China’s export-oriented system. Its financial architecture has always been janky because CCP is so entangled with the banks, bourses, and giant business enterprises — and if it doesn’t like how things are going, the Party just pretends that everything’s great. Nothing can be allowed to challenge the CCP’s dominance. Eventually things break, though, and the Party has to create some new narrative to explain the breakage. Lately there are rumors of mass layoffs, and of many young people leaving the cities to return to the countryside. The population is skewed to the elderly, due to the many years of China’s one-child policy. There is, of course, the disastrous real estate bubble which continues to destroy the savings of households, since many Chinese did not trust banks or stock and bond markets, and instead invested in enormous apartment complex property development projects have been failing one after another. The CCP’s response has been to screw down CCP control over the people and their activities ever-harder. The party fears its own people and no regime has a guarantee to go on forever. Expect turmoil there in 2025 as economic depression creeps across the global economy. America’s problems with China over trade and manufacturing are likely to be eclipsed in 2025 by the gross intrusions and subversions that China has been allowed to make in US institutions and our economy with the assistance of the “Joe Biden” administration. The Chinese have infiltrated America’s research universities, telecommunications (especially the hardware for cell phones and 5-G microwave transmission), US Intel, and the corporate sector, stealing intellectual property and our manufacturing secrets. And, of course, China has deeply involved itself in elected officialdom — the Biden family’s grifting operations and Rep Eric Swalwel’s romance with the spy Fang-Fang, among the most notorious. Senator Diane Feinstein employed a Chinese spy as her limo driver and go-fer for twenty years, including the years 2009 to 2015 when she chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee. You can be sure that Congress is well-larded with Chinese money and the influence it buys. Expect to find out a lot more in 2025. It is one of the things that binds elected officials so tightly to the DC blob. Two other matters involving China require urgent attention and the waiting Trump admin is already talking about them. One is China’s large, recent purchases of US land, both prime farmland and real estate around US military bases. It looks like they are going to be ejected from these holdings, with or without compensation is not known yet. We might see inquiries as to how these purchases were allowed to happen. The second issue is the number of Chinese nationals, especially men of military age, who came across the border along with the millions of other illegal aliens that “Joe Biden” allowed into the country with zero vetting. In fiscal year 2023 — Oct 1, 2022 to Sept. 30, 2023 — that number was about 24,100. In fiscal year 2024 it was 24,400. You should assume that US intel knows something about some of them, but not most of them, and what they are up to here. Several Chinese “police stations” — that is, offices set up in US cities to control Chinese migrants in the US — have been discovered and busted the last several years. And then there was the case of the Chinese high-altitude “weather balloon” (actually suspected of being a military surveillance balloon) that the “Joe Biden” admin allowed to sail completely across the USA from the Pacific to the Atlantic before shooting it down offshore of the Carolinas. These Chinese activities around the USA in aggregate suggest a kind of stealth warfare aimed at eventually getting control of the North American continent and its resources. This would be consistent with fifty-to-a-hundred-year long-range strategic thinking. And it was apparently working pretty nicely until the elections of 2024. It should be pretty alarming, but somehow the alarm bells have not gone off until a couple of months ago. Questions, anyone? I’d forecast that the US and China will not go to war with China over Taiwan in 2025. It is too much of a losing proposition for all concerned. Both China and the USA will be preoccupied with domestic problems and trade negotiations in the year ahead. A Few Other Odds and Ends Keep your eye on Argentina and its president, Javier Milei. Argentina was the world’s seventh-wealthiest nation in the early 1900s, and from 1930s on, after many coups, the country slid into chronic decline, badly aggravated by the long-running dictatorships of Juan and Eva Peron, and followed buy decades more revolving military coups, Peronista governments, and neoliberal finance mischief that left the resource-rich nation broke. Enter Javier Milei (Mee-lay) in 2023 as Argentina’s “anarcho-capitalist” president, who ran the promise to “take a chain saw” to the parasitical bureaucracy. In year one of his admin (essentially 2024), Milei got rid of 35,000 government employees and balanced the budget for the first time in decades. Inflation is finally falling. The Argentine people have awakened from the successive Peronista / neoliberal zombie comas they have been in for decades. Prediction: in 2025 Argentina sets the pace for the revolution in Western Civ government. Melei has another successful year in downsizing oppressive, useless bureaucracy. He begins a pioneering national nuclear power program. Argentina begins to emerge as a major player on the world stage. El Salvador is ruled, shall we say, by the eccentric and very interesting President Nayib Bukele-Ortiz (known simply as Bukele), now in his second term. His campaign against gang violence that made El Salvador such a savage place has produced spectacular results. His new “Terrorism Confinement Center” is one of the largest and most modern prisons in the world. It was built to house 20,000 inmates. He has arrested an estimated 86,000 hardened gang-aligned criminals. El Salvador has the highest incarceration rate in the world — which is what happens after allowing criminal gangs to hold the country hostage for decades. From 2022 to 2023, the murder rate fell by approximately 69-percent. (Data for 2024 is not complete.) Mr. Bukele enjoys a 91-percent favorable rating among voters. In 2021, El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal tender alongside the US dollar. Mr. Bukele’s “Bitcoin Law” requires businesses to accept Bitcoin in transactions. (As I said above, Bitcoin as “money” is deeply problematic.) The government itself has been purchasing Bitcoin as a long-term investment strategy. The verdict is out as to how Mr. Bukele’s fate might be chained to Bitcoin. For now, he has managed an epic turnaround in a country that had been lost to anarchy and crime for virtually all its previous existence. Forecast: El Salvador will continue to thrive due to Mr. Bukele’s Napoleonic organizational skills, even if Bitcoin falters. That is all I have for you in this end of year forecast for the year to come. I will be amazed to hear if any of you read this document to its bitter end. For each of you personally: do your best to lead purposeful, ethical lives in 2025. Refrain from trying to push other people around. Take care of your own bidness. . . and keep abreast of the goings-on in the year ahead at good old Clusterfuck Nation! And, above all, stay calm and cheerful! You can visit the archive of past yearly forecasts click here, to see what panned-out and what didn’t. Making predictions, of course, is a mugg’s game. Visit the page with JHK’s books here: (click image): Damn, you weren’t kidding that this is a long post! It’s a bit depressing, while at the same time energizing as there are potential solutions for many problems. First order of business is to have Elon and Vivek borrow Milei’s chainsaw and do to the bureaucracy what Elon did to Twitter (fire 80% of the employees). These two will give new meaning to the song “Who let the DOGEs out”! Sorting out the political miscreants will take time and be fraught with many dangers, but Trump has surrounded himself with people dedicated to the elimination of those miscreants. He has assured their focus by bringing in those who have been previously violated by the blob. Trump’s success is far from assured, but he is the only chance we have. We will know he’s been successful when housing prices in the DC area collapse as the bureaucrats and the private sector companies sucking the teat of government are terminated. January 20th can’t come soon enough! Great recap of the world situation; and generally free of political bias...... Read it fully in 12 minutes; will be fwddg it to my many friends who do not take the time to learn what the hell is going on in our klusterfkd world ....thank you JHK! No posts Ready for more?

Title: Drill, Baby, Drill 2.0: Why Trump’s Return Will Bring Blockbuster Years For Natural Gas
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2024/12/27/drill-baby-drill-20-why-trumps-return-will-bring-blockbuster-years-for-natural-gas/
Time Published: 2024-12-27T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
In October 2008, with the economy reeling from the onset of the Great Recession and oil prices having spiked to $147 per barrel ($211 in today’s money), Vice Presidential candidate Joe Biden was asked during a debate to contrast his party’s energy policy with that of the Republicans. Biden said that their “only answer is drill, drill, drill. Drill we must, but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to be drilled.” His vice presidential opponent Sarah Palin pounced; “The chant is ‘drill, baby, drill.’ And that’s what we hear all across this country… because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into.” Biden and Obama won that election, though Biden woefully underestimated American ingenuity. During the Obama years drillers boosted natural gas production by 45% to 92 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), while oil output more than doubled to 9 million barrels per day (bpd). But the frackers were too successful, causing a global oil glut that drove prices down to $28/bbl in 2016 and bankrupted dozens of companies. The industry recovered during the first Trump term; with executives refocused on growing profits. Despite the industry’s antipathy for Joe Biden, U.S. oil output has climbed steadily during his presidency to a record 13 million bpd of oil and 125 bcfd of natural gas today. And again the world is in an oil glut. Prices are currently hovering around $70/bbl and OPEC is holding back nearly 5 million barrels per day of untapped production capacity against the world’s daily 103 million barrels of consumption. Meanwhile Chinese oil companies are predicting peak oil demand as widespread electric vehicle usage in the nation is replacing gasoline guzzlers. “The fundamental outlook is bearish,” writes oil analyst Michael Hsueh at Deutsche Bank. This is why the resurgence of Drill, Baby, Drill under the second Trump term will focus not on oil, but rather natural gas. Biden has been a decidedly anti-gas president. The biggest affront: in 2022 he instituted a moratorium on new approvals of liquefied natural gas export projects. In recent years LNG exports from the U.S. have grown from nothing to 12 billion cubic feet per day, about 8% of total domestic supply. Despite the permit ban, projects already approved and under construction have continued apace, and are set to more than double U.S. exports. According to Neil Beveridge, analyst with Bernstein Research, “The expected glut of LNG is still coming, but it has been delayed, with maximum supply now expected in 2026 or 2027” – just in time for Trump (who is widely expected to reverse Biden’s ban) to take credit. A large portion of U.S. LNG heads to Europe to replace sales of Russian pipeline gas halted by the war on Ukraine, and to Asia, where it lessens reliance on the burning of far dirtier and carbon-intensive coal for electricity. Supplying LNG to the world is only half of the Drill, Baby, Drill equation. New demand for electricity in the United States is set to surge during the Trump years, particularly because of the rise in artificial intelligence. McKinsey, the consultancy, figures that the electricity needed to power A.I. data centers will grow from 25,000 megawatts today to 83,000 mw by 2030. This could cost upwards of $300 billion of capital investment in power plants, buildings, transmission lines and server farms. Data centers power demand would grow to some 12% of all U.S. electricity, up from 5% now. Drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus shale of Pennsylvania. Observing this coming need for power, Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI and others have invested billions into everything from solar and wind to advanced nuclear and geothermal. Investors in new publicly traded nuclear startup Oklo include Chris Wright, Trump’s incoming Secretary of Energy and Sam Altman of OpenAI. Oklo says it will work with developer Switch to roll out 12,000 megawatts of new nuclear by 2044. That’s a lot, but won’t come soon enough. Until advanced nuclear is a real thing, gas has proven it is the only scalable bridge fuel capable of displacing coal. Over the past 20 years U.S. has reduced coal consumption 63% from peak down to 400 million tons per year, while natural gas use is up by more than half to 33 trillion cubic feet per year. As a direct result, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are down 15% over this period, the most of any developed nation. (China, by the way, continues to use record amounts of coal, 5 billion tons last year.) So the tech giants are turning to gas. One example: Meta recently announced plans to build a datacenter and 2,200 megawatt gas-fired plant in West Richland Parish, Louisiana, at a cost of $10 billion. Meta’s gas supplier is likely to be Occidental Petroleum, whose shares are down 20% this year to $48. Oxy is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s top holdings. Over the the summer it added several million more shares in the petroleum company at a price of nearly $60 per share. Investment analyst Chris Dowd at Third Avenue Management sees good times ahead for a cadre of other gas-focused exploration and production companies. These days he says his team is “licking its chops” on a micro-cap called SandRidge Energy. The Oklahoma City-based SandRidge (market cap: $406 million) emerged from bankruptcy a couple years ago and carries virtually no debt against a portfolio of some 450,000 acres of gas fields in the Mid-Continent area of Oklahoma and environs. Dowd loves that SandRidge has been keeping some of its wells “shut in” – holding on to gas in the ground rather than sell it at what has been historically low prices over the past year. Dowd says SandRidge has the potential to boost output 20% in short order to respond to LNG and A.I. demand. The company also has $1.6 billion of past operating losses to shield future earnings from federal income taxes. Biden’s permitorium “gummed up the inventory” of new wells needing to be drilled and fracked, says Dowd. “Once we get that flowing and don’t have the start-stop, we will have the machine really humming.” Coterra Energy is “another one that is a coiled spring,” says Dowd. “If we have ‘drill, baby, drill’ they can really lean in to adding production.” Coterra ($18 billion market cap) has been aggressive in buying back stock, but has a richer P/E of 15. Dowd prefers SandRidge. Trump is likely to allow the leasing of more federal lands for gas drilling. Biden’s Dept of Interior in 2023 leased only 161,000 acres of federal land, versus an average of 1.2 million acres a year during the Obama and Trump years. The reason is the Bureau of Land Management’s new “conservation and landscape health rule,” which places ecosystem health concerns (i.e. the threatened greater sage grouse and dunes sage lizard) on equal footing with the economic benefits of resource extraction. Of somewhat greater concern to the oil lobby is the Biden EPA’s newly finalized rules governing “fugitive emissions” of natural gas from fields and pipelines. Operators will have to pay $900 per ton of emissions, rising to $1,500 per ton in a few years. And they have to pay to install equipment to monitor those emissions and verify them using third parties. Many gas producers would welcome Trump efforts to soften or scrap the methane rules, which could cost billions of dollars a year in fines for the nation’s biggest emitters. One of those, Houston-based Hilcorp Energy, owned by billionaire Jeffery Hildebrand, recently agreed to a consent decree and $9 million civil penalty with the EPA over natural gas emissions from its San Juan Basin fields in the Four Corners region. Hilcorp teamed with Carlyle Group in 2017 to buy the decades-old San Juan assets for $3 billion. The field emits a lot because it consists of 12,000 gas wells across 2 million acres and hundreds of miles of gas collecting pipelines. Hilcorp promised to cut 113,000 tons of emissions there over 3 years – like taking 24,000 cars off the road. Some gas producers aren’t too concerned by such restrictions, because they have already been working not just to limit leaks, but to capture and permanently sequester carbon emissions. Chris Kalnin, CEO of BKV Energy, which raised $200 million in a 2024 IPO explains that his company has been injecting carbon dioxide underground at its shale fracking operations in north Texas. The work is monitored by gas detectors and third-party certified by American Carbon Registry, which mints non-fungible tokens representing the amounts of carbon sequestered by BKV and published them to the blockchain. This way BKV can sell its customers “decarbonized” gas, at a roughly $5 per thousand cubic feet premium. Alternatively, BKV can turn that gas into lower-carbon electricity at the 1,500 megawatt gas-fired power plant that BKV acquired in Temple, Texas. “We see multiple ways to win, aligned with megatrends,” says Kalnin. “The greens are on one side and drill, baby, drill is on the other side, and the silent majority is stuck in between,” says Kalnin. BKV (market cap $1.9 billion, $250 million ebitda) initially built up a gas position in the Marcellus shale of Pennsylvania, then in recent years Kalnin took the unusual tack of buying up assets in the birthplace of shale gas fracking – the Barnett shale field outside Fort Worth, Texas, where wildcatting legend George Mitchell proved out the combo of directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing. In 2020 BKV bought Devon Energy’s fields there for $500 million. And in 2022 it acquired ExxonMobil’s Barnett for $750 million. Kalnin says Exxon hadn’t made any meaningful investments there for years. “The Barnett is alive and well,” he says. And there’s plenty of shale gas left to frack all across the country. “They left huge meat on the bone.”

Title: What Drove The 70% Surge In Barclays Stock This Year?

BRISTOL, UNITED KINGDOM - OCTOBER 18: The sun shines on the Barclay's logo outside a branch of the ... [+] bank Barclay's on October 18, 2023 in Bristol, England. Barclay's has confirmed that it will close a number of branches due to changing customer habits with virtually all banking transactions now taking place online. The number of people visiting physical branches has fallen dramatically in the last five years, according to the company, with the Covid 19 coronavirus pandemic also contributing to changes to banking habits. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images) Barclays stock (NYSE: BCS) has gained about 70% year-to-date, as compared to the 25% rise in the S&P500 over the same period. In contrast, Barclays’ peer Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is up 35% year-to-date. Also see, What’s Happening With HSBC Stock? So what are some of the factors that have driven Barclays’ stock higher of late? Earlier this year, Barclays announced a strategic overhaul aimed at stabilizing its operations and improving profitability. The bank has shifted its focus toward expanding its domestic lending business in the U.K, including mortgage lending and personal loans, which offer greater stability. At the same time, it has been reducing costs in its more volatile investment banking segment. The company also bought Tesco Bank in a deal that was closed in early November in a move that bolsters Barclays’ retail banking presence in the UK. Barclays is also targeting over £2 billion ($2.5 billion) in gross cost savings and aims to improve its Return on Tangible Equity to over 12% by 2026, up from about 9% in 2023. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Barclays posted better-than-expected Q3 results. Net profits attributable to shareholders stood at £1.6 billion (about $2 billion), while Barclays’ revenues for the period rose 5% year-over-year to £6.5 billion. Growth was driven by the company’s investment banking business - which has considerable exposure to the U.S. market - fared well, led by renewed deal making activity as well as higher volatility in the stock markets, which boosted fee revenues. The bank is also seeing higher-than-expected net interest income - essentially the difference between the interest earned on loans and what they pay on deposits. Barclays raised its NII guidance for 2024 to £6.5 billion ($8.16 billion), up from £6.3 billion previously. This improvement is driven by slower-than-expected rate cuts in the UK and structural hedges that the company previously took on to mitigate the impact of falling interest rates. The increase in BCS stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 32% in 2021, -22% in 2022, and 6% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. We value Barclay’s stock at about $12 per share which is slightly below the current market price. See our analysis of Barclays’ valuation for a closer look at what’s driving our price estimate.

Title: From Apple’s record valuation to Zara’s share surge: An A-Z of financial markets in 2024

It was the year that the drawn-out Apple tax case finally came to a conclusion as the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) confirmed that the European Commission had been correct in deciding back in 2016 that the iPhone maker had received illegal state aid from Ireland and must pay the State €13 billion in back taxes, plus interest. Outgoing EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who persisted with the case, would tell reporters hours after the final ruling that she had broken down in tears when she learned the outcome. The €14 billion pot, including interest, held in escrow since 2018, took centre stage in the recent general election, featuring in all party manifestos as they pledged to spend the windfall on everything from housing to the green transition. The case had no bearing on Apple’s own share price, however, as it spiralled to new heights, making it the first business to beach the $3.5 trillion (€3.3 trillion) level. Bulmers ciders’ parent C&C was rattled in June when the drinks group restated three years of its earnings due to accounting errors, resulting in the company taking an underlying charge of €5 million and parting way with its chief executive of just over a year. C&C subsequently said that it will pay a €1.3 million settlement to the former CEO, Patrick McMahon. He had succeeded David Forde, who quit in May 2023 after the group incurred a one-off charge of €25 million related to the delayed implementation of a new business management system at one of its UK units. Corre Energy, the second-last company to float on the Irish stock market, in 2021, plunged 95 per cent this year as the storage developer for renewable energy required two emergency cash injections from large shareholders as it searched for a long-term investor and saw members of its original board, including its founders, depart. The Irish-run but Dutch-based company said in October that it was now prioritising capital expenditure on two projects in Germany, with the first of these on track for a final investment decision in 2026, after its previously most advanced project in the Netherlands encountered permit challenges. DCC, the Dublin-based but London-listed distribution and services conglomerate founded in 1976 by businessman Jim Flavin, moved to abandon its conglomerate roots in November as it set out on a path to sell its healthcare and technology units to focus on its fast-growing energy division. It follows the disposals over the past decade of DCC’s food and beverage assets, including the Robert Roberts tea and coffee and Kelkin health foods brand, the frozen and chilled foods logistics business, and recycling and waste management arm. Analysts estimate the healthcare and technology units could fetch a total of more than £3 billion (€3.63 billion), with the cash generated set to be returned to investors, most likely by way of share buy-backs. CEO Donal Murphy is hoping the narrowing of DCC’s focus will turn investors’ attention to how its energy division, which still earns most of its money selling fossil fuels to households, is increasingly targeting the green energy transition. The European Central Bank (ECB) and other big central banks remained centre stage during 2024 as they began to reduce interest rates following a series of hikes in recent years in a war against inflation. The ECB cut its key deposit rate a total of one percentage point spread across four quarter-point reductions since June. The rate-setting body for the euro zone expects inflation across the region to be back at its 2 per cent target next year, down from a peak of 10.6 per cent in October 2023. Wall Street in New York lured more Iseq heavyweights this year, with Flutter Entertainment, parent of Paddy Power and Betfair, delisting from Euronext Dublin, the Irish Stock Exchange operator, in January. It was followed in July by Smurfit Kappa, which moved its main quotation to the US on completion of its merger with cardboard box-making rival Westrock to form Smurfit Westrock. CRH had quit the Irish market in late 2023. Greencore more than doubled in value in 2024 following a tumultuous eight years, as its CEO of two years, Dalton Philips, steered a recovery for the maker of sandwiches to ready-made Italian meals for big supermarkets. In the process, Philips backed out of low-yielding contracts and leaned into trends such as the “joy of missing out” to push dine-in meal kits to those happy to forgo going out. Greencore’s earnings for the year to September topped the company’s own guidance, even after it had raised its forecasts three times during the period. Philips also signalled that the group is preparing to get back out on the acquisitions trail for the first time in years. Harland & Wolff, the Belfast-based shipbuilder that produced the Titanic, collapsed into administration in September, with insolvency practitioners at Teneo assigned to oversee the process, after it failed to find new funding to stay afloat. The company’s AIM-listed shares in London were suspended in August and ultimately delisted in October. The administrators entered exclusive talks the same month to sell the business to Spanish state-owned shipbuilder Navartia. A deal was agreed before Christmas. Ires Reit, the Republic’s largest private residential landlord, reached a truce with activist investor Vision Capital in April by offering two board seats to nominees of the Canadian firm as the group continued a strategic review into its options as the share price remained under pressure. Ires hired property industry veteran Eddie Byrne as its CEO that same month, succeeding Margaret Sweeney. The board concluded in August that a substantive sale of the group or its assets – which Vision had been seeking – was not in Ires’s best interests, though it committed to a “capital recycling programme”, selling off noncore apartment assets to unlock some value for investors. The outcome has yet to excite stock market investors. Ires’s shares fell over 17 per cent this year. Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) shares were in the doldrums this year as the US pharma and medtech giant continued to add to a settlement offer aimed at ending thousands of ovarian cancer lawsuits linked to its talcum powder. J&J moved in September to wrap the $9 billion (€8.54 billion) settlement in a pre-packaged chapter 11 bankruptcy of a unit, called Red River Talc, in Texas. A federal judge will decide on the validity of this route – which would end almost all cases – early next year. Kingspan was in focus in September as a long-awaited final UK report on the Grenfell tower disaster in London. The company’s Kooltherm K15 insulation board had been used for 5 per cent of the insulation behind the building’s cladding. The Cavan-based group didn’t know that its product had been used in the development and the report found that insulation was not the main cause of the fire that claimed the lives of 72 people. However, the chairman of the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, was scathing of the group for falsely claiming that a form of K15 had successfully passed fire tests that allowed it to be used on the external walls of high-rise buildings in the first place. It “knowingly created a false market” for the insulation, he said. Luxury goods groups from LVMH Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy and Kehring, owner of brands including Gucci, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga, to Swatch, whose watch brands span Omega to Longines, saw their shares slide this year amid uncertainty around demand out of the key Chinse and Japanese markets. Management consulting firm Bain & Company estimates that global sales of personal luxury goods will fall 2 per cent this year, with economic uncertainty shrinking the industry’s customer base. It reckons China, which had seen a sustained boom for years amid a growing middle class, is on track for a 22 per cent sales slump in 2024. CRH selected chief financial officer Jim Mintern to succeed Albert Manifold, who had pursued record levels of deal-making over the past 11 years to move the traditional seller of cement and other base materials into full-scale construction services, as of the end of 2024. Manifold earned $13.2 million (€12.5 million) last year and CRH said in its latest annual report that its “compensation structures will evolve to more closely align” with practices in the US, where it moved its main stock market listing last year. Nvidia, the undisputed darling of Wall Street as the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) computing, saw its shares soar over 190 per cent over the course of 2024 – pushing its market value to $3.43 trillion (€3.3 trillion) – as it continued to deliver blowout earnings. Its stock rose at a multiple of the pace of the other members of the so-called magnificent seven, which also include Facebook’s parent, Meta, Tesla, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Apple and Amazon. Japanese camera giant Olympus was in focus for all the wrong reasons in October when its German CEO, Stefan Kaufmann, was booted out amid allegations of the purchase of illegal drugs. Kaufman, who had joined a European unit of Olympus 21 years ago, was subsequently indicted by prosecutors, suspected of having taken possession of cocaine and the synthetic drug MDMA multiple times in Tokyo in 2023. Irish financier Paul Coulson’s Ardagh saw its riskiest bonds trade at below 20 cent on the euro during 2024 as investors became increasingly concerned about the glass and metal containers group’s $12.4 billion (€11.7 billion) debt pile – especially as the outlook for its glass bottles unit continued to weaken. The multinational glass and metal containers manufacturer for the drinks industry, built up by Coulson over the past 25 years, continues to weigh how to reduce its borrowings. The price at which its most-junior – or subordinated – bonds have been trading indicates that holders of these notes expect they will have to write off much of what they are owed as part of restructuring. Coulson owns about 36 per cent of the business, which traces its roots back to the now long-defunct Irish Glass Bottle Company. CEO quitting and firings hit record levels globally in 2024, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the international firm that assists “transitioning” executives find new roles. Big CEO exits include Laxman Narasimhan from Starbucks, who was ousted by his board in August after 17 months, Mark Schneider at Nestlé, Dennis Muilenburg at Boeing, Pat Gelsinger at Intel and Carlos Tavares at Stellantis, the car-making group whose brands include Peugeot, Fiat and Jeep. Reddit, the Californian social media company, made its long-anticipated stock market flotation on the Nasdaq in March in a deal that valued the business at $8.87 billion (€8.4 billion). The 19-year old company, popular for its member-led communities known as subreddits that span interest areas from world news to brain-rot memes, has seen its share price soar about 250 per cent since, helped by the posting its first-ever profit in the third quarter of this year, as a new artificial intelligence (AI) feature that translates English posts into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and German drove user numbers higher. Sterling became the surprise best-performing currency among those by G10 (group of 10 industrialised nations), following years of volatility that has seen it dubbed the British lira among other names, according to the Wall Street Journal. The pound rose as much as 5.2 per cent against the euro alone, as the Labour Party’s election victory in June lifted a lot of political uncertainty and the Bank of England trailed other big central banks in cutting interest rates. Still, that was nothing on the performance of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which soared as much as 150 per cent – turbocharged in November by Donald Trump’s re-election as US president. The Republican has vowed to make the US the “crypto capital” of the world. Elon Musk’s Tesla soared 29 per cent in the week of the Trump victory, pushing it above the $1 trillion (€950 billion) valuation mark amid hopes the president-elect’s highest-profile promoter on the campaign trail (who contributed more than $130 million to the cause) will see his companies get favourable treatment from the incoming administration. Still, China’s BYD overtook Tesla late last year as the world’s top seller of electric vehicles with its more affordable range. It also sped past Tesla in terms of overall revenues in the third quarter for the first time, helped by hybrid sales as well as battery-powered vehicles. Italy’s second-largest bank, Unicredit, ruffled political and labour union feathers in Germany in September when it swooped in to snap up a 21 per cent stake in Frankfurt-based Commerzbank with a view to launching a takeover bid. While chancellor Olaf Scholz has been a big proponent of an EU banking union, he denounced the Italian manoeuvre as “an unfriendly attack”. Unicredit has since launched a €10 billion bid for domestic rival Banco BPM – and its CEO, Andrea Orcel, has indicated he is unlikely to make a move on Commerzbank at least until German elections are done and dusted in February following the unrelated collapse of Scholz’s government. Still, he has since upped the Commerzbank stake to 28 per cent. Irish banker David Duffy led Virgin Money to a £2.9 billion (€3.5 billion) sale to fellow UK lender Nationwide Building Society at the end of September to create the second-largest mortgages and savings business in that market. The former AIB chief executive quit the Irish bank in 2015 for Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG), then a subsidiary of National Australia Bank. He led CYBG through an IPO in early 2016 and into a merger two years later with Virgin Money. Duffy stepped down as Virgin’s CEO as the Nationwide tie-up was completed and is estimated to have secured a pay-day worth as much as £15.3 million (€18.3 million) through the sale of shares and stock options he held in the bank. Walt Disney defeated a challenge to its board in April from activist investor and Brooklyn Beckham’s father-in-law, Nelson Peltz, handing a victory to CEO Bob Iger and ending one of the most expensive boardroom battles in history. The stock has rallied strongly in the past few months after the company reported better-than-expected results for its financial year to September, boosted by its streaming business and issued a rosier outlook than followers of the company had been used to in recent times. French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel set out on a path towards full ownership of Eir, as two US hedge funds began to exit their investment in the former Irish telecoms monopoly, in which debt market investors hold €1.35 billion of bonds. Firms belonging to Niel acquired 64.5 per cent of Eir in April 2018 in a deal that saw two of the company’s largest pre-existing investors, hedge funds run by New York firms Anchorage Capital and Davidson Kempner, roll most of their shares into a combined 35.5 per cent interest. It is understood that Davidson Kempner sold its 8.9 per cent holding in the business over the summer to Anchorage Capital. Anchorage began to gradually sell down the combined stake by participating in a share buyback by a holding company above Eir in October. Neil’s stake currently stands at about 69 per cent. The market interest rate – or yield – on French 10-year government debt rose above those of crisis-scarred Greece for the first time in late November as Michel Barnier’s government limped towards collapse after he controversially used special powers to force through his budget without a vote. Marine Le Pen’s far-right grouping and the left-wing New Popular Front united in early December to force through a no-confidence motion in the former Brexit negotiator’s government. Greece, which emerged from a third international bailout in 2018, saw its creditworthiness upgraded to investment grade in late 2023 by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, following 13 years of junk status. Its economy has grown faster than the EU average over the past five years, its government is rapidly reprivatising banks that were rescued during the crisis and it is repaying chunks of its bailout loans ahead of schedule. Zara owner, Inditex’s shares soared as much as 45 per cent in 2024, twice the pace of the wider European retail sector as its popular fashion ranges and nimble operations helped it cope better than some of its rivals with changing consumer demands. The group, which also owns the Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear brands, has been quicker to adapt to fashion trends and potential headwinds than some of its rivals, thanks to its tightly managed supply chain, according to analysts. Investors are also keeping a close eye on Inditex’s ambitious expansion plans in the US, its second-largest market by sales, where it opened its first Zara store in 1989 and where its Massimo Dutti brand has made a tentative return recently after a previous foray into market failed. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: From Aer Lingus pilots to Alias Tom: Who were the winners and losers in Irish business this year?

Mopping up the messy entrails of 2024 isn’t a straightforward job. What kind of year was that anyway? For much of the business world, it felt like a wait-and-see period – a damp purgatory for some, a cushioned holding pattern of a year for others. Plenty enjoyed a 2024 that was somewhere between reasonable and decent, if not the definitive bounce-back they had hoped for in January. Some started the year in positions of strength and went on to manifest more success than ever. Some, channelling corporation tax receipts, were worryingly buoyant. But within industries wracked by inflation, cost-of-living pressures and/or retreating rates of investment, “survive ‘til 25″ became the quiet catchphrase. Some ran out of money, then ran out of time. Some just wilted. Others swam in a sea of setbacks, gasping through another quarter, another season. Dispiritingly, those for whom the year could have been better included much of the hospitality industry. More than 600 restaurants, cafes and food businesses closed, according to the Restaurants Association of Ireland industry lobby group, as swollen costs and the legacy of pandemic debt overwhelmed them. In August, there was shock among restaurateurs as celebrated chef Dylan McGrath shut down two restaurants, Brasserie Sixty6 and Rustic Stone, warning that hospitality in Dublin was “simply not sustainable”. Other big names joined in the retrenchment: October saw Shanahan’s on the Green close for the foreseeable, while Dillinger’s in Ranelagh said goodbye to customers after a 15-year “wild ride”. For Press Up, the fast scaled-up group founded by schoolfriends Paddy McKillen jnr (son of the property developer) and Matt Ryan, there was something even more unpalatable on the menu: a reckoning. In September, London-based lender Cheyne Capital took control of the group in a debt-for-equity swap that aims to solidify its financials. One Wowburger and three Wagamama restaurants in Dublin were shuttered and though it later opened Asian restaurant Kaldero in the former Wagamamas outlet on South King Street, it was still a glum autumn for a group that had previously seemed immune from the woes of the sector. Not far away, a retailer at the heart of Dublin since the 1970s was counting the cost of changed fashions: Alias Tom, which in its time had clothed U2, Westlife and the business and political elite, went into liquidation, citing “the move toward less formal workwear”. Founded in 1976 by Tom Kennedy, Alias Tom once had exclusivity on brands such as Prada, Hugo Boss and Gucci. But in 2024, the “only realistic option” left for the company – 10 per cent of which was still owned by Kennedy – was to wind up. Dublin stockbrokers were part of the Alias Tom clientele at one point, but Dublin stockbrokers are now themselves a lesser spotted breed. As for the Irish Stock Exchange, which has traded as Euronext Dublin since 2018, this wasn’t a vintage year. In July, packaging group Smurfit Kappa, as it was then known, completed a hat-trick of heavyweight exits that started in 2023 with CRH and continued in January with Flutter Entertainment. Mention of the 231-year-old exchange in the budget speech of the somewhat younger Minister for Finance, Jack Chambers, reflected the extent to which a halving of companies on the Iseq All-Share index since 2018 was perceived to have become an Ireland Inc problem, not merely a Euronext one. It hasn’t helped that HealthBeacon and Corre Energy, two of the only three companies to take initial public offerings (IPOs) in Dublin over the past five years, have not had a tremendous time of it. By January, cash-burning medical technology company HealthBeacon had progressed from “embattled” status to officially in need of rescue. One arrived courtesy of US-based kitchen appliance maker Hamilton Beach Brands, but the company consequentially delisted. Corre Energy, for its part, spent most of 2024 watching its share price plunge. There was little else to do. The company develops underground storage facilities for renewable energy, but permit challenges have pushed back a crucial final investment decision on its key Zuidwending (ZW1) compressed air energy storage project in the Netherlands until after 2027. Back in February, co-founder Darren Patrick-Green exited his president and executive director roles after an unrelated business he owned was linked by UK revenue officials to a tax avoidance scheme. In November, with Corre still desperately seeking a strategic investor, chief executive Keith McGrane stepped down. A search for new executive energy began. The relief at the start of the year was that there appeared to be no sequel to “tech winter”, the job-shedding phenomenon of 2022-23 that had seen just about every technology company in town announce at least one round of redundancies. But 2024 ended on a bum note for the indigenous sector after the Government opted not to extend the National Digital Research Centre (NDRC) accelerator programme – which trains, mentors and invests in start-ups – beyond its November 2025 end date. It was open-letter time. [ The Irish Times view on the National Digital Research Centre: ending State funding is short-sightedOpens in new window ] More than 200 tech founders warned that if the Government didn’t reverse the decision, which they blasted as “disconnected from reality”, it would stymie future innovation and economic resilience. Alas, a general election had already been called by this point and no one was paying much attention. Michael O’Leary, an early election headline-maker, more often than not appears in the winners’ section of this annual review. The longest-serving chief executive of any large airline doesn’t really have bad years, not relative to everyone else. The short-haul king doesn’t even have to crack a joke for a roomful of Fine Gael supporters to collapse with laughter because they think he has. Alas, one of the key tasks to befall him in 2024 was to wait for multi-troubled Boeing to pony up the planes it owes his airline, and for that reason alone it can’t have been a hilarious year. The new executives in charge of the US manufacturer “continue to disappoint”, O’Leary was heard lamenting in summer. By October, he seemed resigned to the likelihood of having to “walk back our traffic growth” as a result of delivery delays he summed up in characteristic style as a “pain in the backside”. To the election, then. Losing slowly in count centres is a common fate, but presumably no less deflating for that. Caught up in a comprehensive greenlash, Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media Catherine Martin was second only to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on the high-profile casualties list. Martin, who will be missed by an arts community she supported better than most, came under Oireachtas committee-grilling pressure in the spring after she appeared to stir up tensions from nowhere with then RTÉ chairwoman Siún Ní Raghallaigh over the precise nature of the information conveyed to her about the procedures followed when RTÉ reached an exit agreement with former RTÉ finance chief Richard Collins. RTÉ hadn’t done anything wrong this time, but the organisation-reforming Ní Raghallaigh, baffled by the Minister’s arcane complaint, felt forced to resign, and later echoed Martin’s critics in the Opposition by accusing her of “taking a hands-off approach” to its various crises. It seemed there was also nothing any Minister could do, meanwhile, about airport operator DAA’s strange obligation – thanks to a 32 million passenger cap mandated by planning laws – to actually suppress passenger numbers at Dublin Airport. In August, the airport had the busiest month in its history. A good return on investment for the public money that is annually poured into promoting Ireland to potential overseas visitors? DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs, frustrated by the uncertainty and branding the cap “not the best look for Ireland”, was not the only one wishing it was that simple. As the year neared its close, one Irish export was confirmed as a toxic brand. Conor McGregor’s earning power unravelled at pace after a High Court jury upheld Nikita Hand’s civil claim that she was raped by the mixed martial arts fighter in a Dublin hotel. IO Interactive, the Danish owner of the Hitman gaming franchise, was the first to “cease its collaboration”. Then, one by one, every retailer that had previously been keen to sell McGregor’s Forged Irish Stout and Proper No. Twelve Whiskey destocked them. Proximo Spirits – the company to which McGregor sold his whiskey in 2021 – valiantly announced it would stop using his name and likeness in its marketing in a bid to save its acquisition. But with even the paraffin wax version of McGregor at the National Wax Museum taken out of circulation, the taint by association was unmistakable. Let’s swiftly segue now to some bona fide winners via the spectre of Donald Trump, a man who showed us all in 2024 that being a judge-confirmed rapist is no barrier to becoming US president. Trump’s election victory threatens to make losers of vast tracts of the planet, if not the planet itself – a cheery thought to dwell on when Jools Holland’s Rhythm & Blues Orchestra breaks into its traditional Hootenanny rendition of Enjoy Yourself (It’s Later Than You Think). But if the world ends in 2025, at least some people can say they went out on a high. Those highs were literal for Aer Lingus pilots. By late July, they were back in the air after a two-week work-to-rule period plus an eight-hour strike. Holding firm in the face of “management intransigence” meant they pocketed a 17.75 per cent pay increase – following a Labour Court recommendation – rather than the 12.25 per cent originally offered. They also won a boost to their allowances and swerved the rostering concessions sought by the IAG-owned airline. Along the way, the travel plans of 90,000 passengers were disrupted while, as the dispute hit the headlines, social media users were quick to spy a certain resemblance between Capt Mark Tighe, president of the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association, and one Captain Birdseye. He won’t have cared. For the pilots, the outcome was, he said, “the greatest pay award seen in 30 years”. After seeing his stock plummet within international tech circles in 2023, Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrave ascended once again this year to cruising altitude. He was back as chief executive of the events group, having served a six-month hiatus to placate the tech luminaries who found his stance on Israel – that “war crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies” – controversial. Some of them, including Meta and IBM, returned to sponsor this year’s event in Lisbon at which a more muted Cosgrave avoided any further turbulence. A memorable main character of another kind was at the centre of the film Poor Things, in which Emma Stone played an adult woman implanted with a baby’s brain, bringing home four Oscars and a box office take of $117 million (€110 million). [ Poor Things review: Emma Stone is properly unsettling in this provocative feminist fable drenched in Victorian horrorOpens in new window ] This was heartening for fans of unsettling, offbeat fantasy cinema. But it was even more rewarding for Element Pictures, the prolific Dublin production company led by Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe, with the total of 11 Oscar nominations garnered by Poor Things setting a new record for the most ever secured by an Irish-produced film. Another home-grown company generating joy was Smyth’s Toys. Accounts filed later in 2024 showed the retailer’s combined pretax profits across the regions in which it operates hit €54.6 million in 2023. That’s a lot of Lego. Indeed, with its businesses in the Republic and Northern Ireland now representing just 14 per cent of its total revenues, the Mayo brothers behind Smyth’s Toys have made expansion across Europe look like child’s play. Also doing well overseas was Co Tyrone’s Sarah Friar, the former chief executive of neighbourhood social networking service Nextdoor, who in June joined artificial intelligence hype-lodestone OpenAI as its chief financial officer, working alongside Sam “superintelligence” Altman. Another appointment of note came in December when Trump nominated Dublin-born Gail Slater as assistant attorney general at the US department of justice’s antitrust division. “Together, we will Make America Competitive Again!” the president-elect posted on Truth Social. Making America Healthy Again, genuinely, were the EY Entrepreneur(s) of the Year: Sharon Cunningham and Orlaith Ryan, the chief executive and chief technology officer respectively of Clonmel-headquartered Shorla Oncology. Their company, which raised $45 million this year, counts four US Food and Drug Administration-approved products within a growing portfolio of accessible, life-saving treatments for patients with rare, orphan and paediatric cancers. At the ceremony, Ryan described the award as “validation” for the Shorla team’s years of hard work. But whatever happened to those erstwhile Iseq stalwarts after they upped sticks from the Dublin stock market? It was onwards and upwards for Tony Smurfit as he moved seamlessly from his role as boss of cardboard box-making giant Smurfit Kappa to the new position of group chief executive of packaging mega-giant Smurfit Westrock. This followed July’s formal seal on the Irish company’s deal to merge with US peer WestRock. Smurfit Westrock, which has its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, reported a net loss for its first quarter as a merged group, booking $500 million (€461 million) of expenses and accounting adjustments related to the transaction. But its earnings otherwise pointed to “a strong foundation to build upon”, said a confident Smurfit. True, not every athlete at Paris 2024 was a huge fan of the sustainable cardboard beds the company supplied to the Olympic Village. The good news, however, is that these have now been recycled into “the equivalent of 1.5 million wine boxes”. Cheers! Cement-maker CRH, for a long time the largest stock on the Iseq, found itself enjoying New York life. In the 12 months after it relocated its main listing to Wall Street, its share price swelled 60 per cent. By autumn, it seemed not even bad weather could leave much of an imprint on its performance. It will be all change for the company in 2025, with acquisition-loving chief executive Albert Manifold set to be succeeded in the top job by his finance chief, Jim Mintern. Manifold earned $13.2 million (€11.9 million) last year, hanging on to his title as the highest paid boss of an Irish plc, but Mintern could be in line for an even bigger bonanza, with the company indicating that its “compensation structures will evolve to more closely align with US practices”. Insert dollar signs here. Will gambling company Flutter Entertainment have a ka-ching of a 2025? You wouldn’t bet against it. The owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, led by chief executive Peter Jackson, recently snapped up Italy’s Snaitech and a 56 per cent stake in Brazil’s Betnacional operator NSX Group – deals that give Flutter top three positions in most of the world’s regulated gambling markets. National Football League (NFL) results didn’t quite go the way of its US brand FanDuel in October, but you can’t win them all – not in the short term. Over the medium term, as more US states legalise sports betting, FanDuel and Flutter remain poised to cash in. There were comebacks of sorts this year for two Irishmen who both resigned from their previous roles after different forms of misconduct. Declan Kelly – who quit his global public relations firm Teneo in 2021 after accusations of drunken misbehaviour at a charity concert – spent 2024 signing up sports stars and business names for his new-ish advisory vehicle Consello, which expanded its operations into Ireland. As for former BP chief executive Bernard Looney, he was “wishing BP well”, he said, as joined the board of US data centre company Prometheus Hyperscale a year after he was obliged to resign from the oil giant for failing to disclose past relationships with colleagues. Having spent 32 years at BP, Looney (54) told the Financial Times he was “thinking about the next 32 years” of his career. Same, Bernard, same. It may take almost that long to assess the full ramifications of the creeping change and dramatic power swings we witnessed and endured in 2024. But for now, with the tendrils of Christmas already starting to unwrap, the only thing left to do is to wish everyone who deserves them many sustainably profitable returns in 2025 – and everyone who doesn’t, none. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Valve makes more money per employee than Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix combined

The big picture: Valve is one of the most important and influential companies in the PC gaming market. It's also one of the most unique due to its private nature and unusually small workforce relative to its impact and competitors. A recent analysis of data uncovered through an ongoing lawsuit against the company highlights how Valve starkly contrasts with the world's biggest tech giants. A Valve employee recently provided PC Gamer with a rough calculation of the company's per-employee income, revealing that Valve generates more money per person than several of the world's largest companies. While the data is a few years old and doesn't account for some significant recent trends in the tech sector, Valve's ranking in this metric likely hasn't shifted much over that time. Exact figures for Valve's per-hour and per-employee net income remain redacted. However, a chart from 2018 confirms that Valve's per-employee income exceeded that of companies like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet/Google, Microsoft, Intel, and Amazon. Click to enlarge Facebook's second-place ranking of $780,400 per employee – or $89 per hour – likely stands far ahead of competitors such as Apple and Microsoft because Facebook employs just under 70,000 employees compared to the two PC giants, which each have workforces over twice that number. By contrast, Amazon, with a headcount of over 1.5 million, earned only around $15,892 per employee, or $1.81 per hour. Filings from a 2021 antitrust lawsuit brought by Wolfire Games revealed that Valve employed just 336 people at the time – fewer than the development team for Baldur's Gate 3. Despite this relatively tiny workforce, Valve oversees Steam, which hosts nearly 40 million daily users and dominates the PC game sales market. Wolfire cited this discrepancy as evidence that Steam's 30 percent revenue commission for most titles is unjustified. Notably, the available data doesn't reflect the impact of the Steam Deck, Valve's handheld gaming PC, which launched in 2022. It's unclear to what extent Valve hired or outsourced additional staff for the device's development and production, but it's unlikely the company expanded its workforce anywhere near the scale of other tech giants. Valve would likely remain at the top of a per-employee income ranking based on current data. However, recent trends such as widespread layoffs and the ongoing AI boom could shift the standings for other companies. It would also be intriguing to see whether Nvidia has entered the ranking, as the AI explosion has propelled its profits to new heights, recently making it the newest member of the $3 trillion club.

Title: The era of big bets on EV plants in Canada is over - it’s time for consolidation, minister says

Full Content:
Industry minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has led the strategy that’s seen some of the biggest investments in the history of Canada’s auto sector.Tara Walton/The Canadian Press The era of Canada putting down big bets on massive new electric-vehicle battery plants is coming to end. As Industry Minister, François-Philippe Champagne has led the strategy that’s seen Stellantis N.V., STLA-N Volkswagen Group and Honda Motor Co. HNDAF commit to new factories in Ontario that represent some of the biggest investments in the history of Canada’s auto sector. A few months ago, Mr. Champagne was still talking up the possibility of landing one or two more such commitments from global automakers. But in a year-end interview with The Globe and Mail, he acknowledged he’s no longer big-game hunting the same way. Instead, the focus has shifted to solidifying the existing commitments during a turbulent period for the nascent EV sector, and leveraging them to grow out the domestic supply chain that they are meant to anchor. “Now, it’s about consolidation,” Mr. Champagne said, referring in particular to landing and advancing investments in mining and refining battery materials such as lithium, graphite and nickel. Repeatedly invoking a new mantra about the need to achieve greater “speed and scale,” he was tacitly acknowledging that Canada needs to dramatically pick up the pace for the battery plants to be supplied primarily by the country’s ample reserves of critical minerals – access to which was one of the main reasons cited by the automakers for placing the investments here. Mr. Champagne also reflected on how Ottawa’s EV-battery strategy has played out to date, defending the government’s billions of dollars in subsidies, in the face of mounting skepticism resulting from setbacks in the auto sector’s transition to EVs, as it has struggled with slower demand growth than expected. While that bumpiness has not derailed the three landmark battery plants in Ontario, it has jeopardized a fourth planned by Sweden’s struggling Northvolt AB, and seen other retreats such as Ford Motor Co. F-N putting off plans to assemble EVs at its facilities in Oakville, Ont. Quebec says Northvolt battery project will go ahead as company cuts 20% of global staff How much longer Mr. Champagne will be the point-person for the strategy is an open question, given that a federal election early in 2025 appears increasingly likely, and the governing party that he serves faces a double-digit deficit in opinion polls. But his perspective may be useful context for whoever is in office by the end of 2025, and tasked with deciding whether and how to double down on trying to turn Canada into a force in EV-making. One of his arguments is that subsidies for the battery plants will not be nearly as high as most people perceive – particularly when it comes to Stellantis and Volkswagen, which most media reports have suggested will top $28-billion in combined support from the federal and Ontario governments. (The Honda deal has a lower ceiling and is structured differently.) That figure is essentially the maximum total possible, contingent on the plants operating at full capacity from the earliest possible date, because it’s mostly derived from production subsidies per battery made that expire in the early 2030s. An arguable upside of the EV demand-growth slowdown, to which Mr. Champagne implicitly pointed, is that the cost for taxpayers will be lower because the factories – expected to be operational for decades – won’t need to ramp up as quickly. “People have this impression that we have dispersed that money,” he said. “But today, I’ve landed tens of billions of investments, and I’ve only dispersed a few hundred million.” He was somewhat more philosophical on the more negative consequences of the industry’s recent struggles, including for Canada’s large industry of parts-makers and other suppliers at the mercy of automakers’ rapidly shifting timelines for EV roll-outs – framing it as inevitable during a revolutionary industrial change. “If you look at the history of the world, when you have a shift in technology for the next century, the first few years are always bumpy,” he said. “My role, and the role of the industry, is not only to look at next week or next month or next year, but to position Canada for long-term success.” He also suggested that in the near-term, Canada is well-positioned to weather uncertainty around the pace of the shift away from internal combustion engines, because Ontario still has several assembly plants making vehicles with those gas-fuelled motors for the foreseeable future, as well as some (notably Stellantis’s Windsor assembly plant) building flexible platforms that can make both types of vehicles. In a possible nod to current political dynamics in the United States – where most Canadian-made vehicles are sold, and where president-elect Donald Trump’s EV skepticism may or may not be counterbalanced by Elon Musk’s role in his administration – Mr. Champagne repeatedly invoked Tesla Inc. as evidence of the need for patience. He did so on the premises that Tesla had plenty of highs and lows before establishing dominance of the early EV space, and that Tesla’s soaring stock price shows that investors retain faith in EVs ultimately taking over the market. Otherwise, he mostly steered away from commenting on the extent to which Mr. Trump’s threat to impose a 25-per-cent tariff on Canadian exports could hurt all forms of vehicle-making here, other than to express optimism that Mr. Trump’s sensitivity to markets – which could react negatively to massive disruptions of the highly integrated Canada-U.S. supply chain – will help dissuade him. Actually strengthening that supply chain in the coming years is partly contingent on the natural-resource question – whether Canada can kick-start its mining sector enough to supply not just domestic facilities but also U.S. ones, as industries seek to reduce reliance on China – which contributes to the government’s focus shifting upstream. Mr. Champagne touted a few examples of progress over the past couple of years – particularly at the mid-stream level, such as plans for Canada’s first copper-foil factory and a joint venture by General Motors Co. and Posco Chemical Co. Ltd. to produce cathode active materials, both in Quebec. He also noted the multifaceted nature of Honda’s investment in Ontario, which includes partnerships with Posco and with Asahi Kasei Corp. to make battery components. That could carry extra weight since Honda’s recently announced plan to merge with Nissan Motor Corp. to create the world’s third-largest automaker, which is widely seen as an effort to keep pace with Chinese competitors. And Honda chief executive Toshihiro Mibe hinted to The Globe earlier this year that his company is interested in further investing in this country’s natural resources. But while the effort to get more critical minerals to market does not rest entirely with whoever sits in his chair in cabinet – and is contingent on factors ranging from the federal Natural Resources ministry’s efforts to work with provinces to speed up permitting, to infrastructure investments, to the Finance Ministry’s implementation of mining tax incentives – it now requires the sort of entrepreneurial hustle Mr. Champagne brought to landing the battery plants. He acknowledged that it might have seemed more obvious to start upstream and then move downstream. The economic case for subsidizing the battery plants always rested partly on the establishment of a reliable market for Canadian resources, so it’s a significant hitch that Canada is not yet fully prepared to supply them. But Mr. Champagne contended that there was a narrow window during which the automakers were deciding where to situate the battery plants – which has now almost closed, with most such North American commitments already made – and he had to seize it. The alternative, he suggested, would have been to effectively give up on Canada’s long history of making cars and trucks, which was a real prospect a few years ago as a decades-long decline threatened to be worsened by being left behind in the EV shift. “One of the first briefings I got from officials was basically that [I would be] presiding over the end of the auto sector in Canada gradually,” he said. “And we turned what was a challenge into an opportunity.” Whether Canada’s efforts to position itself as a major player in the electrification of transportation hold up as a win in the long-run, though, will depend on the success of its next phase working backward to build a supply chain – whoever is steering it.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) Hits New Highs with $30.1B in Semiconductor Revenue – What’s Fueling the Surge?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other top performing dividend stocks in 2024. Over time, dividend stocks have shown consistent resilience in difficult market conditions. Despite the recent focus on AI, the long-term appeal of these stocks has grown. Income investors have noticed this shift, reflected in the increasing role of dividends in personal income. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices reveals that the share of dividend income has risen from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024, emphasizing the importance of dividends as a key income source. The report also noted that since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than a third of total equity returns in the broader market, with the rest coming from capital gains. The dividend growth strategy seems to be working for long-term investors as these stocks have generated strong returns over the years. Considering inflation, dividends have outpaced it, suggesting that investors should focus on these stocks. A report by Wisdom Tree highlighted that from 1957 to 2023, dividends grew at an average annual rate of 5.7%, which is over 2% higher than the inflation rate. The report also pointed out that dividends have only decreased in six years during the past 64 years, and only once by more than 5%. In comparison, stock prices fell in 18 of those years, with the worst decline exceeding 40% and an average drop of over 11%. Stock prices were more than twice as volatile as dividend cash flows, as short-term price movements are more influenced by market sentiment, while long-term value is driven by the stability of cash flows. READ ALSO: 10 Dividend Stocks For Steady Income This year, dividend stocks have underperformed compared to the broader market. The Dividend Aristocrat Index has gained only 6% year-to-date, while the market has surged by over 27%. Although this might seem discouraging for dividend investors, seasoned investors recognize that this presents a great opportunity to buy dividend stocks. Chris O’Keefe, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management, pointed out that the widening performance gap between the market and dividend stocks in 2024 creates an ideal time for investors to consider these equities. Along with O'Keefe, many analysts are encouraging investors to focus on dividend stocks due to their favorable outlook. The Dividend Aristocrats index has struggled to keep pace with the market since 2020. Dividend stocks saw a brief resurgence in 2022 as recession concerns led investors to seek out stable sectors like utilities and consumer goods, but the recovery was short-lived. By 2023, rising interest rates made bond and money-market returns more attractive than dividend yields, causing companies to adopt a more cautious stance and conserve cash amid economic uncertainty. This year, many of the top-performing stocks from the COVID era have once again driven the market to new highs. Despite underperforming for the past two consecutive years, analysts remain optimistic about dividend stocks. They believe that dividend-paying equities could see a resurgence in 2025, as investors are increasingly seeking cash returns. The broader market’s dividend yield recently dropped to a 20-year low, falling below 1.19%, significantly lower than the long-term historical average of 4.3%. With interest rates rising on risk-free investments like Treasuries, companies are recognizing the growing competition for yield. As a result, many are responding by increasing dividends or introducing them for the first time. Notably, several major technology companies began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market that they are positioning themselves as value plays within a high-growth sector. A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. For this article, we first used a stock screener to identify stocks that have reported positive returns in 2024 so far. From this selection, we chose dividend stocks with the highest year-to-date (YTD) as of December 25. The stocks were then arranged in ascending order of their YTD gains. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Year-to-Date Return as of December 25: 120.82% An American multinational semiconductor company, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks second on our list of the best performing stocks that pay dividends. The company offers a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. It recently announced its Q4 2024 earnings and reported revenue of $14.05 billion, which showed a significant growth of over 51% from the same period last year. Semiconductor revenue reached a record $30.1 billion, fueled by $12.2 billion in AI revenue. The AI revenue, which grew 220% year-over-year, was driven by the company's leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. In fiscal year 2024, adjusted EBITDA increased by 37% compared to the previous year, reaching a record $31.9 billion. Though Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has not provided full-year guidance, analysts anticipate the company's revenue will grow by nearly 19% in the current fiscal year, reaching $61.1 billion. Moreover, the semiconductor specialist is expected to see a 15% increase in revenue over the next couple of fiscal years as well. In addition to its strong earnings, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also showed a solid cash position. During the quarter, the company reported an operating cash flow of over $5.6 billion, and its free cash flow came in at $5.48 billion. This cash flow represented 39% of the company's revenue. Due to its growing cash flow, it announced an 11.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.59 per share on December 12. This marked the company's 14th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of December 25, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.98%. As of the end of Q3 2024, 128 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database held stakes in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), compared with 130 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $14.5 billion. With more than 23.4 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of the best performing dividend stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Slower AI spending could ignite a 'vicious' downturn for chipmakers, Nvidia supplier says

Semiconductor companies will suffer if Big Tech's spending on data centers slows, the head of the largest provider of chip-testing equipment told the Financial Times. Artificial intelligence-linked smartphones could save the day, he added. According to Advantest CEO Doug Lefever, the downswing wouldn't have to last long to have a pronounced effect on the industry. Given the concentration of hyperscalers in the space, he said, "any slowdown in the data center buildout is going to have big reverberations in the supply chain." Firms such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure, generating both excitement and apprehension on Wall Street. By the end of the year, hyperscalers will have spent an estimated $222 billion on AI chips and data centers to run the emerging technology. Although AI spending is projected to keep surging, some industry watchers have grown anxious about whether the spending spree can last — especially if AI doesn't live up to the hype. Even Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has warned about overspending on AI, which he described earlier this month as a "race to the bottom. " He added, "While there is a big movement of a lot of companies into these kind of public clouds, I think that we have to be careful exactly how much we're investing." Overspending fears briefly dented the performance of key semiconductor companies in September. Lefever has good reason to pay close attention to the space: Enthusiasm for AI has made semiconductors increasingly complex, boosting demand for Advantest's equipment. ADRs on the Tokyo-based stock are up 71.32% this year as a result. "I don't like to use the word bubble because it implies that it's going to go away, but there will be cycles," Lefever told FT. "When that next cycle comes . . . it could be pretty vicious." AI smartphones, however, could prove the industry's saving grace, Lefever said. "Everyone is holding their breath, waiting for the killer app with the AI handsets . . . if that happens and people start replacing their phones, it's going to be crazy," he told FT. Wall Street analysts are equally bullish over AI phones, a consideration already seeping into price targets. On Thursday, Wedbush Securities raised its target on Apple to $325, citing high expectations over Apple Intelligence — an AI software accessible on new iPhone products. "This will be a multi-year AI journey that will define the future for Apple with its next generation chip architecture, hardware releases, and future iPhone models built around the AI foundation that many consumers will ultimately embrace," analyst Dan Ives said.

Meta Platforms (META, Financials), Broadcom (AVGO, Financials), and Tesla (TSLA, Financials) all saw weightings within the Nasdaq 100 index shrink after notable stock price gains over the year. Bloomberg data shows that these changes aim to keep the index in balance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META. Among those earning higher weight were Apple (AAPL, Financials), Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Microsoft (MSFT, Financials), and Alphabet (GOOG, Financials; GOOGL, Financials). The rebalancing follows a rule limiting the total weight of the top five components to around 40%. Projected at 515,000 units with year-over-year rise, Tesla is likely to set a new quarterly record for vehicle deliveries in the fourth quarter. Third week of December saw 17,600 weekly insurance registrations for Tesla; its weekly insurance registrations in China showed a 12% rise over previous quarter and a 13% year-on-year increase. Although it declined consecutively from last week, Tesla's quarterly performance in the Chinese market is probably going to be outstanding. A tire pressure monitoring system issue that might lead to an accident by not sufficiently notifying drivers of low tire pressures has caused Tesla to issue a recall for over 700,000 automobiles. Among the specific models from 2017 to 2025, the recall calls especially for the Model 3, Model Y, and the 2024 Cybertruck. Tesla will provide a free over-the-air software update to address the problem. Although some recent dips, Tesla's stock has seen noteworthy rise and now ranks among the $1 trillion market capital value. Shares for this month are up 35%; for this year they are 87%. Broadcom officially joined the $1 trillion club driven by a demand for its chips running artificial intelligence. Its AI-generated fiscal 2024 revenue doubled year-over-year to $12.2 billion, therefore fueling total sales of $51 billion more. Forecasts of a 40% rise in fiscal 2025 and rising market share inspire experts about Broadcom's potential AI income growth. Claiming violation of its patents on "virtual machines," Netflix has sued Broadcom's subsidiary VMware. This legal action feeds ongoing disputes between Netflix and Broadcom that include claims of Netflix breaching Broadcom's video streaming technology patents since 2018. Broadcom's stock has exploded over 100% as demand from artificial intelligence customers takes hold. AI revenue surged 280% to $3.1 billion only in the last quarter. Broadcom's acquisition of a significant quarter growth driver, a cloud computing software company, VMware has also drawn compliments from investors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks struggled to meaningfully extend a "Santa Claus" rally the day after Christmas while Wall Street digested one of the only significant economic data points of the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell below the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell slightly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed the session up 28 points after flipping between positive and negative territory throughout the light trading session. Small cap stocks inched higher, sending the Russell 2000 (^RUT) up 0.9%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to hover near the $96,000 level as volatile trading continued. Crypto-linked stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR) tracked the declines. Markets kicked off the "Santa Claus" rally on Tuesday as the S&P 500 notched its best Christmas Eve performance since 1974, according to Bespoke. The broader index and Nasdaq Composite moved to within striking distance of their records after clawing back gains from a Fed-fueled dive last week. As Wall Street saunters back from its holiday break, the normally routine release of weekly jobless claims took more of a spotlight than usual as the only piece of the jobs puzzle on the docket this week. According to the latest Labor Department data, weekly jobless claims fell to 219,000 compared with expectations of 223,000. However continuing claims pointed to a cooling labor market, jumping by 46,000 in the week ending Dec. 14 to 1.91 million, the highest level since November 2021. Stocks closed mixed amid a light trading session on Thursday following the Christmas holiday break. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed just below the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 28 points, or nearly 0.1%. Stocks were little changed throughout the session, with the major averages flipping between positive and negative territory as the market struggled to meaningfully extend its Santa Claus rally. Small cap stocks however rose as the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gained more than 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 15% year-to-date, but Boeing (BA) and Nike (NKE) have been the big laggards of 2024. As Bespoke Investment Group pointed out, with the exception of Intel (which was booted off the blue-chip index in place of AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) in November), industrial giant Boeing is the biggest laggard, down 30% since the start of the year after a slew of production and safety challenges. Sports apparel com[any Nike is also down about 29% since the start of the year. Tesla (TSLA) extended declines to 2% on Thursday afternoon, making it difficult for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to firmly trade in positive territory. Still, shares of the EV maker are up more than 80% year to-date. The majority of those stock gains were achieved following Donald Trump's presidential victory in November, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk was instrumental in supporting. Trading volume for Tesla stock on Thursday was about 30% less than average daily volume, according to Yahoo Finance chart data. Bitcoin was trading 3% lower on Thursday afternoon as prices hovered below the $96,000 level. The token is down about 10% from its all-time highs north of $108,000 reached over a week ago. Despite the recent dip, bitcoin is up nearly 120% year to date, far outperforming other asset classes like gold and the major stock market averages. As Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports, 2024 has been a year when everything changed for the cryptocurrency once viewed as a fringe sideshow, a concern for D.C. policymakers, and a subject of ridicule for top Wall Street figures. Crypto's widespread acceptance this year translated into major gains for investors who were along for the ride. Stocks wavered by 1 p.m. ET, with the major averages flipping between positive and negative territory. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) hugged the flat line while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also little changed. Shares of EV giant Tesla (TSLA) and social media company Meta (META) both fell, weighing on the Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Meanwhile, chip stock Broadcom (AVGO) rose for a fourth straight day. GameStop (GME) stock rose as much as 10% early Thursday before paring gains. Shares were up roughly 6% midday. The stock's gain comes after infamous meme stock trader "Roaring Kitty" — whose real name is Keith Gill — posted a mysterious photo of a wrapped present on Dec. 25. GME's climb Thursday puts the stock on track to notch a roughly 16% gain over the past five days. The stock is up over 88% in 2024, fueled by Roaring Kitty's return to social media after three years of silence. Still, GameStop shares remain well below all-time highs of over $80 during the stock's short squeeze in 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early session losses by 11:30 a.m. ET. Shares of Honeywell (HON) and Boeing (BA) rose more than 1%, helping lift the blue-chip index slightly above the flatline. Apple (AAPL) touched intraday highs after a price target raise to a Street high of $325 from Wedbush analysts Dan Ives. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) pared early morning losses to trade just below the flatline. Apple (AAPL) stock hit an all-time intraday high Thursday after a nod of confidence in its continued upswing from Wall Street. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on Apple shares to a new Street high of $325, anticipating “a golden era of growth” for the Tim Cook-helmed tech giant in 2025. Apple stock touched $260 early Thursday before modestly paring gains. The stock was still on track to notch another record close after hitting a high of $258.20 on Christmas Eve. Shares have rallied more than 11% over the past month, and the iPhone maker is nearing a $4 trillion market cap. Read the full story here. Shares of AI chip heavyweight (NVDA) fell more than 1% while the rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks wavered on Thursday. Technology stocks led the modest market declines as the "Santa Claus rally" from Wednesday took a pause after the Christmas holiday break. Shares of iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) flipped between positive and negative territory during morning trading. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: If 2024 was the year of AI chatbots becoming more useful, 2025 will be the year AI agents begin to take over. Autonomous and semi-autonomous AI systems, you can think of agents as super powered AI bots that can take actions on your behalf, such as pulling data from incoming emails and importing it into different apps. You’ve probably heard rumblings of agents already. Companies ranging from Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) are increasingly talking up agentic AI, a fancy way of referring to AI agents, claiming that it will change the way both enterprises and consumers think of AI technologies. Read more here. Stocks opened lower on Thursday following a Christmas break, putting a pause on a Santa Claus rally. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 0.3% while the the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) declined 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.4%, leading the way down. All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 were lower, with Real Estate stocks leading to the downside.

The stock's gain comes after infamous meme stock trader "Roaring Kitty" — whose real name is Keith Gill — posted a mysterious photo of a wrapped present on Dec. 25. GME's climb Thursday puts the stock on track to notch a roughly 16% gain over the past five days. The stock is up over 88% in 2024, fueled by Roaring Kitty's return to social media after three years of silence.

Apple (AAPL) stock hit an all-time intraday high Thursday after a nod of confidence in its continued upswing from Wall Street.

US stocks struggled to meaningfully extend a "Santa Claus" rally the day after Christmas while Wall Street digested one of the only significant economic data points of the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell below the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell slightly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed the session up 28 points after flipping between positive and negative territory throughout the light trading session. Small cap stocks inched higher, sending the Russell 2000 (^RUT) up 0.9%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to hover near the $96,000 level as volatile trading continued. Crypto-linked stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR) tracked the declines. Markets kicked off the "Santa Claus" rally on Tuesday as the S&P 500 notched its best Christmas Eve performance since 1974, according to Bespoke. The broader index and Nasdaq Composite moved to within striking distance of their records after clawing back gains from a Fed-fueled dive last week. As Wall Street saunters back from its holiday break, the normally routine release of weekly jobless claims took more of a spotlight than usual as the only piece of the jobs puzzle on the docket this week. According to the latest Labor Department data, weekly jobless claims fell to 219,000 compared with expectations of 223,000. However continuing claims pointed to a cooling labor market, jumping by 46,000 in the week ending Dec. 14 to 1.91 million, the highest level since November 2021. Stocks closed mixed amid a light trading session on Thursday following the Christmas holiday break. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed just below the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 28 points, or nearly 0.1%. Stocks were little changed throughout the session, with the major averages flipping between positive and negative territory as the market struggled to meaningfully extend its Santa Claus rally. Small cap stocks however rose as the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gained more than 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 15% year-to-date, but Boeing (BA) and Nike (NKE) have been the big laggards of 2024. As Bespoke Investment Group pointed out, with the exception of Intel (which was booted off the blue-chip index in place of AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) in November), industrial giant Boeing is the biggest laggard, down 30% since the start of the year after a slew of production and safety challenges. Sports apparel com[any Nike is also down about 29% since the start of the year. Tesla (TSLA) extended declines to 2% on Thursday afternoon, making it difficult for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to firmly trade in positive territory. Still, shares of the EV maker are up more than 80% year to-date. The majority of those stock gains were achieved following Donald Trump's presidential victory in November, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk was instrumental in supporting. Trading volume for Tesla stock on Thursday was about 30% less than average daily volume, according to Yahoo Finance chart data. Bitcoin was trading 3% lower on Thursday afternoon as prices hovered below the $96,000 level. The token is down about 10% from its all-time highs north of $108,000 reached over a week ago. Despite the recent dip, bitcoin is up nearly 120% year to date, far outperforming other asset classes like gold and the major stock market averages. As Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports, 2024 has been a year when everything changed for the cryptocurrency once viewed as a fringe sideshow, a concern for D.C. policymakers, and a subject of ridicule for top Wall Street figures. Crypto's widespread acceptance this year translated into major gains for investors who were along for the ride. Stocks wavered by 1 p.m. ET, with the major averages flipping between positive and negative territory. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) hugged the flat line while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also little changed.

Decrypt conducted analysis using data from CoinGecko and Nasdaq to identify top-performing coins. To qualify, assets needed a starting market cap of at least $500 million, observed from January 1 to December 17. Other digital asset-related investments, including those of major companies, also did quite well. Here's a look at this year's top-performing assets. One of the newer meme tokens to sit near the top of the market, Pepe (PEPE), launched last year. The token is based on Pepe the Frog, an internet cartoon later labeled a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League after alt-right groups strangely adopted it. Pepe hit a new all-time high in December. The Ethereum-based token started the year with a market cap of $590.8 million, but landed at $9.4 billion by December 17—a 1,492% surge. Pepe grabbed headlines for—in typical meme style—its absurd rise in value and how rich it made a small number of traders. But unlike many assets in the bizarre space of meme tokens, Pepe kept going up, and it’s now the 28th biggest coin by market cap. It wasn’t long ago that the little-known Sui (SUI) came on the scene: Launched in May 2023, the blockchain was developed by ex-Meta (formerly Facebook) engineers and now has a buzzing DeFi community using its speedy network. Rapid blockchain Sui’s native SUI token has boomed this year. In January, its market cap stood at $925 million. A 1,193% rise means that by December, it had hit nearly $12 billion. SUI is now the 18th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Michael Saylor’s software company went all in on Bitcoin this year—and the firm’s stock shows that it was trading for less than $70 a share at the start of the year. By December, it had increased nearly fivefold—touching $386. That’s a 464% increase and better than everything else on the Nasdaq, including Nvidia. MicroStrategy was formerly a quiet software company. It then started buying Bitcoin in 2020 and rebranded itself as a “Bitcoin treasury company.” This year, the Tyson, Virginia-based entity accelerated its orange coin buys, promising speculators the best deal for Bitcoin exposure. Investors—including hedge funds looking to get volatile returns—piled in on the stock. The O.G. meme coin. Created as a joke to poke fun at the silly amount of altcoins being minted into existence, Dogecoin (DOGE) is now the seventh largest crypto by market cap. Its market cap jumped by 342% this year and now stands at $45.9 billion. Bitcoin’s rise certainly helped. It’s mainly got Tesla CEO Elon Musk to thank for that: The world’s richest man posted frequently about the asset in 2020-2021, and did so again this year amid speculation that the coin would be used on his platform X (formerly Twitter). XRP has had a strong year. The token facilitates transactions on the Ripple network, which provides institutions with a blockchain solution for cross-border payments. The token’s market cap has shot up so much that it’s now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, increasing 286% from $34 billion to $131.2 billion. It was briefly the third largest this month, overtaking Tether; and on January 1 of this year, it was sixth. The coin has made headlines over its dealings with the authorities. The SEC hit Ripple with a $1.3 billion lawsuit in 2020, alleging that the company sold unregistered securities to investors to raise funds. But last year, the company scored a partial win against the regulator when a judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP on crypto exchanges to retail investors did not qualify as securities. The ruling was interpreted as a win by Ripple—and the crypto industry as a whole—despite the judge ruling that $728 million worth of tokens for institutional sales constituted unregistered securities sales. Let's call this one an honorable mention, given the title of this article. It’s been an incredible year for Bitcoin, and the world’s biggest asset manager has played a part by making the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency available to all via an ETF. The iShares Bitcoin Trust is a traditional investment vehicle that allows investors to buy and sell shares that track Bitcoin’s price. The shares are traded on the Nasdaq. When it started trading in January, IBIT broke record after record with trading volume and inflows: By December, it had more than $50 billion in assets under management, achieving the milestone in just 228 days—quicker than any other ETF in history. Several other top asset managers also have Bitcoin ETFs trading, but BlackRock’s product has been the most successful.

US stocks held steady Thursday as trading resumed after the Christmas holiday and Wall Street digested one of the only significant economic data points of the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was little changed, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) held steady after erasing early morning losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.1%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to the $96,000 level as volatile trading continued. Crypto-linked stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR) tracked the declines. Markets looked to be struggling in a bid to extend the start of the "Santa Claus rally," which kicked off with a bang on Tuesday. All three major indexes rose around 1%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite moved to within striking distance of their records after clawing back gains from a Fed-fueled dive last week. As Wall Street saunters back from its holiday break, the normally routine release on weekly jobless claims took more of a spotlight than usual as the only piece of the jobs puzzle on the docket this week. According to the latest Labor Department data, weekly jobless claims fell to 219,000 compared with expectations of 223,000. However continuing claims pointed to a cooling labor market, jumping by 46,000 in the week ending Dec. 14 to 1.91 million, the highest level since November 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early session losses by 11:30 a.m. ET. Shares of Honeywell (HON) and Boeing (BA) rose more than 1%, helping lift the blue-chip index slightly above the flatline. Apple (AAPL) touched intraday highs after a price target raise to a Street high of $325 from Wedbush analysts Dan Ives. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) pared early morning losses to trade just below the flatline. Apple (AAPL) stock hit an all-time intraday high Thursday after a nod of confidence in its continued upswing from Wall Street. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on Apple shares to a new Street high of $325, anticipating “a golden era of growth” for the Tim Cook-helmed tech giant in 2025. Apple stock touched $260 early Thursday before modestly paring gains. The stock was still on track to notch another record close after hitting a high of $258.20 on Christmas Eve. Shares have rallied more than 11% over the past month, and the iPhone maker is nearing a $4 trillion market cap. Read the full story here.

Title: From Microsoft to Nvidia, the AI agents are coming in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. If 2024 was the year of artificial intelligence chatbots becoming more useful, 2025 will be the year AI agents begin to take over. You can think of agents as super-powered AI bots that can take actions on your behalf, such as pulling data from incoming emails and importing it into different apps. You’ve probably heard rumblings of agents already. Companies ranging from Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) are increasingly talking up agentic AI, a fancy way of referring to AI agents, claiming that it will change the way both enterprises and consumers think of AI technologies. The goal is to cut down on often bothersome, time-consuming tasks like filing expense reports — the bane of my professional existence. Not only will we see more AI agents, we’ll see more major tech companies developing them. Companies using them say they’re seeing changes based on their own internal metrics. According to Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business and industry Copilot at Microsoft, the Windows maker has already seen improvements in both responsiveness to IT issues and sales outcomes. According to Lamanna, Microsoft employee IT self-help success increased by 36%, while revenue per seller has increased by 9.4%. The company has also experienced improved HR case resolution times. As with any new technology, using AI agents will take some getting used to. But if they live up to the lofty expectations tech companies are laying out, they could win over plenty of users as an impressive new use case for generative AI. “If … you immediately get very rapid and very accurate and very meaningful and helpful responses, then that can start to change people's habits,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. “But changing people's habits takes a while.” The AI chatbot/AI copilot/AI agent discussion can be a bit confusing. After all, generative AI chatbots still feel like a new technology, and now we’re already being shuffled on to the next big thing. But those three capabilities are all part of the same overall system. Ray Smith, Microsoft’s vice president of AI agents, says you can think of an AI copilot as your main interface for interacting with your chatbot or assistant. Kind of like a home screen for your different AI needs. When you ask your chatbot or assistant to complete various tasks for you, it will reach out to the AI agents with the appropriate capabilities. If that sounds complex, here’s an easy example: Say you want to book a flight. You could tell your chatbot to see what flights are available for you, and it will use different AI agents to check your flight preferences, your calendar and availability, and potentially even your financial apps to make sure you’re getting a flight in your budget range and then come back with a handful of suggested flights. Earlier this month, Google debuted its experimental prototype, Project Mariner, which is capable of navigating the web and performing tasks via Google’s Chrome browser. In a video demo, Google shows an example of a user who needs to look up the contact information for a number of companies listed in a Google Sheets document. The user tells Mariner to memorize the list of companies, go to their websites, and find their contact emails. The agent then actively navigates to each website, grabs the email information, and provides it for each company. Google significantly sped up the process in the demo video, explaining that Mariner is still in its early stages and that it takes time for it to complete requests. But the company says accuracy and speed will improve quickly, though it doesn’t have a set release date. Apple’s (AAPL) Apple Intelligence will eventually offer AI agent-style functionality as well. In upcoming updates, the company says you’ll be able to do things like ask Siri when you should pick up your husband or wife from the airport. The assistant will then check your email to see when the flight is expected to land, check traffic via Apple Maps, and provide you with a suggested time to hit the road. According to Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman, agents will also be able to do things like help workers find potential business opportunities then help them set up and book meetings with prospective clients. Don’t expect high-powered, multistep AI agents to go mainstream as soon as the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Day. We’ll start to see a few next year, but it’ll likely take a bit of work to iron out all of the kinks. Instead, expect companies to lean into more basic enterprise use cases. “There's going to be also what I’ll call more boring agents that do productive things, things that automate IT processes, things that automate other tedious tasks,” O’Donnell said. “Those, I think, are going to become really important next year.” Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Title: The biggest gaming controversies of 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-26T14:00:53Z

Layoffs, politics, and the culture wars dominated 2024, but there were plenty of regular, everyday goofs, too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. 2024 was a big year for gaming, and so naturally it was also a big year for gaming-related controversies. While hand-wringing over fears that "videogames cause violence" seems to have subsided, at least for now, political and culture wars nonsense is more pronounced than ever. The videogame industry itself, meanwhile, continued to suffer decimation as funding dried up and executives who overplayed their hands during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic slashed headcounts in the name of "sustainability." There's no other way to put it: It got ugly out there. Of course, there were plenty of conventional fumbles too: Dissembling, dishonesty, and some straight-up bad calls provided plenty of "things that actually happened" for gamers to be unhappy about. From Facebook rejecting ads for board games to a weird cat game accused of being built with AI, here's our roundup of the year's biggest lowlights. Our face: 😕 What happened: When board game publisher Fort Circle attempted to purchase Facebook ads for a new edition of Votes for Women, a board game about the women's suffrage movement in the US, it received an unexpected surprise: Facebook said no. The problem, according to an automated response provided by Facebook to the publisher, is that the ad "mentions politicians or is about sensitive social issues that could influence public opinion, how people vote and may impact the outcome of an election or pending legislation." The outcome: You might think that such patent stupidity is the result of a bad algorithm making bad decisions, as they do, and you'd be correct. But when Fort Circle requested a review of the ruling, that too was rejected. Not being able to run ads had a material impact on the Votes for Women crowdfunding campaign—"Most Kickstarter creators will tell you that Facebook advertising is a crucial piece of the crowdfunding puzzle," Fort Circle founder Kevin Bertram said at the time—but more broadly it points to a pretty serious failure in Facebook's review process. Our face: 😡 What happened: In March, a little-known company called Sweet Baby Inc was suddenly thrust into the spotlight by "anti-woke" gamers outraged by, as one put it, the narrative consultants' promulgation of "ideological worldviews that I believe have taken hold of the Western world, media, and gaming as a whole." Which is of course nonsense: The company is contracted by developers who want to improve pre-existing elements of their games, and it has absolutely no power to force anyone to do anything—least of all make wholesale changes to their projects to enforce some sort of imagined "race and identity group quota." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The outcome: As ridiculous as it sounds (and is), the furor was (and is) real. A Steam curator group dedicated to "detecting" the presence of Sweet Baby Inc in games has now swollen to more than 460,000 followers, and the company was forced to lock its social media accounts following a torrent of abuse. Our face: 🤨 What happened: The Fallout TV show on Amazon was a hit, but it made some Fallout die-hards angry because of a perceived lack of faith to the lore. PC Gamer's Chris Livingston broke the whole thing down in detail, but the short version is that aggrieved fans believed Bethesda was using the Amazon show to erase Fallout: New Vegas—a fan-favorite in the series that was notably not developed by Bethesda, but by Obsidian—from the timeline. The outcome: Reactions to the conspiracy theory varied: Showrunner Graham Wagner said the wasteland isn't static and sometimes things happen, New Vegas lead designer Josh Sawyer understands the annoyance but really doesn't give a shit, and Todd Howard, the man currently atop the Fallout creative mountain, expressed mild exasperation about the whole thing, promising that "New Vegas is a very, very important game" to Bethesda. Bottom line? Everyone needs to simmer down. Our face: 🤔 What happened: Battlestate Games shot itself in the foot real good in April with the release of a $250 Unheard Edition of the game that included, among other things, access to co-op PvE—a mode that owners of other editions would have to pay to play. What really stuck in the community's craw, though, was a previously-released $150 Edge of Darkness edition that promised "free access to all subsequent DLCs," but that did not offer access to the new mode. Battlestate argued that the PvE mode was not DLC but a "unique feature of the new game," and thus didn't count. That went over about as well as you'd expect—extremely not well, to be clear—and Battlestate made the situation worse by dicking around with half-baked sops. It eventually offered six months of co-op play for free, but not until some future date because the servers don't have the capacity to handle everyone; on top of that, people who bought the $250 edition were promised priority matchmaking, meaning everyone else would be stuck in longer queues. They were also given access to in-game items protecting them from scavs and enabling more and better gear to be carried, conferring a distinct advantage over others, including those who bought the previously-prized $150 version. The outcome: As PC Gamer's Jake Tucker said, Battlestate "wiped out years of goodwill in one catastrophic week," but somehow it wasn't quite finished stepping on the Lego it'd dumped on the floor. After initially offering owners of the Edge of Darkness edition of Escape from Tarkov an option to upgrade to the newer release for $100 (what a deal), Battlestate reduced the upgrade price to $50; players who had already forked over $100 for the upgrade were offered $50 in "compensation," in the form of a single-use Escape from Tarkov voucher. Our face: 😣 What happened: Not content to sit quietly on the sidelines and watch Battlestate blow years of goodwill to smithereens with unforced errors, Bethesda said "hold my beer" and rolled out a "next-gen" patch for Fallout 4 that PC Gamer's Ted Litchfield described as nothing short of "calamitous." It wasn't just that the update changed so little, it actually made things worse: The added ultrawide support borked the UI, modded saves wouldn't load, and frame rate was still capped at 60. Adding insult to injury, the update rolled out on the heels of the hit Fallout TV show on Amazon, which had sparked a whole new wave of interest in and excitement for the game series, and the mod team behind Fallout London had to delay the total conversion's release to be sure it'd be compatible with the new version. The outcome: An update to the update rolled out a few weeks later, correcting a few issues but leaving the biggest problems for modders to fix. Many of them recommended the simplest fix of all: Use the Fallout 4 Downgrader tool to revert the game to a pre-"next gen" state and be happy with a game that works like it's supposed to. For the record, Fallout 4's next-gen patch hasn't been updated since. Our face: 😵 What happened: The Kerbal Space Program 2 controversy actually kicked off in early 2023 with a catastrophic early access launch, but it took a weird, drawn-out twist in 2024. In May, it was reported that KSP2 developer Intercept Games, along with Rollerdrome studio Roll7, were being closed as part of sweeping layoffs at parent company Take-Two Interactive. But shortly after that report, the Kerbal Space Program X account piped up, saying, "We're still hard at work on KSP2. We'll talk more when we can." Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick threw more confusion on the fire a couple weeks later, saying the closure report wasn't true: "We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear." Zelnick insisted he wasn't trying to be "cute or difficult" about the situation, but yeah, he was being kind of cute and difficult. Not too long after that, Intercept employees confirmed that large numbers of people at the studio, and possibly the entire team, was being laid off. The outcome: In November, Take-Two sold its Private Division publishing label to an unnamed buyer, and at the same time finally confirmed that Intercept and Roll7 had in fact been closed at some point prior to the sale. Take-Two still hasn't explained what happened between 'we haven't closed the studio' and 'the studio is closed.' As for Kerbal Space Program 2, it appears to be cooked: The KSP X account hasn't posted since the "still hard at work" promise in May, and the most recent game update—a relatively small bug-fix patch—went live in June. The game currently has a "mostly negative" overall user rating on Steam, and a concurrent player count that hovers around 100. Our face: 😐 What happened: Arrowhead's fascism-is-fun shooter Helldivers 2 was on a monster roll following its launch in February, but ran face-first into a concrete wall in May when Sony, the game's publisher, announced that players on Steam would be required to have a PlayStation Network account if they wanted to keep playing. That was the plan from the start, but the requirement was initially put on hold because of server issues when the game first went live. That didn't mollify players, who came hard with the time-honored tradition of a review-bombing: More than 220,000 negative reviews flooded into Steam, dragging Helldivers 2's "overwhelmingly positive" rating to "mixed." Sony stood its ground briefly but eventually backed down, leaving Arrowhead to clean up the mess. The outcome: An influx of positive reviews followed in the wake of Operation Cleanup, but like grassy fields in France that remain pockmarked with shell craters, evidence of the battle remains in the game's "mostly positive" rating on Steam: Good, but nowhere near what it used to be. And despite the debacle, Sony isn't giving up on the PSN account requirement on PC: President Hiroki Totoki said in November that linked accounts are necessary so people can "safely" play its games. Our face: 😬 What happened: Things went sideways in a hurry for Tekken pro Kim "JDCR" Hyun-jin, who was about to claim victory against opponent Alexandra "AK" Laverez at Dreamhack Dallas when his controller crapped out, eventually determined to be the result of someone who was previously connected to the setup turning their controller on. That forced a redo of the match, and that didn't go over well: As PC Gamer's resident fighting game pro Mollie Taylor recounted, "Twitch chat can be seen saying things like 'JDCR won that fair and square,' 'JDCR ALREADY WON,' 'JDCR got screwed,' and 'Jdcr won. This is rigged'." When the do-over match eventually went ahead, AK—who was undoubtedly going to lose prior to the technical trouble—came out on top, and the reaction was predictable. AK received "a heaping of rather undue hate," Taylor wrote: Some said he should have forfeited the match, others went so far as to claim that he'd intentionally sabotaged JDCR's controller connection in order to avoid a loss. The outcome: JDCR ultimately finished ninth in the tournament, just missing out on a top-eight finish that would have earned him a qualifying position at the Esports World Cup. DreamHack founder Alex Jebailey said on Twitter that he felt "incredibly sorry for what happened" and that he'd help JDCR attend future qualifiers for another World Cup shot. But, he added, "the amount of death threats and crazy things being said to me are pretty horrendous." Our face: 🤠 What happened: Starfield was a perfectly fine Bethesda RPG, but didn't quite live up to the pre-release hype. The mood among players soured further as months went by with minimal support, and the launch of the Starfield Creation Kit in June did not improve things. The big problem was the release of a single Trackers Alliance mission called The Vulture that cost $7, which thanks to the magic of Starfield Creation Credits bundle pricing was in reality $10. Unhappy players likened the DLC to Oblivion's infamous Horse Armor, the 2006 add-on that heralded the era of cosmetic microtransactions. The outcome: Horse Armor won in 2006, and despite the widespread early upset it looks like The Vulture did too: In response to the backlash, Todd Howard said "we hear the feedback" (ie., a small review bombing campaign on Steam) but Bethesda hasn't budget on the price, and it remains among the most popular of more than 2,700 Starfield creations. Our face: 🤬 What happened: Assassin's Creed Shadows has been a nexus of anti-woke gamer upset since revealing Yasuke, one of its two protagonists. Yasuke is a real-life historical figure who lived in Japan in the 16th century and eventually became an attendant of Oda Nobunaga. He's an ideal fit for an Assassin's Creed character, but he's also Black, and that caused great distress among certain corners of the gaming world, who very suddenly discovered a new commitment to historical authenticity (it's widely believed Yasuke served as a samurai, but not known for certain) and felt that featuring him instead of a "real" Japanese samurai was disrespectful to Japan. X owner Elon Musk amplified that sentiment in May, replying to a complaint about the game posted on his platform that "DEI kills art." Ubisoft's ham-fisted efforts to address what it apparently imagined were good-faith concerns about the game, meanwhile, only made the whole situation worse. It got to the point where even Reddit was sick of dealing with it. Other, more self-inflicted problems cropped up over the second half of the year. In July, Ubisoft apologized for using a real-life reenactment group's flag in Assassin's Creed Shadows concept art without permission, and in October the maker of a collectible said it would be redesigned following complaints that it bore a striking resemblance to the one-legged torii standing outside the Sannō Shrine, a remnant of the 1945 nuclear attack on the city of Nagasaki. Frankly, though, I don't think either issue would have attracted nearly as much attention had the anger pump not already been primed by the inclusion of Yasuke. The outcome: Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed in September to February 14, 2025, so we're still waiting to see how that works out, but it's been interesting watching Ubisoft grapple with the blowback. There seems to be confusion, or perhaps conflict, on how best to approach it: Executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté said in June that Musk was "feeding hatred," but in September, after announcing the delay, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot took pains to reassure everyone that "our goal is not to push any specific agenda" with games. But Coté is having none of that, saying more forcefully in November that some of Assassin's Creed Shadows' loudest critics post "lies, half truths and personal attacks online," and that "when we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away." Our face: 🤢 What happened: Guy Beahm, better known online as the streamer Dr Disrespect, was banned from Twitch for life in 2020. But the reason for his ouster remained a secret until June 2024, when a former Twitch employee alleged that Beahm was shown the door because he was caught "sexting a minor" through Twitch's Whispers messaging system. A few days later, Beahm acknowledged exchanging messages with a minor in 2017 "that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate," but insisted that "nothing illegal happened" and that he never faced criminal charges as a result of his actions. The outcome: The fallout was immediate and severe. Beahm was fired by Midnight Society, the game studio he co-founded in 2021, when the allegations first came to light; shortly after his public admission, 2K Games, Turtle Beach, the NFL, and YouTube also cut ties with the streamer. Our face: 😧 What happened: Destiny 2 studio Bungie laid off 220 employees in July, less than a year after an October 2023 layoff that saw a number of long-time and high-profile staffers put out of work. What really pissed people off, though, were claims that Bungie CEO Pete Parsons had spent more than $2.4 million on vintage cars over the two years leading up to the layoffs. Parson's money to spend, yes, and not a huge amount of it compared to the cash Destiny 2 has hoovered in over the years, but as PC Gamer's Harvey Randall put it, "Isn't it weird that he has so much of it while his now-former employees face anxiety over their basic living expenses?" Some former Bungie employees sure thought so. The reaction to Parsons' vehicular habits was no doubt amplified to some extent by his public performance in the wake of those October 2023 layoffs, in which he did his best to present himself as an innocent bystander rather than a well-paid, still-employed studio chief. As one person said in response to Parsons' post about those layoffs on X, "Your senior social lead probably would have recommended against this post, which you would have known had you not let them go." The outcome: Destiny 2 is still grinding along, but the road ahead hasn't gotten any smoother. In October, Sony carved off more of Bungie, making its Creative Studios arm a part of PlayStation Studios, and in December former Destiny 2 and Marathon director Christopher Barrett, who was fired in April over allegations of inappropriate behavior with female employees, sued the company for $200 million, saying Bungie "deliberately destroyed [his] reputation by falsely, and publicly, insinuating they had 'investigated' Barrett and 'found' he had engaged in sexual misconduct." Our face: 😮 What happened: Amina Abakarova, a 40 year-old chess player from the Russian Republic of Dagestan, was scheduled to play Umayganat Osmanova, a 30 year-old longtime rival who had beaten Abakarova into second place in a tournament the week prior. Not wanting to risk a second consecutive L, Abakarova decided to up her game by smearing liquid mercury all over the chess board and pieces they were meant to use. Mercury is of course very poisonous, and Osmanova began complaining that she was unwell, nauseous and dizzy around half an hour after the game began. Doctors were called in, and were fortunately able to prevent her from succumbing to the poison. The outcome: Abakarova might be a really good chess player, but she's not much of a criminal mastermind. She applied the poison in full view of security cameras, and was thus quickly busted by police. She reportedly copped to the whole thing, not because she wanted to win the match but just because she really doesn't like Osmanova, and now she's facing up to three years in prison and a lifetime ban from competitive chess play. It may not seem like a world-shattering controversy from our videogame-centric perspective, but it was a very big deal in the world of chess: Malcolm Pein of the English Chess Federation said he'd "never seen anything like this before," adding that it was "the first recorded case of somebody using a toxic substance, to my knowledge, in the history of the game of chess." Our face: 😒 What happened: Black Myth: Wukong is a good game and a major success, but it's also become a pivot point in the culture wars thanks to a 2023 IGN report on the long history of sexism at developer Game Science. The issue was put back under the spotlight in August 2024 when the studio sent out streaming guidelines just ahead of Black Myth: Wukong's release forbidding, among other things, "feminist propaganda" during streams. Naturally, the usual parts of the Twittersphere were thrilled to see a developer being so "based," especially since Black Myth: Wukong was a hit, proof positive that 'real gamers' don't want politics in their videogames, or somesuch. Others viewed the whole thing more as just strange and a little creepy. The outcome: Game Science has steadfastly refused to even acknowledge the issue: On multiple occasions, both before and after the streamer guidelines came to light, the studio has kept its head down and refused to comment on the controversy. Which may be a comment in itself: As PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon wrote, "It's hard not to read the silence as a sign that Game Science feels it has nothing to apologize for." Our face: 😶 What happened: Mega-YouTuber Jimmy "MrBeast" Donaldson had a good first-half in 2024, with his main account becoming the most-subscribed channel on the platform in June, but a very bad second half, as his media empire became embroiled in multiple scandals. Longtime collaborator Ava Kris Tyson was accused of grooming a 14-year-old fan after an exchange of inappropriate messages came to light, and while Donaldson quickly cut ties with Tyson, more trouble followed. Contestants in his Beast Games competition, a real-life Squid Games knockoff, complained of poor treatment, and former employees came forward to say some elements of his videos were either faked or rigged—and that they'd been mistreated themselves. The outcome: Rather than issuing the standard mea culpa that so often comes in the wake of this sort of thing, Donaldson is trying to power through it, keeping his head down, his mouth shut, and the videos rolling. So far it seems to be working: His subscriber numbers continue to climb, and his videos are still attracting hundreds of millions of viewers. Our face: 🙄 What happened: Legendary game designer and bullshitter extraordinaire Peter Molyneux said in August that he's "coming home" to PC, which would've been exciting news in, say, 2006. But in 2024, the bloom is off the rose thanks to a long series of catastrophes including Curiosity, Godus and the follow-up Godus Wars, and Legacy, a blockchain-based business sim that raised a huge pile of money in pre-release land sales (although apparently not quite the $54 million claimed by some reports) and then immediately tanked. Which isn't to say Molyneux's new thing, the god game Masters of Albion, will necessarily be bad. If anything, it actually shows some real promise: Superficially, it looks a bit like Populous mashed up with Fable, and if Molyneux's 22cans studio can pull it off, that definitely might not suck. The outcome: Impossible to say at this point because nothing else has happened, but memories of the last decade-plus will not be forgotten, and that puts the whole thing in a deep hole right from the start. I hope he's able to climb out of it and clock us all in the head with one final, great triumph, but the days of granting Molyneux the benefit of the doubt are long over. Our face: 😢 What happened: The online shooter Concord was one of the biggest, most spectacular flameouts in videogame history: After sinking vast amounts of money into the project, including the outright purchase of developer Firewalk Studios in 2023, mixed user reviews and abysmally low player counts sealed its doom immediately. Some hoped Concord might get a second shot at life as a free-to-play game, but Sony shot down that proposition in October: Concord, like the proverbial parrot, is dead. The outcome: It was an ugly mess by any measure, but what was particularly notable in the wake of Concord's failure was the glee it prompted from some corners of the gaming world: Gloating, memes, and shared screenshots of the game's concurrent player count on Steam dominated the post-closure discourse. PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde said "the eagerness to grave dance on unpopular games has become a bad habit," and he's absolutely right. Concord was at best a perfectly fine shooter trying to break into a crowded genre where "perfectly fine" isn't nearly good enough, and there's plenty of space for analysis and discussion of how it all went so completely wrong. But cheering its loss—and the subsequent closure of Firewalk—does no one any good. Our face: 🤢🤢🤢 What happened: The Dr Disrespect comeback tour began in September with a 20-minute rant on his YouTube channel, in which he said his Twitch suspension was primarily the result of a conspiracy against him. But it didn't really kick into gear until October, when YouTube declined to remonetize his channel. In response, the streamer teased "something much, much bigger" in the works, which in November turned out to be a move to Rumble, the right-wing streaming platform that hosts the likes of Dan Bongino, Steven Crowder, Viva Frei, Russell Brand, The Quartering, and the Tate Brothers. The outcome: Well, Dr Disrespect is on Rumble now. The numbers aren't nearly the same at this point—he's currently at a little over 76,000 followers on Rumble, a small fraction of the 4.55 million he'd amassed on YouTube—but he's not just streaming there: His deal with the platform includes equity in the company, and he will also lead Rumble Gaming, its videogame-focused livestream category. Lest there be any doubt about his commitment to the cause, the move came a month after he announced a line of "Make Gaming Great Again" merchandise modeled after the campaign slogan of US president-elect Donald Trump. Our face: 😠 What happened: Under pressure from the Anti-Defamation League, a major American non-profit that campaigns against antisemitism and promotes Zionism as a movement for "self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland," Twitch banned several Arab streamers in October over a TwitchCon panel that had occurred a month earlier. Panelists had put together a tier list ranking various streamers from "Arab" to "loves Sabra", an American and Israeli-owned hummus brand; Twitch partner and panel host Frogan said the panel was about "who has a habibi pass" (habibi is Arabic for "my love") but the ADL characterized it as "antisemitic vitriol." The ban came a week after Twitch suspended Asmongold for his racist tirade against Palestinians, and the discovery that Twitch had stopped signups with email verification from both Israel and Palestine for more than a year, which it said was done "to prevent uploads of graphic material" following the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023—a "temporary" measure it apparently forgot to reverse. The outcome: Following weeks of back-and-forth complaints of Islamophobia and antisemitism on the platform, Twitch rolled out a policy requiring a warning label for streams about vaguely-defined "politics and sensitive social issues," which included discussions about topics including "reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration." Twitch modified the guidelines a few days later to remove LGBTQ+ references but the rules remained too vague to be useful in any meaningful way; days after that, again under pressure from the ADL, Twitch forbid the use of the word "Zionist" to "attack or demean" other people or groups, but said it could still be used in its political context. Our face: 🤡 What happened: X owner and soon-to-be co-president of the United States Elon Musk made the bizarre statement on his platform that "too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations," before promising that "xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!" The outcome: Setting aside the fact that making games is really hard and nobody knows what an "AI game studio" is beyond some imagined Star Trek-style fantasy that doesn't actually exist, the statement was especially strange coming from a man with whose net worth is counted in the hundreds of billions—he's literally the wealthiest man on the planet—and who heads up a number of pretty famous "massive corporations" of his own. The real motivation for Musk's promised move into the industry was revealed by a later tweet to be less about concerns over corporate ownership, and more about wanting games that "skip the woke lecture." The segment of the gaming community up in arms about "wokeness" in videogames was thrilled to see Musk wading into the fray, but there's been no more said about it since. Our face: 😔 What happened: Hardware maker NZXT came under fire in December for its Flex PC rental service, which a Gamers Nexus exposé called a "predatory, evil rental computer scam." Specific complaints included allegations that NZXT would sometimes swap out components in rented PCs with less powerful hardware, use seemingly false or misleading benchmarks, and lock rental customers into unfair contracts. The outcome: NZXT defended its practices in response, but acknowledged that it "messed up" on some points. It committed to greater clarity on various points of the program and an end to "influencer-led" advertising, and also spent a good chunk of text laying out the "use case" for the Flex rental program, which NZXT said "allows for flexibility and lower commitment than owning or financing a PC." The response did not calm the waters: A video of NZXT CEO Johnny Hou discussing the matter has received 331 likes on YouTube, and more than 6,400 dislikes. Our face: 🐱 What happened: Catly, a weird game about cats, dropped a reveal trailer at the 2024 Game Awards. Rather than being greeting with the presumably-expected "awww, they're so cute," though, the trailer sparked immediate speculation (and some straight-up accusations) that it was made with generative AI. The game itself, from the very little that could be seen of it, struck many as little more than an NFT showcase. Those concerns were heightened by reports that Kevin Yeung, the co-founder of developer SuperAuthenti, is also co-founder of TenthPlanet, a studio that definitely is (or at least was) working on blockchain projects. The outcome: SuperAuthenti has been oddly quiet about the whole thing, although it did eventually state that Catly does not use AI and has "zero blockchain technology." Beyond that, we'll have to wait and see: A post-announcement update to the Steam page provided a closer look at what the game is all about, but more details won't be revealed until sometime in 2025. Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80. From there he graduated to the glory days of Sierra Online adventures and Microprose sims, ran a local BBS, learned how to build PCs, and developed a longstanding love of RPGs, immersive sims, and shooters. He began writing videogame news in 2007 for The Escapist and somehow managed to avoid getting fired until 2014, when he joined the storied ranks of PC Gamer. He covers all aspects of the industry, from new game announcements and patch notes to legal disputes, Twitch beefs, esports, and Henry Cavill. Lots of Henry Cavill. I'm still reeling from the knowledge that the Windows 10 desktop background is a real photo and not CGI We learned just how small Valve really is this year, but also how good it is at raking in the cash: It's making more money per employee than Apple The NZXT Relay is a flawed set of speakers but it's also my favourite bit of hardware from 2024 thanks to its ingenious stand PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: More Reasons For Cautious Optimism About The Demise Of The Green Energy Fantasy

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/26/2024 5:13:04 AM PST by MtnClimber My post on Saturday noted one big reason for optimism that the green energy fantasy is coming to the end of its run: the first country, Germany, has apparently begun to hit the green energy “wall.” Although Germany has never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar, its ability to continue its green energy dreams has stalled: its electricity prices have soared, its manufacturing sector has been seriously undermined, its economy is in recession, and recently its green-promoting government has fallen. Its failed example now stands for others to see and avoid. And as I look around at developments since the election, I see a number of other reasons to reinforce my cautious optimism. Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances”On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

There is no way out. Germany can’t build new nuclear power plants - the Gaia worshipers would never tolerate it. They can’t burn coal for the same reason. They have to buy their natural gas at spot market prices which are considerably higher than they were paying and they can’t compete at those prices. You will see more and more manufacturers closing down plants in Germany and opening plants overseas. 6 posted on 12/26/2024 5:57:45 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: V_TWIN Eric Hoffer, the “longshoreman philosopher,” nailed it many years ago: “Every cause begins with a movement, which develops into a business, and ends up being a racket.” Good word choice. 7 posted on 12/26/2024 5:58:29 AM PST by hinckley buzzard ( Resist the narrative.)

The corn ethanol boondoggle is probably the most successful of these scams and has many corn state members of Congress in their pocket. Ironically the corn ethanol boondoggle is now shown to be a major producer of the dreaded CO2, but fear not another climate scam is proposing a pipeline across Iowa and the Dakotas to transport the dreaded CO2 so it can safely be disposed by injecting it deep underground in North Dakota. There is a sucker born every minute and most suckers reside in Washington, DC. 20 posted on 12/26/2024 9:05:36 AM PST by The Great RJ [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel”On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New JerseyAlso on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading.

The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding.

Title: How Stocks Perform After Nasdaq-100 Rebalancing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It’s that time of year again — the annual rebalancing of the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX). The NDX represents the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. On Monday, three new companies were added to the index, and three others were removed. When a stock is included in a widely followed index, it often generates demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds, while removal typically leads to selling pressure. These changes were announced about a couple weeks ago, meaning much of the buying and selling has already occurred. This week, I’m examining what happens once these stocks begin trading in the index. One theory is that the announcement of additions and removals can shift sentiment, and if the initial buying or selling overshoots, it can create opportunities going forward. Before diving into the historical data, the tables below show the stocks that were added as well as those removed. Goin back to 2010, I tracked 80 stocks added to the NDX and 73 removed. We don’t have data on some of the stocks that aren’t trading anymore. I am also only considering stocks added and removed in December during the rebalancing. I will not be considering stocks eliminated and added mid-year due to bankruptcy, mergers, etc. The tables below summarize the returns of the stocks added and removed since 2010. The stocks that were removed performed better than those added. Stocks added to the index in December averaged a return of 3.81% over the next three months, compared to a 7.27% gain for those removed. Over the next three months, less than half the stocks added beat NDX, but 56% of those removed beat the NDX. One year later, the stocks added to the index averaged a gain of about 12%, with 40% of the stocks beating the overall index. Those figures underperform compared to stocks removed from the index, which averaged a pop of 18% over the next year, with 52% of those stocks beating the NDX. Based on these numbers, there could be merit to the theory that sentiment tends to get too bullish for those added, and too bearish for those removed. Next, I incorporated analyst ratings to identify stocks with extreme sentiment. Stocks added to the index are prone to excessive bullish sentiment. Using my historical data, I focused on stocks added that had at least 80% of analysts recommending a "buy" on the day they were added. This may be an indicator of sentiment being too bullish. Conversely, stocks removed from the index can attract excessive bearish sentiment. I analyzed stocks removed with 20% or fewer firms sporting a "buy" rating. If this theory holds, stocks added with bullish sentiment may underperform, while those removed with bearish sentiment may outperform. The numbers in the table below suggest there’s merit to the theory. For those one-year returns, stocks removed where 20% or fewer firms had a "buy" rating averaged a gain of 34% in the next year, with 58% of stocks beating the index. This means it may be worth considering Moderna (MRNA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) as potential stocks to buy. The data below also suggests avoiding stocks that were added that have at least 80% of analysts calling it a "buy." In the next year, these stocks gained less than 5% on average, with just 22% of them beating the NDX. Axon Enterprise (AXON) stock was added to the index this year, and all 15 firms call it a "buy." Our data suggests it has an increased chance of underperforming moving forward. MicroStrategy (MSTR) doesn’t meet the criteria of the study, because I only considered stocks with at least 10 brokerages in coverage. However, all eight analysts suggest buying SMCI, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it underperforms going forward. Sign in to access your portfolio

Oracle's co-founder has gained roughly $75 billion in paper wealth as the software company he started in 1979 enjoyed its biggest stock rally since 1999 and the dot-com boom. While the S&P 500 index has gained 27% in 2024, Oracle shares have shot up 63%, lifting Ellison's net worth to more than $217 billion, according to Forbes, behind only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos among the world's richest people. At 80, Ellison is a senior citizen in the tech industry, where his fellow billionaire founders are generally decades younger. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose net worth has also ballooned past $200 billion, is half his age. But Ellison has found the fountain of youth both personally and professionally. After being divorced several times, Ellison was reported this month to be involved with a 33-year-old woman. And at a meeting with analysts in Las Vegas in September, Ellison was as engaged as ever, mentioning offhand that the night before, he and his son were having dinner with his good friend Musk, who's advising President-elect Donald Trump (then the Republican nominee) while running Tesla and his other ventures. His big financial boon has come from Oracle, which has maneuvered its way into the artificial intelligence craze with its cloud infrastructure technology and has made its databases more accessible. ChatGPT creator OpenAI said in June that it will use Oracle's cloud infrastructure. Earlier this month, Oracle said it had also picked up business from Meta. Startups, which often opt for market leader Amazon Web Services when picking a cloud, have been engaging Oracle as well. Last year, video generation startup Genmo set up a system to train an AI model with Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, in Oracle's cloud, CEO Paras Jain said. Genmo now relies on the Oracle cloud to produce videos based on the prompts that users type in on its website. "Oracle produced a different product than what you can get elsewhere with GPU computing," Jain said. The company offers "bare metal" computers that can sometimes yield better performance than architectures that employ server virtualization, he said. In its latest earnings report earlier this month, Oracle came up short of analysts' estimates and issued a forecast that was also weaker than Wall Street was expecting. The next day, the stock fell 7% in the worst performance of the year, eating into the gains for 2024. Still, Ellison was bullish for the future. "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world's most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds," Ellison said in the earnings release. For the current fiscal year, which ends in May, Oracle is expected to record revenue growth of about 10%, which would mark its second-strongest year of expansion since 2011. Jain said that when Genmo has challenges, he communicates with Oracle sales executives and engineers through a Slack channel. The collaboration has resulted in better reliability and performance, he said. Jain said Oracle worked with Genmo to ensure that developers could launch the startup's Mochi open-source video generator on Oracle's cloud hardware with a single click. "Oracle was also more price-competitive than these large hyperscalers," Jain said. Three months before its December earnings report, at the analyst event in Las Vegas, Oracle had given a rosy outlook for the next three years. Executive Vice President Doug Kehring declared that the company would produce more than $66 billion in revenue in the 2026 fiscal year, and over $104 billion in fiscal 2029. The numbers suggested acceleration, with a compound annual growth rate of over 16%, compared with 9% in the latest quarter. After Kehring and CEO Safra Catz spoke, it was Ellison's turn. The company's chairman, technology chief and top shareholder strutted onto the stage in a black sweater and jeans, waved to the analysts, licked his lips and sat down. For the next 74 minutes, he answered questions from seven analysts. "Did — did he say $104 billion?" Ellison said, referring to Kehring's projection. Some in the crowd giggled. "That's going to be so easy. It is kind of crazy." Oracle's revenue in fiscal 2023 was just shy of $50 billion. The new target impressed Eric Lynch, managing director of Scharf Investments, which held $167 million in Oracle shares at the end of September. "For a company doing single digits for a decade or so, that's unbelievable," Lynch told CNBC in an interview. Oracle is still far behind in cloud infrastructure. In 2023, Amazon controlled 39% of the market, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 8.2%, according to industry researcher Gartner. That left Oracle with 1.4%. But in database software, Oracle remains a stalwart. Gartner estimated that the company had 17% market share in database management systems in 2023. Ellison's challenge is to find opportunities for expansion. Last year, he visited Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, for the first time to announce a partnership that would enable organizations to use Oracle's database through Microsoft's Azure cloud. Microsoft even installed Oracle hardware in its data centers. In June, Oracle rolled out a similar announcement with Google. Then, in September, Oracle finally partnered with Amazon, introducing its database on AWS. Oracle and Amazon had exchanged barbs for years. AWS introduced a database called Aurora in 2014, and Amazon worked hard to move itself off Oracle. Following a CNBC report on the effort, Ellison expressed doubt about Amazon's ability to reach its goal. But the project succeeded. In 2019, Amazon published a blog post titled, "Migration Complete – Amazon's Consumer Business Just Turned off its Final Oracle Database." Ellison looked back on the history between the two companies at the analyst meeting in September. "I got kind of got cute commenting about Amazon uses Oracle, doesn't use AWS, blah, blah," he said. "And that hurt some people's feelings. I probably shouldn't have said it." He said a friend at a major New York bank had asked him to make sure the Oracle database works on AWS. "I said, 'Great. It makes sense to me,'" Ellison said. The multi-cloud strategy should deliver gains in database market share, said analyst Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho, which has the equivalent of a buy rating on Oracle shares. Cloud deals related to AI will also help Oracle deliver on its promise for faster revenue growth, he said. "Oracle right now has an end-to-end stack for enterprises to build their AI strategy," said Panigrahi, who worked on applications at Oracle in the 2000s. So far, Oracle has been mainly cutting high-value AI deals with the likes of OpenAI and Musk's X.ai. Of Oracle's $97 billion in remaining performance obligations, or revenue that hasn't yet been recognized, 40% or 50% of it is tied to renting out GPUs, Panigrahi said. Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment. Panigrahi predicts that a wider swath of enterprises will begin adopting AI, which will be a boon to Oracle given its hundreds of thousands of big customers. There's also promise in Oracle Health, the segment that came out of the company's $28.2 billion acquisition of electronic health record software vendor Cerner in 2022. Unlike rival Epic, Oracle Health lost U.S. market share in 2023, according to estimates from KLAS Research. But Ellison's connection to Musk, who is set to co-lead Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, might benefit Oracle Health "if there is a bigger push towards modernizing existing healthcare systems," analysts at Evercore said in a note last week. They recommend buying the stock. For now, Oracle is busy using AI to rewrite Cerner's entire code base, Ellison said at the analyst event. "This is another pillar for growth," he said. "I think you haven't quite seen it yet." Hours earlier, Ellison had put in a call to Marc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce. Benioff knows Ellison as well as anyone, having worked for him for 13 years before starting the cloud software company that's now a big competitor. "It was awesome," Benioff said in a wide-ranging interview the next day, regarding his chat with Ellison. Benioff spoke about his former boss's latest run of fortune. "Larry really deeply wants this," Benioff said. "This is very important to him, that he is building a great company, what he believes is one of the most important companies in the world, and also, wealth is very important to him."

December 26, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for FEAT and FIVY is December 16, 2024. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about each Fund, visit our website at www.YieldMaxETFs.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. ZEGA Financial is the sub-adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs other than FEAT and FIVY. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: How Consumers Can Prepare For Trump's New Tariffs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dearbeawalker/2024/12/26/how-consumers-can-prepare-for-trumps-new-tariffs/
Time Published: 2024-12-26T11:00:00Z

Donald Trump is threatening tariffs on all imports from Mexico, Canada and China. This will impact the price of everything from washing machines to garlic. Here’s how you can prepare. Weekly grocery bills are likely to get more expensive if President-elect Donald Trump follows through in imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China. Everything from avocados to garlic will go up. That new car you’re eyeing—or even your next grocery run—could cost more after President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump plans to sign an Executive Order on day one that would impose 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, and threatens additional tariffs on products from China and elsewhere. Trump said that tariffs will “make our country rich,” because the U.S. “right now loses to everybody.” Specifically, Trump has said he'll boost tariffs to 60% or more on goods from China. “The prospect of a trade war looms large, not just between the U.S. and China but beyond,” Forbes markets contributor Courtney Fingar writes. Here’s what these proposed tariffs are designed to do and what they could mean for American consumers, who should be prepared for potential price hikes. A tariff is a tax on imported goods that companies pay to the government when they import products to the U.S., and that tax is usually passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. “That extra cost has to get covered one way or another, either by coming out of the importing company’s margins or by being passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices,” Forbes contributor Joe Moglia says. “If the tariffs are too high, there may be no choice other than raising prices.” The purpose of tariffs is to raise the price of foreign-produced goods, prompting consumers to purchase less-expensive domestic goods and services. Tariffs are not new for Americans. The U.S. has long used them as a tool to regulate trade with import duties that vary by product and trading partner. Ultimately, tariffs aim to protect U.S. industries from foreign competitors and raise revenue for the government. A 20% universal tariff could raise $3.3 trillion for the government from 2025 to 2034, according to the Tax Foundation. This is before factoring in the effects on the economy and any retaliatory actions by trade partners, including other countries and trade blocs like the EU. Experts believe Trump's tariffs threat is a negotiating tool to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. Trump's rationale for his proposed tariffs includes restoring manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and, some experts say, using tariffs as a trade negotiating tool. In addition to the economic motivations, Trump cites security: He has insisted that Mexico and Canada stem the flow of illegal drugs and migrants over the border. “Financial markets have not reacted thus far, because many investors view the threats as a bargaining ploy on Trump’s part,” Forbes contributor Nick Sargen writes. Here’s what Trump has proposed: Tariffs on raw materials like steel or aluminum could send the prices of cellphones and laptops through the roof, according to True Tamplin, a Forbes personal finance contributor. “For example, a 10% ad valorem tariff on a $1,000 laptop would add $100 to its price,” Tamplin writes. Your occasional Modelo or Corona beer, brewed in Mexico, could also go up, Kate Benot, the lead analyst at Sightlines told Forbes spirits contributor Don Tse. “Indirectly, they’re also likely to raise the price of beer in aggregate, even beer that’s made in the U.S. or countries not subject to tariffs,” Bernot told Tse. “If the most popular beers in the country are suddenly more expensive, it gives other producers license to increase prices as well.” Bernot said. Other goods that could become more expensive: “Industries with lots of exposure to imported goods—retail, electronics and even agriculture—could face significant headwinds,” Forbes markets contributor, Frank Holmes writes. The roots of a potential trade war go back to Trump’s first term. A report at the time showed that the U.S. was experiencing job cuts in manufacturing starting in 2001 while China was engaged in unfair trade practices, running large trade surpluses with the U.S. The U.S. also accused China of intellectual property theft —a growing risk to national security. “Over the next year and a half, the U.S. phased in tariffs on imports from China that eventually accounted for about one-half of the goods it shipped to the U.S.,” Sargen, a financial markets contributor, says. Prices rose 12% on products like washing machines and dryers, a 2019 study by the Federal Reserve Board and the University of Chicago found. And U.S. companies lost at least $1.7 trillion in market cap, according to a 2020 study by Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Columbia University. “The tariffs had an impact on U.S. company stock values because, it turns out, tariff increases are a form of industrial policy that lose money for U.S. companies and investors,” Forbes leadership contributor, Stuart Anderson wrote at the time. China and India notably retaliated against Trump’s tariffs on aluminum and steel imports in 2018, but experts believe Trump’s new tariffs could have an even more significant impact, Sargen says. China has passed laws since 2018 to better respond to U.S. tariffs and President Biden has not only kept Trump’s tariffs in place, but he has imposed additional tariffs on China. Many investors believe Trump’s tariff threat is just that Sargen says: a negotiating tactic. While tariffs can be effective in negotiations, they do risk counter-measures from the exporting country, potentially leading to job losses, price hikes and higher cost of living at home, Sargen writes. However, it’s likely that the price increases will but will not be ongoing. “Price changes that result from tariffs typically occur all at once,” Bill Conerly, Forbes leadership contributor writes. There’s also the risk of the spillover effect. Retailers importing the goods will increase the price to absorb the cost of the tariff, however, domestic producers, who aren’t impacted by the tariffs, will feel emboldened and may raise their prices too. We saw this during Trump’s first term when the price of both washers and dryers rose 12%. Washers were subjected to the tariffs, dryers were not. It’s likely that prices will go up for everyone — consumers and retailers — but it’s not guaranteed. Global retailers like Macy’s or Kroger will have to diversify sourcing options and strengthen supplier relationships through long-term contracts if they want to stay competitive in the tariff-entrenched market, Forbes retail contributor Shelley E. Kohan writes. On the other hand, vendors on sites like Amazon, Etsy and Temu have more options. As Forbes retail contributor Kiri Masters writes, the de minimis law allows direct-to-consumer platforms like Temu to potentially avoid tariffs on individual shipments up to $800 per day, while traditional retailers and sellers importing in bulk would face the full impact. The Wall Street Journal reported that retailers have already begun buying in bulk, which Kohan warns can be a huge gamble. “While some retailers have made commitments to advance the purchasing of goods from overseas sources, this can be a large outlay of capital that may not turn into planned margins but instead may lead to overstocks or excessive markdowns,” Kohan says. However, there are retailers that are looking to take advantage of other retailers' panic buying. Retailers with a secondary-brand purchase business model like TJX, the parent company of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, are looking at the tariffs as an opportunity. The company's CEO, Ernie Herrman, said during a recent earnings call that the company is hoping manufacturers will stock up ahead of the tariffs, creating a surplus of goods and lower prices. TJX purchases goods after they’ve reached the U.S., allowing it to mark down prices 20 to 60%. As you prepare for a potentially higher grocery bill and an overall higher cost of living, Forbes contributor Taylor Bauldwin suggests that you look to discount or bulk retailers, like Costco and Sam’s Club. They could be great options for groceries, appliances and electronics. Local farmer markets in some areas could also be an option for groceries. There's a caveat: As demand increases for local and seasonal shops, it could drive up those prices, too. “The rising cost of produce due to tariffs underscores how global policies can directly impact everyday expenses for consumers,” Bauldwin writes.

Title: Trump is surrounding himself with a tight-knit group of right-wing tech barons

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President-elect Donald Trump has surrounded himself with an interconnected group of tech barons. President-elect Donald Trump has surrounded himself with a tight-knit group of wealthy tech barons whose ideas will help define his second term in the White House. Three key allies — members of a group known as “the PayPal Mafia” for their involvement in the money-transfer company two decades ago — seem to be shaping policy and staffing decisions in Trump’s incoming administration, and they are part of an expansive right-wing tech network that will accompany Trump back into power. The network is highly interconnected, sharing not only a political alliance but also social ties, investment opportunities, anti-regulatory ideas and geographic proximity in Austin, Texas, or Northern California. Some of their friendships and professional connections go back decades, and almost all the members of the network are men. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has been called the “shadow president” or “first buddy,” and he wants to take a hatchet to the federal budget at Trump’s request as co-lead of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” with biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. David Sacks, a tech investor and podcaster, will have the role of Trump’s tech “czar,” advising him on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Peter Thiel, a longtime Trump supporter, has given the incoming Trump administration a staffing pipeline filled with at least 10 of his former co-workers, employees or investing partners — including Vice President-elect JD Vance. And dozens of other tech figures are now orbiting in Trump’s gravity, as either informal advisers, government officials-in-waiting or supporters pushing Trump’s agenda from outside Washington. While some converted to his side only recently, many of the tech figures know one another very well. “They’ve turned profits into power,” said Rob Lalka, author of the book “The Venture Alchemists,” which came out this year and profiled many of the figures who are headed into the administration. Lalka, a professor at Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business, said several characteristics define the technologists surrounding Trump, including their wealth and skepticism of institutions and the heavily online personas they’ve created. And he said they have a shared history, with many of them overlapping at Stanford University during and after Thiel’s time there. “That contrarianism, it doesn’t come out of nowhere. It comes from real-life experiences they had as college students,” he said. In other words: A right-wing faction has coalesced within the usually progressive tech industry, and much of it is preparing to make Washington a second home for the next four years. The Trump transition team describes it as a natural fit. “President Trump’s agenda includes economic, energy and regulatory policies that will allow the US to reclaim its global dominance of innovation and technology,” Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the transition, said in a statement. “President Trump is surrounding himself with industry leaders like Elon Musk as he works to restore innovation, reduce regulation, and celebrate free speech in his second term,” he said. Musk, Sacks and Thiel didn’t respond to requests for comment on the transition. Neil Malhotra, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, said it’s notable that many in the tech industry crowd that’s close to Trump don’t come from the biggest-name tech companies, such as Meta, Google, Apple and Microsoft. “This specific group is unique because it’s coming a lot from venture,” he said, referring to venture capitalists who invest in startups. “Venture is very different from Big Seven incumbent tech. The Big Seven incumbent tech, those people are trying to be very neutral.” The Magnificent 7 collection of tech companies includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla. Venture capitalists often are less interested in corporate initiatives such as diversity programs, he said. Instead, they have a reputation for ruthless competition, focusing in their most extreme moments on growth at all costs and upending the existing order. “The contrarian culture of Silicon Valley and venture has pushed back against big corporate ideas coming out of the professional managerial class,” he said. Trump’s second term won’t be the first administration to have strong influence from the modern tech industry. The Obama administration was closely tied to tech, especially to Google and its executives, such as former CEO Eric Schmidt. But there’s little overlap between the tech figures who advised President Barack Obama and those working now for Trump. And there’s a different dynamic this time around, said Nathan Leamer, a Republican consultant in Washington and CEO of Fixed Gear Strategies. “Obama was following Big Tech’s lead in 2008, and there was an excitement that the Obama administration’s approach to tech mirrored the blogosphere and early Twitter and how these companies saw themselves as fitting into the world,” he said. “The difference now is that, with Trump, it’s following the Republican Party’s lead,” he said. “Tech is watching Republican leaders and realizing that they have to get in the game. Otherwise, they’re going to be left out.” Previously Trump-skeptical tech companies such as Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are each giving at least $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, donations that Trump can use for whatever purpose he wants. Setting a tone near the top of the new administration will be Vance, who worked for one of Thiel’s venture capital funds, Mithril Capital, after law school and has benefited ever since from the association. Thiel was one of the main backers of Vance’s run for the Senate in Ohio in 2022. “From the top, you see that connection with Silicon Valley,” Leamer said. (He noted that Trump himself now qualifies as a tech investor, with a majority stake in the parent company of Truth Social, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.) Leamer said that while some industries rely on Washington-based trade and lobbying organizations to be the faces of their businesses, figures such as Musk, Sacks and Thiel pursue a different model: cutting out the trade groups as middlemen and speaking directly to large audiences through social media and podcasts. “These are the people behind the microphone,” he said. “It’s fitting that these very famous people are now disintermediating the marketplace.” Trump’s choices for Cabinet-level nominations are generally people from political backgrounds, including members of Congress, Republican governors and campaign loyalists. But just below that level, tech figures are populating some of the most important positions. Jacob Helberg, an adviser to the government contractor Palantir Technologies and the husband of another ex-PayPal executive, Keith Rabois, is Trump’s pick for undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment. A tech investor, Trae Stephens, a co-founder of the defense contractor Anduril and a partner at Thiel’s Founders Fund, has been under consideration for Defense Department jobs, according to Politico and The Wall Street Journal. Jim O’Neill, former CEO of the Thiel Foundation, is Trump’s choice for the No. 2 job at the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump has named Emil Michael, a former Uber executive, for the Pentagon’s top research job. Vance’s economic adviser Gail Slater, who has worked for Fox Corp., Roku and a now-defunct trade group called the Internet Association, is Trump’s choice to lead antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department. Announcing his choice of Slater on Truth Social, Trump highlighted the conflicts between large incumbent tech firms and the tech startups that have venture capitalists’ backing: “Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!” Trump has also designated appointees friendly to the same tech faction to lead the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. But there are hundreds or thousands of potential appointments still to come in the middle levels of the bureaucracy where other tech figures could end up. Vance said in a 2021 podcast interview that if Trump were to win another term, he should replace all federal civil servants with “our people,” meaning conservatives. Lalka, of Tulane University, said that for all the rhetoric about meritocracy coming from right-leaning tech entrepreneurs and investors, Vance’s vision for the federal workforce is more like the opposite. “That is literally ‘to the victor go the spoils’ from the 19th century,” he said. “It’s not how you attract top talent.” Malhotra, of Stanford, said one outstanding question is how many tech figures will take full-time jobs in government rather than part-time ones. Sacks’ White House role, for example, is expected to be part-time only, and Musk’s task of co-leading an efficiency commission also won’t be his day job. “That’s going to really limit their power,” he said of the part-time roles. “This is a really good way for Trump to marginalize these people and give them the facade that they’re powerful.” Despite his part-time role, though, Musk has lately left his imprint on the transition by helping block a government funding bill and globe-trotting with Trump to meet foreign leaders. There’s a long list of actions that Trump’s tech appointees are expected to tackle, including deregulation of the cryptocurrency industry, fewer constraints on artificial intelligence development, easier environmental approval for projects such as Musk’s SpaceX rocket launches, a shakeup in antitrust enforcement, an overhaul of military procurement and, with congressional approval, low tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals. Adam Kovacevich, the CEO of Chamber of Progress, a Democratic tech industry organization, said that despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump in November, he’s trying to see potential upside for tech overall in part because of who’s advising Trump. “You have to go into the new administration with optimism,” he said. “A lot of these people who have supported Trump, they’ve supported Democrats in the past, so we’re not necessarily talking about people who are always in the Republican corner,” he said. Tech figures in that category include Musk, Sacks and investor Marc Andreessen, who recently said he’s spending half his time at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida advising on the transition. Kovacevich said he believes their alliance with Trump is best thought of as a narrow reaction against President Joe Biden, a longtime skeptic of the tech industry, rather than a complete rejection of Democratic politics. Kovacevich said he thinks Trump won’t be able to follow through on some of his most radical ideas about technology, including forcing social media platforms to further bend their content moderation in favor of conservative users. “Any efforts there will probably run into a First Amendment buzzsaw,” he said. One closely watched question: How much money will Trump’s tech allies make during his administration? Musk’s wealth has soared 70% since last month’s election, to about $450 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — fueling progressive theories that he and others in tech are motivated by a desire to increase their net worth. The stock price of Palantir Technologies, a government contractor, has roughly doubled since the election, and defense tech startup firms such as Anduril have also expressed optimism about increased sales during the new administration. Leamer, the Republican consultant, said he thinks Trump’s tech allies have a different motivation: to prove that they’re right. “I think they see it as a chance to put their ideas into practice,” he said. “These individuals have been thinking about these ideas, and they really have an interest in entrepreneurship and the future of the country.” CORRECTION (Dec. 26, 2024, 1:00 p.m. ET): A diagram in a previous version of this article included a wrong photo.

Title: AI is expected to fuel Wall Street's tech hiring in 2025. Headhunters break down what you need to know to get a leg up.

It's been a tough year for software engineers on the job market, but one bright spot is starting to emerge on Wall Street for technologists looking for a new gig. Banks, hedge funds, and investment firms bullish on AI are expected to hire more tech talent in the new year, according to two headhunters who recruit engineers and data scientists for finance firms. That's good news for jobseekers in these sectors, which were long considered to be recession-proof careers but were hit this year with waves of layoffs, job freezes, and hiring cutbacks. Ben Hodzic, a managing director at recruitment firm Selby Jennings who finds talent for hedge funds and investment banks, told Business Insider there's "a lot of optimism" around AI in financial services. "Financial services institutions are slowly adopting their workflows and they've come to a reality where you need the right talent to actually build and implement and manage those products," he said. In some cases, the hiring spree is already happening. Jamie Dimon, the boss of America's biggest bank JPMorgan Chase, said earlier this year that he's anticipating adding thousands of jobs related to AI in the next few years. Hedge fund and proprietary-trading firms are shelling out as much as $350,000 in annual salaries for top-tier AI researchers and engineers. Meanwhile, private-equity firms have been "clamoring" to hire AI operating executives to improve their portfolio companies. Hodzic said the rosier outlook stems from a desire to build AI tools in-house and boost worker productivity in areas like wealth advisory, investment banking, and trading. More clarity on the direction of macroeconomic factors, like inflation and the impacts of the US election, is also providing tailwinds for banks looking to invest in human capital in 2025, he said. While AI is expected to drive an uptick in tech hiring, the technology is also changing what it takes to get a tech job on Wall Street. BI spoke with recruiters to find out how candidates should adapt and what they need to do to stand out. They outlined some of the industry's most in-demand skills, explained why having Big Tech experience might not get you that far anymore, and shared the companies that hiring managers want to see on resumes. They declined to disclose specific client activity due to privacy agreements. A few years ago, Matt Stabile, a tech recruiter who works with buy-side firms including Two Sigma and Susquehanna International Group, could almost guarantee an interview with a hiring manager if a candidate was coming out of a FAANG company. "Now, due to overhiring and layoffs, those resumes seem to be a dime a dozen," Stabile told BI. It's true that Big Tech companies have shed thousands of workers this year, flooding the job market with resumes touting the same companies, like Meta and Amazon. And only certain divisions of Big Tech companies on a resume will catch hiring managers' eyes, like Google's DeepMind, for instance, Stabile said. Finance firms witnessing the AI transformation from the sidelines want to get in on the action and build their own homegrown solutions. That's created demand among hedge-fund clients to ask for technologists specifically from Nvidia, Hodzic told BI. "There's definitely an inherent need for people to understand the infrastructure side as well, how to actually construct the computer in the right way to be able to process some of this information and what quality of chips are needed in order to actually produce the output they're looking for," Hodzic said. Stabile is seeing the same, with hiring managers getting excited to see talent coming from the $3.6 trillion chipmaker, AI startup Anthropic, and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. He said these are the resumes that are getting through and being considered over all the others. Even if you haven't worked at any of these companies, Stabile said experience and exposure to their software tools is still a highly sought after skill. He specifically highlighted the Nvidia Triton Inference Server, an open-source software that's key to deploying and executing AI workloads, Nvidia TensorRT-LLM, used to optimize the performance of large language models, and Nvidia Fleet Command, which is important for scaling AI deployments. If you haven't worked at a large AI company, or haven't worked with their latest products, not all hope is lost. Wall Street banks especially rely heavily on legacy technologies. Some are built on codebases that have likely been around longer than the developer working on it has been alive. To be clear, that hasn't stopped financial firms from building entire businesses and offerings on modern technology. What that has introduced, however, is the need to ensure that systems old and new can work together and exist in the same environment without introducing bugs or dependency issues. And in the case of firms moving on-premise systems to the public cloud, sometimes entire back-end systems have to be rebuilt. As a result, hiring managers often light up when candidates can talk about their experience with software migrations, Selby Jennings' Hodzic said. If you've shifted data or software from one system to another, or translated code from one language to another, be sure to bring it up during the interview process. "People who can demonstrate that engineering skillset of recreating and reconstructing things are really sought after," Hodzic said. "I think what a lot of clients want are people who can come in and show them what's not working well, how to iterate and how to improve, and then actually do it." Jump to

Title: RICH BODY

. For example ,,, ￼ you would not want to be the world’s most muscular and glorious demigod body if you only got two hours of sleep a night, and felt like you were physiologically dying, and had very low testosterone. ￼ Similarly speaking, it wouldn’t matter if you were like the worlds strongest man, you could lift like 100,000 pounds or whatever, but, once again, you had naturally low mood, low testosterone, and once again only slept two hours a night? So one random thought I have in regards to fitness is the criticality of sleep and recovery. For example, I think I have a simple antidote, to reset your circadian rhythm, or sleep patterns, for dinner, the night prior, eat a shit load of beef ribs. Why beef ribs? First, ancient Greek literature, the Iliad confirms this. ￼￼ For example, when Achilles had his friends joined him in his hut, he carved out the backbone of the ox, often prized, the most choice meat. Also, it is easily accessible, you could find it at any Costco, even Food 4 Less. Even with the price of inflation, it is still affordable, around 499 a pound, or 449 a pound. I found a very very simple recipe, just take a baking tray and cover it with aluminum foil, and you don’t even have to season the ribs or prepare them, just put them directly on the aluminum foil, heat the oven at 325°, let it cook for an hour and a half, and boom you’re done! And then later you could just coat it with some salt pepper and garlic powder, and smoked paprika is actually good too. Anyways, after consuming about two trays of beef ribs, I’ve been sleeping way better, like on average another two or three hours a night, which I feel at least 500% better in the morning? The weird idea is in a lot of self improvement circles is that waking up super early every day, at like 3:30 AM or for whatever is considered virtuous. No. I would actually say that the ultimate virtue and active mainlines is to try to secure at least 8 to 12 hours of sleep a night. Why? Simple biology; assuming that during the day you are doing some sort of physical exercise and weightlifting, then what that then means is that the corresponding rest and recovery time will also be in similar accordance. Also, a simple thoughts; the stronger you become the heavier way to lift, you must also correspondingly spend equal amounts of time stretching, warming up etc. For example on the road to hitting my legendary thousand pound Atlas lift, all of these low testosterone guys would always tell me ￼“be careful”, which was their strange way of trying to feel superior to me that they thought I was doing something foolish in which I actually might injure myself? The simple idea that I have is once again, obviously! The higher weight you go, the more careful you become. And my personal way of mitigating safety was simple; spending at least two or three times more effort stretching warming up, doing dynamic exercise exercises like a bunch of yoga stuff on steroids. And this is where a lot of fools also don’t understand; when that would be warming up for my really really heavy weight lifts, I would also do a lot of calisthenics that looks like I would just do a single muscle up to warm up, planches etc. ￼ So currently my practical thought is the best car or vehicle to own in LA, maybe anywhere in Southern California, maybe even America is probably a white Toyota plug-in Prius prime. Why? First, once again you want to have the best of all worlds! For example, when you become dumb rich, it ain’t about showing off, rather, it is about adding more convenience to your life. For example, you want maximum optionality. What that means is you want to have access to gasoline pumps when necessary, and also you want to have access to electric charging ports when also available. But you don’t want to be dependent on either. ￼ Once again, do you want to have the optional not the dependence. So I just finished reading principles of economics by Saifedean, and one really really fascinating idea I encountered is this idea that perhaps, what if a lot of these doomsday Colts were simply predicated on false science math and philosophical principles? For example, just ChatGPT; what percentage of the earths crust has been mined for oil, and it will spit out an absurdly tiny number. Also all this hysteria when it comes to carbon dioxide and carbon footprint whatever; also once again, just ChatGPT the percentage of carbon in the earths atmosphere, compared to nitrogen which is about 70%, oxygen which is about 20%, and carbon which I think is like .01%? Anyways, I think the biggest issue here is that almost 99.9999% of all these doomsday cults is that once again, the world is going to shit, and it is precisely because we are boiling the earth, carbon footprint, running out of oil etc. But what if I could tell you, that with 100% certainty that human beings will be fine for the next hundred million years on planet earth, and even at the rate we are going, we have only tapped .001% of the earths natural gas and oil supply, in that, we would never run out of natural minerals even for the next hundred billion years? Certainly I cannot make this prediction but this is a thought experiment. If this were the case, then what? ￼￼ anyways, the reason why I think this is important is that even though I am 100% fan of Tesla Elon Musk, the truth is, getting an electric vehicle or a Tesla is more about fashion rather than saving the planet or whatever. Even an ancient Taoist philosophy says this; How dare you have the audacity to think that somehow the planet needs your help? I think there are virtues to arrogance, but also, the arrogant line of thinking that somehow the Earth needs our help, is also an arrogant thought? Sandbox thinking So currently I really really like this idea of a sandbox. The general idea is that what if we lived in the world in which we had unlimited time unlimited resources, essentially god mode, then how would we proceeded and live life? ￼￼ first, I think 99.9999% of the current modern-day misery that most humans face is body poverty. It don’t matter if you make seven figures or eight figures at Google, at Apple, Meta or Facebook whatever; it seems that almost all these people that I know who work in tech, all of them have extreme bodily poverty? Once again, not enough time weightlifting, too much time jerking off to VR porn, or going on Reddit late at night, with incognito browser on, or their VPN on with pirate bay, whatever it may be. Also, not enough meat consumption. All of these bizarre virtues signaling folks with plant-based diets whatever. Also once again, this anti-sleep mentality, the strange idea that sleeping is a vice? I find everybody on all sides of the political spectrum bad. Republicans and Democrats are bad, Libertarians are bad, moderates are bad etc. The left the right the alt left the alt right whatever. ￼ I don’t know any independent thinkers. All thinkers are dependent on others, nobody stands on their own two feet. I think currently the only independent thinkers that I appreciate and love include Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos, Michael Saylor, NASSIM Taleb etc. But once again, these individuals are good role models but not the end in itself. For example you could spend 100,000 years studying Elon Musk but the truth of the matter is you do not want to become Elon Musk. Why? The critical issue here is he has extreme body poverty until you see him topless on a yacht, with a golden bronze tan, and a six pack, don’t follow him. In some ways Jeff Bezos might be a better guide, look at him, he’s so fucking jacked. But then again I’m pretty sure that Bezos is on the juice, I’m sure he trains good, but he also does steroids good. Michael Saylor is a good example, he knows the virtues of intermittent fasting, and at the age of 59 he looks great! But I also think that maybe he could get into weightlifting; I want to see a sleeveless Michael Saylor with huge guns. MSTR FOLKS email me at Eric@erickim.com for tips So some simple training ideas: First, killing 10 birds with one stone. What that means is just go on a morning walk around town, with your 60 pound weight vest on! Titan.fitness is good ￼ Also, a very simple thing you could do is just get those wooden gymnast rings, you get on Amazon or Titan fitness, and just hook it up in your garage or backyard your front lawn, on a tree, your parking spot whatever ,,, and with your 60 pound weighted vest on, just do a few ups dips, “skin the cat”, Essentially an exercise in which you’re holding the rings you do kind of a backflip and un backflip it again, planches etc. ￼ Currently I think actually one of the most underrated exercises is the rack pull. Essentially, you rack your barbell at around waist level, and then you load it up with weights, and then you kind of do like a mini hip thrust, and you just get it off the rack for like half an inch and you’re done. Imagine like doing like a super mini deadlift, but it is far superior because you don’t have to deal with racking and unracking the weights annoyingly off the floor, and also, the transfer injury is almost nailed because there is not much load on your lower back. A rack pull is more like a hip thrust, meets thigh exercise, meets upper back and trap exercise? ￼ Another very simple one is the Atlas lift, once again, you don’t have to squat all the way down. You just rack up the weight, like you’re doing a squad, and the only goal is to just lift it up half an inch. For the fools who say this don’t do nothing, I have like the most insanely jacked legs thighs calves quads of all time and once again I’m not on steroids. It don’t matter if they are vegan plant-based, professional or whatever, everyone is on steroids! Even your favorite vegan power lifter and weightlifter is on steroids! Even your favorite yoga instructor or calisthenics or CrossFit instructor is also on steroids. Note, steroids are vegan! Ha ha. My massage therapist Aaron at massage envy in Beverly Hills, 100% recommended, told me something interesting that all body mechanics are pretty much the same, but the only difference is our levels of fitness. Also he encouraged me that because I am so physically active, to once again, the more physically active you become, the more time you must also dedicate to stretching mobility work etc. As an investor, you need to have big balls and high testosterone, good mood, good sleep, good physiological and mental health. The primary issue is that a lot of these degenerate traders, have very very poor physical and physiological health. If you’re checking prices like 100 times a day, this is bad. I would actually make the argument if you’re like a single person, and assuming that you’re trading bitcoin and investing a micro strategy stock whatever, the intelligence strategy is if you want to get your mind off things, invest in your physical fitness and health 10x. What that then means is like spend maximum time outside, outdoors, walking outside in the elements, go on nice hikes, be a nature, spend some time with the gym or weightlifting at home, essentially embrace a natural lifestyle. Also, quit marijuana, alcohol. These are all bad toxins. Just be sober. Just be focused on one thing at a time? When is future forecasting good and when is it bad?

An interview with Ashley Smith about the rise of capitalist China by Thomas Hummel Thomas Hummel: First of all, congratulations on getting this book out. The book covers several key themes: the rise of capitalism in China, class struggle, China’s place in the new world of inter-imperialist rivalry and crisis, and the possibilities for international working-class solidarity. Why do you think this book is so important at this moment in world politics? Ashley Smith: I believe the starting point for any discussion of world politics today is the state of global capitalism, which I think is in its greatest period of crisis since the 1970s, and possibly since the 1930s. While it’s not on the scale of the Great Depression, since the Great Recession, we’ve been in what David McNally has referred to as “a long global slump.” Michael Roberts calls it a “long depression.” This crisis is interwoven with other systemic crises, the most obvious being the climate crisis, the migration crisis—which stems from the Great Recession, climate change, and other large-scale issues—and the rising levels of interstate conflict, inter-imperial rivalry, and war. These factors are driving millions of people to move across the globe. On top of this, we’re seeing the return of pandemics. COVID-19 is just one of many to come, given the world’s increasing integration and the zoonotic spillover of diseases from animals to humans. This is happening with growing regularity. So, we are dealing with multiple, overlapping crises of global capitalism that are creating unprecedented struggles from below in nearly every state around the world. Over the past 15 years, we’ve seen massive uprisings of people across the globe. At the same time, these crises have intensified inter-imperial rivalries and interstate conflicts, leading to an increasing number of wars, both between states and within states in the form of civil wars. There are thus two axes of conflict in the world: one between capitalist states, and the other between those states and the workers, peoples, and nations they exploit and oppress. Our epoch’s central inter-imperial conflict is between the United States and China. This conflict is the top priority for both the U.S. and Chinese states, and it’s leading them to produce symmetrically opposed policies—economic, political, and military—as their rivalry intensifies and plays out globally. At the same time, both the U.S. and China are experiencing growing struggles from below, as oppressed and exploited people become fed up with their own ruling classes. In this conjuncture, the Left is really being put to the test. The challenge is whether we can oppose both these powers and the inter-imperial rivalry they are locked in while also supporting and building solidarity with the struggles from below in both countries. This book was written in that spirit: as an attempt to offer an alternative of anti-imperialist internationalism and solidarity from below against the escalating inter-imperial rivalry between the U.S. and China. TH: Many on the Left consider China and its so-called “socialist” system to be an alternative to the American-dominated world system. Can you speak a little bit about why you believe this is not true? AS: I think you have to start by understanding why people would be looking for an alternative to the U.S., because as we know, it has been the hegemonic imperialist power in the 20th and 21st centuries. It has the largest economy, the largest military force, with 800 bases around the world, the most developed set of imperial alliance structures, and it’s the main enemy of liberation struggles in almost every part of the world. So, it’s completely understandable that people repulsed by U.S. imperialism would seek some kind of alternative—some state that stands up to the U.S. and offers an alternative to its vicious capitalist and imperialist policies. But I don’t think China or any other state offers any real alternative. The book goes into this in detail, as do many other works. First and foremost, China is a capitalist state that oversees a capitalist economy. Its state and private corporations are thoroughly integrated into the world system. It used this integration with the world system to transform itself from an isolated, marginal economy in the 1970s into the second-largest capitalist economy today. It is the world’s largest manufacturer and not just in low-end commodities. Its “China 2025” plan is designed to leap ahead in high-tech industries, challenging the U.S., Europe, and Japan in research, development, and production. China is now leading in key innovations like green technology and electric vehicles, while also becoming more self-sufficient in critical industries like microchip production. With this massive capitalist expansion, there has been an enormous concentration of wealth in the hands of China’s ruling class. It has the second-highest number of billionaires, after the U.S., and its Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, is on par with that of the U.S. All the wealth and massive economic expansion we’ve seen in China is based on the exploitation of working-class people, especially the migrant labor force, which has been pushed out of the countryside into the vast factories of both Chinese and multinational capital. They make everything from electric vehicles for Chinese corporations to iPhones for Apple. They work in what can only be called giant sweatshops policed by the Chinese state. Exploitation is at the heart of the vast growth of the Chinese economy. As with any capitalist power, this expansion has been accompanied with all sorts of oppression. China holds Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong under national oppression within its self-proclaimed borders. It is a regional power, threatening Taiwan with invasion. China is also very aggressive in the South China Sea, claiming large sections as its own and coming into conflict with smaller powers in the region, like the Philippines, and, of course, with the United States. China’s development as a capitalist power has transformed it into a rising imperialist power. Economically, it’s one of the largest exporters of capital globally, particularly through its Belt and Road Initiative—a massive trillion-dollar investment project aimed not at helping other countries, but at securing raw materials to fuel China’s economic expansion. Additionally, China is building a rival axis to the U.S.-led alliance structures, especially with Russia, with which it has a deep economic and geopolitical alliance, but also with regional powers like Iran. It participates in organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS, and others. To back up this economic and geopolitical power, China has dramatically modernized its military. It now has the second-largest military budget in the world, an increasingly powerful navy and airforce, and a growing stockpile of advanced missiles, including the third-largest stash of nuclear ones after Russia and the U.S. Thus, China is an imperialist power competing with the U.S. on multiple fronts: economic, geopolitical, and military. It along with Russia and their allies advocates for a new multipolar world order. This order would allow China to assert its economic, geopolitical, and military interests on a global scale. Some see this development as a positive shift from the unipolarity dominated by the U.S. since the end of the Cold War towards a more multipolar world. On the surface, that might seem convincing because unipolarity under the U.S. has been horrific, with Washington’s countless wars and acts of state terror against people around the world to enforce its previously unrivaled hegemony over global capitalism. But multipolarity is no solution. Remember the last great era of multipolarity, in the late 19th and 20th centuries, led to the scramble to divide the world up into colonies, two world wars, and with all that the death of hundreds of millions of people. So, while unipolarity is bad, multipolarity is not a solution and, with the real possibility of inter-imperial war, it could, in fact, be worse. TH: The image presented in Western media of the people of China is that they passively accept a dictatorial regime. Your book draws out the rich history of social and class struggle in China since the reforms of Deng Xiaoping. Can you speak a little bit on this and its importance? AS: First, it is profoundly orientalist to depict Chinese people as passively accepting exploitation and oppression. In reality, just like in any capitalist country, when there’s exploitation and oppression, there’s always going to be resistance. With the rise of China as a capitalist and imperialist power, we’ve seen a dramatic intensification of class exploitation, national oppression, and other forms of oppression related to gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and more. Along with that has come a rise in various forms of resistance—class and social resistance—over the last few decades. The first wave of this resistance came in response to China’s restructuring of state-owned industries. Just like the Rust Belt workers in the U.S. in the 1970s and 80s, China’s old industrial working class tried to resist closures and layoffs with massive strikes in the 1990s. Although many of these were defeated, they didn’t extinguish class struggle in China. In fact, with the rise of new industries in the special economic zones and the influx of multinational capitalist investment—along with new Chinese state and private investment—a new layer of workers engaged in militant forms of class struggle, especially from the late 1990s through the 2000s. This wave of struggle was largely driven by the huge migrant labor force of about 300 million people who left the countryside to work in the new industries. These struggles were radical, happening both outside and inside the state-controlled unions, with migrant workers fighting for better wages and working conditions. But these struggles didn’t just take place in the workplaces. There was also significant resistance over land rights, as China underwent one of the most rapid rates of urbanization in world history. The state seized and sold off people’s land to real estate capitalists to build vast new cities. People rose up to resist the state’s land grabs, triggering ongoing conflicts over land and land rights. There have also been other forms of resistance, including struggles against national oppression. There’s been resistance in Tibet against the national oppression of Tibetans, and similar resistance by Uyghurs against the horrific cultural genocide being carried out by the Chinese state in Xinjiang. There have been massive uprisings in Hong Kong that were brutally put down by the Chinese state. Additionally, there’s been feminist resistance against the increasing oppression of women in China. Another significant development is the return of demonstrations and strikes in the last couple of years, largely triggered by China’s zero-COVID policy during the pandemic. China locked down entire cities, forcing people to stay in their apartment buildings for months, sometimes for over 100 days. The state also implemented “closed-loop management,” which locked workers inside factories to keep them producing commodities amidst the pandemic. The lockdown didn’t eliminate COVID, especially the omicron strain which started to spread throughout the country and in workplaces. The state’s policy led to tremendous struggles. Outside the workplace, one of the key events was a horrific fire in Urumqi, Xinjiang, where an entire apartment block burned down, killing many people—mainly Uyghurs—who were locked inside. This sparked nationwide protests called the White Paper Movement. At the same time, there were massive workplace struggles against the closed-loop management system, which resulted in physical confrontations between workers and company security forces and the police. One of the largest strikes happened in an Apple manufacturing hub, where workers rebelled against being locked in the factory while the virus spread inside. Ultimately, the Chinese government abandoned Zero-COVID, letting the virus rip through society to achieve herd immunity, sickening and killing unknown numbers of people. All these struggles show that there is massive resistance against class exploitation, social inequalities, national oppression, and the brutal policies of China’s capitalist state. TH: China’s commitment to dominating emerging green sectors like renewables and electric vehicles seems to align with the government’s stated goals of achieving environmental sustainability. Why shouldn’t we take these commitments at face value? AS: First of all, we should reject the lies and hypocrisy coming from the U.S., European states, and Japan among many others that claim they’re serious about mitigating climate change and transitioning away from fossil fuels. They’re all lying. Adam Hanieh’s new book Crude Capitalism explains this in great detail. Europe, the US, and Japan are the historical culprits responsible for the climate crisis. Their claims about addressing climate change have consistently been proven false. All of these Western powers are currently engaged in massive fossil fuel expansion. In fact, the U.S. saw its largest extraction of fossil fuel in history last year. Hanieh points out that the development of green technologies has gone hand-in-hand with the expansion of fossil fuel extraction. The two are not separate; green investment isn’t stopping the growth of fossil fuels—it’s happening alongside it. So, while we see major investments in things like electric vehicles, the rate of fossil fuel extraction continues to rise, as do greenhouse gas emissions, which means climate change is getting worse. We’re hitting critical tipping points for environmental disaster, yet the Western powers keep insisting they’re leading the charge against climate change. It’s all lies. As for China, I would argue it’s no different. It’s not a special case; it’s not uniquely bad compared to these historical polluters. It’s just part of the same system—capitalism—that is the fundamental cause of climate change. China has just become the new epicenter of global capitalism’s environmental destruction. This isn’t a China-specific problem, but a problem of the system. Like other states, China is lying about its commitment to the environment. At the same time that it’s investing in green technologies, it’s also massively expanding its fossil fuel industry. In 2023, it was reported that over the previous seven years, China built more coal plants than any other country in the world. In fact, new coal plants are being built at a rate of about two per day. China continues to invest in coal because it needs the energy to fuel its industrial growth, and so far, investments in green technologies like solar haven’t been able to replace coal and other fossil fuels as China’s main energy source. In fact, China is also the world’s largest importer of oil and natural gas and the biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses. So, it’s just as dirty a fossil capitalist as the other great powers. So, why is China investing so heavily in green tech? The reason is simple: it’s a growth sector. That’s why all the great powers and capitalists are investing in it—not to replace fossil fuels, but to profit from this new sector. China has invested enormous amounts of capital into producing electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries. It also controls a large share of the rare earth minerals that are critical to solar and battery manufacturing. But like capitalists everywhere, China has overinvested in green industries, creating a huge glut of factories and commodities. Because of its cheap labor, China can undercut the prices of other countries’ electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturers and dump their products into their markets. That has led to a classic protectionist response from the U.S., the EU, Japan, and others as they try to shield their own investments in these industries. The bottom line is that none of these powers are genuinely “green.” They’re all dirty. They’re all expanding their fossil fuel industries while simultaneously investing in green tech for profit, not to mitigate climate change. TH: In the book, you define the rivalry between the U.S. and China as essential to understanding the dynamics of the modern world system. Can you expand on the core tensions between these two states and the potential outcomes of their conflict? AS: First, it’s important to understand the fundamentals. Capitalism produces imperialism. Inter-state and inter-imperialist rivalry is built into the DNA of capitalism. Imperialism isn’t just a policy decision made by this or that government to project economic or geopolitical power. It’s actually a structural result of capitalist competition. National capitals turn to their respective states to protect and project their interests globally. This competition leads states into competition, including armed conflict, over geopolitical hegemony and the division and redivision of the global market. This imperial struggle for dominance has created unstable imperial orders that change over time. We’ve thus seen a sequence of imperial orders: from the multipolar rivalry of the late 19th century, which caused World Wars I and II to the Cold War’s bipolar order, the unipolar moment after the fall of the Soviet bloc, and today’s asymmetric multipolar world order where the central rivalry is between the U.S. and China. As I’ve laid out, China is attempting to assert itself as an imperial power and rival to the US for the division of the world market. The U.S. has responded to the rise of China in ways we’ve seen historically from other hegemonic powers faced with new rivals. It has tried to shore up its dominance and contain and confront its challengers. Before China’s rise, the U.S. had sought to avoid the emergence of a peer competitor with a strategy of superintending global capitalism. But it failed. As a result, the U.S. has adopted a new strategy of great power competition, using classic tactics seen throughout the history of imperialism: economic protectionism, rallying allies to contain its rising rivals, and bolstering its military power. Under the Trump and Biden administrations, the U.S. has mainly focussed mainly on confronting and containing China. This has involved shoring up old alliances like NATO and forming new alliances like the Quad (with Japan, India, and Australia) and the AUKUS pact (with Australia and the UK). Thus, what we’re seeing is classic inter-imperial rivalry playing out across economic, geopolitical, and military dimensions. But this doesn’t mean we’re inevitably headed toward another world war. There are several mitigating factors today that prevent the rivalry from escalating into a full-scale global conflict. For one, the U.S. and China are deeply economically integrated. It’s hard to imagine a product like the iPhone existing without Chinese plants, for example. This integration decreases the likelihood of outright military conflict, as both economies would suffer tremendous costs. However, this interdependence is gradually being unraveled as the U.S. and its corporations seek alternative bases for manufacturing in other parts of the world. Another mitigating factor is the fact that both powers possess nuclear weapons, which they are both expanding and modernizing to ensure greater effectiveness and lethality. So, any conflict between them risks mutually assured destruction (MAD), something that deterred the two great powers during the Cold War from engaging in direct military conflict. Of course, that didn’t rule out their going to war as they nearly did during the Cuban Missile Crisis. These factors do not entirely eliminate the risk of conflict. We didn’t expect to see a large-scale war in Europe, yet Russia launched one with its imperialist invasion of Ukraine. Similarly, a potential flashpoint like Taiwan could trigger a conflict between the U.S. and China, given the high stakes economically and geopolitically. The risk is very real. TH: What does this rivalry and the new dynamics of global capitalism mean for U.S. allies, like the EU and the Spanish state? AS: I touched on this a bit in my previous answer regarding the nature of the rivalry. The key thing to understand is that with the U.S. shift towards great power competition, it’s attempting to bring together all of its historic allies as vassals in its conflict with China. The U.S. is applying heavy pressure on Europe—both through economic institutions like the European Union and military institutions like NATO—to side with it against China. One of the ways the U.S. is doing this is by turning to protectionism, especially in high-tech sectors. They describe it as a “high fence around a small yard,” but that yard keeps expanding, and more and more industries are being protected from Chinese competition—particularly those with military applications. Microchips are a prime example, as they’re critical components in everything from cars to military aircraft like the F-35 fighter jet. Whoever controls the capacity to make microchips, controls large parts of military and surveillance technologies, including artificial intelligence. So the U.S. is building a protectionist barrier around these strategic industries, and it’s pushing the EU to do the same—blocking the export of technology like microchips and the lasers used to manufacture them to China. They’re also trying to prevent the sale of Chinese electric vehicles under the guise of national security, claiming that China could use them to track people’s behavior. Additionally, the U.S. is exerting pressure on EU states to stay out of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. In short, the U.S. wants its allies to adopt the same economic protectionism that it has in place against China. This puts European capital, especially German capital, in a profound economic dilemma. It depends on exports to China, but now faces competition with it, especially in electric vehicles. But if it adopts protectionism, it risks China retaliating and closing off its vital export market. On the military front, the U.S. is pressuring Europe to line up with its military containment of China’s rise. For example, it has pressured NATO—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—to identify China as a strategic concern and start focusing on the Indo-Pacific region. Essentially, the U.S. is weaponizing NATO against China, and the U.S. will continue to pressure all its allies—including the Spanish state—to align with its strategy economically, militarily, and geopolitically. That pressure is going to be relentless, and it will play out in various, sometimes unpredictable, ways. But Spain will be no exception to this trend. TH: At the moment, the events of the greatest geopolitical consequence are happening in Gaza, and there’s now an increasingly likely possibility of a wider regional war. Could you speak on the consequences of the rivalry between the U.S. and China in this context? AS: Gaza has become the epicenter of regional and imperial conflict, but it’s not the only flashpoint. Taiwan is another, as is Ukraine, and there are other hotspots like the Philippines. These are all countries where questions of national self-determination and inter-imperial conflict intersect. The key for the Left is to support all struggles for national self-determination without exception while opposing any imperial power’s attempts to weaponize these struggles for their own purposes, which all powers will inevitably try to do. That’s the broader framework for understanding what’s happening in Gaza. The U.S. is the main sponsor—militarily, economically, and politically—of the Israeli state, which serves as its enforcer in the Middle East. The U.S. uses Israel, along with reactionary Arab states, to ensure that no Arab country or Iran challenges U.S. control over the region’s oil, which underpins the entire world economy. This means the U.S. is deeply implicated in the genocide in Gaza. It’s not just a sponsor; it’s a co-partner in the settler colonialism, apartheid, occupation, and now the genocide that Israel is carrying out. The U.S. has supported, funded, and armed Israel in its aggression in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, and Yemen. While the U.S. is the central imperial player in the region, it’s not the only one. Russia, for example, has consistently supported counterrevolution and reaction in the region. It played a key role in helping Assad crush the Syrian revolution and has maintained a close relationship with Netanyahu, with Putin and Netanyahu publicly celebrating their ties. China’s role isn’t clean either. China is mainly concerned with ensuring the flow of oil from the Middle East to fuel its economic expansion, so it has cultivated both economic and geopolitical relations with any state that can provide that fuel. China has an alliance with Iran, but it has also pushed for normalized relations between Israel and other states in the region—not out of principle, but simply because it wants stability and the oil flowing. China even brokered a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and it’s the second-largest investor in Israel. So, if you support the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions), you’d need to raise it as a demand against China and its corporations. In response to the current crisis, China has largely taken a symbolic stance. While it’s criticized U.S. support for the genocide to score political points, it has done nothing to aid the Palestinian struggle for self-determination. Any role China has played, such as hosting talks between rival Palestinian factions, has been largely symbolic. China even supports the two-state solution, which has historically been the fake solution U.S. imperialism has proposed for Palestine. Washington’s biggest concern is that its relative loss of power in the region over the last two decades is creating openings for China and Russia to play more aggressive roles in the Middle East. Israel’s expansion of its genocidal war into the region is going to intensify this dynamic, potentially disrupting the normalization deals between Israel and other Arab states and pushing states into rival blocs. You can already see an emerging axis of Russia, Iran, and China aligning against Israel and the U.S. The question now is what the Arab regimes aligned with the U.S. will do, as it’s increasingly untenable for them to openly support the U.S. amid Israel’s genocide. So, there’s a potential for interstate antagonisms to split into a bloc of the U.S. and its allies on one side, and China, Iran, and Russia on the other. But at the same time, all these powers are deeply invested in maintaining the flow of oil, so they may be hesitant to risk destabilizing the region with sharp inter-state schisms. But Israel’s aggression has opened a very unpredictable and volatile moment, and the dynamics at play are dangerous. We’re already witnessing genocide, and the expansion of that genocide into Lebanon could lead to an all-out regional war between Israel and Iran with international repercussions. TH: On that note, I think this next question becomes even more important. What do you think the tasks are for the international Left, and how can we find a way out of this current state of affairs? AS: In some ways, we’re back to the classic questions that the revolutionary Left faced at the start of the 20th century. We’re now in a situation with enormous inter-imperial antagonisms and widespread revolts from below across the globe. The Left faces a strategic question: How do we oppose all the different states—not just imperial ones, but all capitalist states—from below, and build solidarity between labor movements and movements of the oppressed in every country against all imperial powers, capitalist states, and their wars? In the U.S., the most important thing for the Left is to guard against aligning with the U.S. state and its imperial project. There’s a tendency to do that, often by those with reformist politics and an allegiance to the Democratic Party, which is currently co-partner in the genocide. Our primary obligation in the U.S. is to oppose U.S. imperialism—full stop. At the same time, we need to guard against a second temptation, which is to fall into the trap of thinking “my enemy’s enemy is my friend.” That position leads some on the Left to view Washington’s opponents as either lesser evils or even alternatives. But as I’ve discussed earlier, these so-called alternatives like China and Russia are also imperialist, capitalist states built on exploitation, oppression, and reactionary politics. Supporting another imperialist power like China betrays the class struggle and social struggles within China by siding with its state against the country’s workers and oppressed peoples. It also alienates people in the U.S. who rightly view China as a dictatorial, capitalist regime that keeps workers locked in factories amidst a pandemic. That’s no kind of alternative and claiming it is one will only isolate the Left from U.S. class and social struggles, weakening them in the process. The real alternative is to oppose all imperial powers—first and foremost the U.S., but also China—while building solidarity across borders. Today, the global system is deeply interconnected, and this presents real opportunities for such solidarity. Take the iPhone, for instance. It connects workers in Chinese factories, international shipping companies, distributors like Amazon, and retail outlets in the U.S and elsewhere. This interconnected world economy allows for the possibility of forging bonds of solidarity between workers across the globe. Additionally, we have international educational systems with Chinese students participating in campus struggles all over the world, including in the U.S., where they’re often involved in graduate student unionization and strikes. Thus, there are real opportunities within the U.S. to build solidarity with Chinese students, both in common struggles in the U.S. and with those in China. This means we must oppose any kind of U.S. nationalism and anti-Chinese racism, as such bigotry would divide graduate students and undermine union solidarity. The objective basis for international solidarity from below is greater than ever before, and the necessity of it is obvious for anyone seriously thinking about these issues. The problem is subjective and political. We need to build a Left that is militantly committed to internationalism from below—not just as a principle, but as an organizing strategy. How we do this is complex, and every part of the international Left needs to think through how to do it. But either we find a way to build such solidarity, or we will suffer our ruler’s barbarism–their domestic class wars at home and their imperialist wars abroad. So, the Left must organize a new generation of socialist militants who understand the centrality of the old socialist slogan, “Workers of the world unite; we have nothing to lose but our chains.” That is not some quaint historical mantra, but our epoch’s central political project. Either we succeed in this or we face the barbarism in Gaza and the ever-growing list of climate catastrophes.

Title: What will 2025 bring for Linux PCs?

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The year ahead has a lot in store for Linux users. Many of the trends, hardware products, and software developments below comprise a colorful mix that focuses on the use of Linux in particular. We also include other current and future events in hardware and software that will influence or characterize everyday IT life — Linux or otherwise. The upshot is that Linux users will see a lot of change on the horizon. Raspberry Pi Foundation Since the Raspberry Pi Foundation went public in mid-2024, the future of the successful board computer has been quite uncertain. The share price has been volatile since then, but has held up reasonably well overall. The fresh millions on the stock market open up opportunities for technical innovations for the mini-computer, but on the other hand the project is moving away from its non-profit origins. Nothing concrete is currently known about future models, but prices will be higher than before. The continued production and stocking of older models, as was previously the case, could also fall victim to profit maximization. See also: 10 surprisingly practical Raspberry Pi projects anybody can do The Gnome 47 and KDE Plasma 6 desktops are forcing the switch to the Wayland display protocol by setting Wayland as the standard despite some remaining detail problems. Most Linux distributions with these desktops (Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, KDE Neon, Endeavour, et cetera) will follow this specification in 2025. The fact remains, however, that apart from Gnome and KDE, only the niche desktop Enlightenment (current version E20) is aggressively pushing for Wayland. The Gnome-like Budgie desktop, as well as Cinnamon (Linux Mint) and Mate, still offer Wayland as an “experimental” option. XFCE (announced for the upcoming version 4.20) and LXQT are just starting their Wayland conversion. Cinnamon running in Wayland. Linux Mint The replacement of the old X11 window system will obviously continue well beyond 2025. This is a stumbling block, not least because every Wayland operation currently still has to drag along the Xwayland mediation layer in order to be able to display older X11 windows. The current Gnome 47 is the first Linux desktop that is at least technically prepared to completely dispense with Xwayland in the future. Debian A new Debian version is released approximately every two years. After version 12 “Bookworm,” which was released in 2023, Debian 13 (“Trixie”) is due in 2025. With Debian “Forky,” the name for version 14 has already been decided. Debian 13 will continue to offer a variant for 32-bit processors, but no longer for very old i386 CPUs, but at least from i686 onwards. i686 CPUs are also ancient processors such as Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and some early Pentium 4 models. The oldest of these CPUs are over 25 years old and date back to the 20th century. Regardless of Debian’s 32-bit continuity, the recycling of such oldies is usually unsatisfactory. New Debian is always immensely important because many derivatives are based on Debian and must also be updated as a result — such as Antix, Bunsenlabs, Kanotix, MX Linux, Linux Mint Debian, Ope Media Vault, Pi-OS, Rescuezilla, Sparky, Q4-OS, Tails, and many more (Ubuntus!). Ubuntu After April 2025, there will be no more update support for Ubuntu 20.04, unless you have taken out the 10-year ESM (Expanded Security Maintenance) support with Ubuntu Pro. On devices with version 20.04, you will then either have to reinstall or make up for several upgrade stages. A new installation with the current LTS version Ubuntu 24.04 is particularly recommended for systems that work as servers. After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer offer free updates for Windows 10 and technical support will be discontinued (EOL, End of Life). As a simple upgrade to Windows 11 will fail for many laptops and PCs due to the high hardware requirements, a significant wave of users switching to Linux desktops can be expected over the course of the next year. Last year’s Linux growth to a market share of around 4.5 percent is probably already linked to this Windows date. Unicon is launching the eLux operating system for companies. The system is designed to combine security, hardware flexibility, and performance. The download requires registration with an email address. Windows 10 will be discontinued on 1 October 2025. If Windows 11 does not run on the hardware, any (even more demanding) Linux will run. Anton Watman/Shutterstock.com Experience has shown that Linux distributions are generally too fragmented to make concerted and aggressive use of the opportunities offered by the Windows runtime. Only some of the typical Windows detractors such as Linux Mint or Zorin-OS will refer to their Windows-like concepts and optimize them. In addition, most tried-and-tested Linux desktops (mostly Debian/Ubuntu-based, in some cases also Arch-based) are also suitable as Windows 10 alternatives. See also: 3 free Linux distros that look and feel like Windows Open Suse Leap 16.0, the successor to Leap 15.6, is not expected until mid-2025 at the earliest. Version 16 aims to end the technical continuity with the previous Leap, but at least promises the possibility of a direct upgrade to Leap 16. If necessary, an interim version 15.7 will be added. openSUSE Open Suse Leap 16 will be an “immutable” Linux. Suse is developing its own Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP) architecture with a write-protected base system that increases security and stability. The required software is to be provided by isolated containers — presumably flatpaks. With its focus on cloud systems and automated system management, Open Suse Leap 16 is likely to follow the trend of recent years. The Suse system is becoming increasingly uninteresting for the needs of a flexible end-user desktop. The same applies to Fedora Workstation, which in the Silverblue “Immutable” version is signalling the path that Fedora generally wants to take. The security and maintenance advantages of the immutable concept are aimed at cloud and server instances and mainly have disadvantages on the desktop. Nix It is perhaps not necessarily the Linux distribution Nix-OS itself, but its concept of “declarative configuration,” which probably has a great future ahead of it. Nix-OS uses a central configuration file as a meta-level. This allows the entire system to be reproduced identically (e.g. for cloud and server instances), but can also be reset to previous system states (relevant for servers and desktops). Package dependencies are avoided because — similar to container formats — software is always stored separately with all dependencies. The concept requires a lot of storage space and the adoption of completely customized methods for package installations and updates. Cloud providers are already in the thick of it, but Nix-OS should still provide some additional convenience features for desktop users. While Microsoft has included the sudo tool as an option for developers in Windows 10/11 in 2024, leading Linux developers want to abolish sudo or offer a better alternative. The new run0 tool is already available in the latest versions of the Systemd init system. IDG In future Linux distributions, run0 will certainly not immediately replace the familiar sudo, but will at best run as an alternative for the time being. The run0 tool has several advantages over sudo: In principle, it requires no configuration, whereas sudo requires the not entirely uncomplicated “/etc/ sudoer.” run0 is based on Polkit, whose individual configuration is not simpler, but is usually unnecessary. As run0 loads an isolated systemd target, it is more secure than sudo, which relies on rights masks in the file system (SUID bit). In addition, run0 gives visual signals in the terminal and window title to indicate the current elevated permissions. We have barely gotten used to the new term IoT (Internet of Things) when the next “internet” is added. IoB — Internet of Behavior — is more or less a consequence of IoT: the Internet of Things with smartwatches, webcams, health trackers, sensors, measuring stations, and smart home devices expands the data material that websites and apps collect through direct communication. IoT provides masses of additional data that can be analyzed statistically (trends, anomalies, causalities). These IoB statistics and behavioral analysis are not only driven by the retail and advertising industries: IoB can provide insurance companies, health insurance companies, traffic planners, the police, and entrepreneurs with interesting information and correlations that do not necessarily have to be personalized. It is not yet clear which IoB analysis will become part of everyday life in the future. Data protectionists are already warning that there is a lack of transparent user consent for data collection. In the context of the growing customs dispute between the USA, EU, and China, Huawei is preparing to say goodbye to Windows operating systems on its laptops. In the future, the Chinese manufacturer intends to offer its self-developed Harmony OS operating system. Harmony OS is based on its own Linux-independent (Hongmeng) kernel. The operating system was previously only planned for Huawei smartphones, but will also be available for laptops in the future. Huawei laptops will run Harmony OS from mid-2025. Microsoft is thus losing a major Windows customer. Huawei Harmony OS is said to perform better than Linux desktops. It is entirely plausible that the Chinese IT giant can achieve this for the hardware it produces itself. However, compatibility with software is problematic. It is not yet clear to what extent Harmony OS will also offer customized standard software or integrate it via a translation layer. Potential buyers of the attractively priced Huawei laptops should consider this question carefully. TP-Link Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is five years old, many older routers and devices still work with 802.11ac or even older 802.11n. From 2024, there will be more and more devices with radio chips of the new Wi-Fi generation 7 (802.11be). The Linux kernel is prepared for this — from version 6.5 to be precise. Wi-Fi 7 will not only significantly increase data throughput, but will also use MLO (Multi-Link Operation) to communicate across multiple radio bands between the transmitter and receiver devices. This improves both throughput and stability. New DDR5 RAM modules with higher speeds and lower latency will come onto the market in 2025. However, DDR6 is already on the runway: The next generation of DDR RAM is not due to be released until the end of 2025 at the earliest. DDR6 will again be significantly faster than current DDR5 RAM. The specification speaks of at least 8800 MT/s (megatransfers per second) for the first DDR6 generation, which is roughly double that of DDR5. Later DDR6 components should then achieve up to 21,000 MT/s. G.Skill Innovative graphics formats have been flourishing in photography and imaging for years, but they have been very slow to catch on. While all browsers and many image editing applications now support the Google Webp format, the Apple HEIF/HEIC format and the JPEG successor JPEG XL still need help from add-ons for software or additional packages for the system on many systems and image viewers. REDPIXEL.PL The High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) is favored by iPhones for photos. HEIC is the associated container format that also stores image sequences, comments, and audio in addition to (HEIF) images. JPEG XL (jxl) is the designated successor to the long-standing JPG standard. In 2025, it is expected that all Linux distributions will increasingly prepare their viewers and file managers for these formats. Experience has shown that the question of which image format will prevail is obsolete: There will simply be a few more in the future, while JPG, PNG, and others will continue to exist. There is no question that there will be no standstill in CPU development in 2025. AMD will introduce new Ryzen CPUs such as “Kraken” and Intel is planning Panther Lake processors based on its latest production technology (18A). The goals are the same — more performance, more efficiency. Alexander56891 / Shutterstock.com Regardless of new CPU records, the new (marketing) term “AI PC” or Copilot PC (Microsoft) will come into focus. In this product class, which performs AI functions on the local device, a fast CPU is not enough — at least a dedicated GPU graphics chip (preferably Nvidia), plenty of DDR5 RAM, and a fast SSD are also required. The more obvious feature that distinguishes an AI PC from a gaming PC or a powerful workstation is the additional NPU chip (Neural Processing Unit). NPUs cannot process AI models any better or faster than the GPU, but they are much more energy-efficient. In other words: computer bolides are AI-capable, but only energy-efficient with an additional NPU. Processors with an NPU extension already exist — from Intel (Lunar Lake), AMD (Ryzen AI), and Qualcomm (Snapdragon). However, it is not yet clear how future-proof these first NPUs are. See also: The AI PC revolution: 18 essential terms you need to know Mass storage devices are experiencing continuous capacity growth every year. New records are on the horizon for 2025: SSD: The maximum capacity of SSDs is expected to increase from the current maximum of around 60TB to 128TB by mid-2025, more than doubling. This has been announced by several manufacturers such as Western Digital, Huawei, and Samsung. Mechanical drives: The classic hard drive is reaching its technical limits and has already seen its greatest leaps in capacity. However, the current maximum of 24- to 32TB should be able to be increased again in future thanks to new HAMR technology (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is announcing drives with 40TB for 2025, and up to 60- or 80TB by the end of the decade. Jon L. Jacobi NVMe SSD: Capacities of up to 16TB are expected for M.2 NVMe storage on the PCI Express bus by 2025. This means a doubling of the currently largest NVMe SSDs. For end users, the record capacities are hardly relevant and generally hardly affordable. More important is the market law that with new, faster, and larger media, the prices for smaller and medium capacities will fall. USB 4 is the joint successor to USB 3.2 and Thunderbolt 3 with a theoretical maximum throughput of 40Gbps (approx. 5GB/s). USB 4v2 (also “USB 4.0 Gen 4” and more recently “USB4 2.0”) theoretically achieves 80- or 120Gbps. The first controllers and drives of this generation are already on the market. Drivers for USB 4v2 are included in the current Linux kernel. This article originally appeared on our sister publication PC-WELT and was translated and localized from German.

Title: The Rise and Future Fall of MicroStrategy

Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Emil Sandstedt Follow -- 1 Listen Share TLDR: My interest in the story of MicroStrategy started out tangential at first — it was just one of many unconventional outcomes born out of the rising Bitcoin phenomenon. The publicly traded company, although first in the world to pursue a Bitcoin accumulation strategy, flew under the radar of most conventional investors, and it was only after the long Bitcoin winter of 2022 and early 2023 that both old and new narratives from the company and its de facto leader, Michael Saylor, broke through the thawing ice and began to spread among a bewildered audience. 2024 catapulted MicroStrategy to new sensational heights, and I soon realized I was witnessing financial history in the making. The general enthusiasm was unparalleled; sons went “all in” with the savings of their parents while old investors bought new houses from quick gains on leveraged positions. Any public display of hesitation to the many optimistic narratives energizing investment circles was met with scorn or silence. When logical arguments against the company’s ever higher valuation to net assets were put forward, they were answered by vague appeals to unofficial thought leaders or to a vision of a utopian future. On the verge of letting this one be altogether and mentally filing it as just another financial bubble soon to pop, I finally made the decision to work on this report as a veiled but growing Ponzi-scheme element of MicroStrategy’s business became ever clearer. So, having delved deep into the facts and fiction underlying common investor assumptions, it is now my firm belief that what is going on with MicroStrategy will end in disaster for most investors, should affairs not radically alter. It is a play of five parts, presented chronologically to the reader. Emil Sandstedt, 2024–12–06 MicroStrategy’s early history is laid to rest behind a thin curtain, mostly undisturbed by the hands of modern investors. It is known by a few that the company reached big and fell even bigger in the Dotcom Crash of the year 2000, but which growing Internet-focused company wasn’t experiencing great hardships at that time? Yet, could there be clues from those years which could be relevant today, to where the fate of MicroStrategy is heading? Let’s blow away the dust, break the crypt open and see what the passing of decades has caused to be all but forgotten. Starting out as a software company helping other companies make strategic decisions based on large amounts of accumulated data, MicroStrategy had enjoyed considerable interest and growth since it went public in 1998. CEO Michael Saylor had aimed at going public at $6 per share, had filed for $8–10 per share, sold the stock at $12 per share, only to see it rapidly continue all the way up to $46 per share. The appetite for intelligently utilizing digital data was, at this time, enormous. As an example, fast food restaurant clients could, by using MicroStrategy’s software analytics services, understand customer preferences within a geographical context; a customer in Florida was less likely to purchase a certain product than a customer in Chicago, given local circumstances. In a world where the customer is king, predicting what they actually wanted, when, and how, was profits in the making. So with Internet usage growing exponentially in 1999, Saylor thought it was time to ramp up his vison of the digital disruption of the economy. By analyzing and processing data in real-time, MicroStrategy now wanted to deliver a service which could feed useful information, not just to large companies, but to the public. The product, an anywhere personal information network called Strategy.com, was to be offered for a small monthly fee — today a very common model for software companies — and was therefore arguably ahead of its time. Starting modestly, the service was initially to focus on sending out useful information on fickle changes in financial markets to phones, pagers and other outlets. But the goal was more far-reaching than that — when the Washington Post asked Michael Saylor for more details on his vision, he simply noted that “I believe in fate, but all things being equal, I’d rather not be standing in front of a truck when it comes down the street.” With the sprawling information network and with the help of ear-pieces, civilians would be able to receive warnings of an ongoing robbery in the street ahead of them, drivers would receive proactive, intelligent heads-ups about traffic jams before finding themselves in one, and athletes would receive real-time data on weather approaching the game field. Michael Saylor, characteristically, painted a dramatic picture: “Take the police database in D.C. loaded into a network and then call me on the phone when there’s a robbery in my neighborhood going on right now. Don’t walk the dog, right now. There are police with sirens and shotguns running around in your neighborhood looking for three guys with knives. Right now.” The service, in other words, would help make life both easier and safer, with the help of a never-ending tsunami of intelligently processed data. Saylor, having observed the success Amazon had built by utilizing the personalized data of customers, noted casually in an interview, “So we started to ask the question ‘How do we get embedded into everyone’s life?’”. As the theory of the new business was reaching completion, Saylor now sought a $100 million investment, about the size of the company’s annual revenues, to bring it to market. Though a somewhat vague term, the company in other words wanted to bet on “proactive intelligence”. Adding to the examples above, Michael Saylor in another interview brought up the subject of fraud, and how an intelligent software could help mitigate it. In his example, a client is notified about the strange movement of funds from one account to another, followed by an automated text whether or not the client wants to cancel the transaction. It is not hard to see the advantages of such proactive warnings, and they are in fact implemented in multiple forms in today’s digitized economy. But in a way which would later become distinctive of Michael Saylor, he couldn’t help adding that his company was “to take everything from being unintelligent to intelligence…”, and that MicroStrategy was not an ”Internet company”, but an “intelligence company”. That also included disrupting the massive medical insurance industry with the anonymous processing of customer data. The idea that almost all data could be gathered and properly processed for all sorts of clients was a driving force in the appreciation of the value of MicroStrategy shares. Strategy.com was such a bold attempt in these early times of the internet, so all-encompassing, that it was hard to comprehend the potential ramifications stemming from a success of it. If the company could enhance data from hospitals, police stations, stock markets etc. in real-time, there seemed to be no limit to how valuable the output of the algorithms could be. Michael Saylor himself confidently stated that his system ultimately was going to “purge ignorance from the planet”. On a question whether or not going public with his company had changed him, Michael Saylor answered: “I think it’s made me better. It’s forced me to deal with more constituencies. It teaches you some things. Like integrity, for instance. In a public-company world, your word really means something. When you’re private you say, I’m going to do this, and if it doesn’t happen it doesn’t matter. In the public world, you say you’re going to do it, you have to do it. In the public world there’s a difference between 11:59 and 12:01, the last day of March. There’s a tangible difference. One of them is you go to jail if the thing gets signed at 12:01. One of them is the stock is up $500 million and the other one is you’ve just torched the life and livelihood of a thousand families. One minute.” Finishing up the Washington Post interview, he predicted his company would eventually reach $10–20 billion in annual revenue. And at the time, perhaps the prediction did not sound altogether unreasonable. Saylor had after all confidently stated that “I think my software is going to become so ubiquitous, so essential, that if it stops working, there will be riots. […]. I mean that literally. I mean that people will die this year because they didn’t buy my software.” Shares continued to climb in 1999, and in the beginning of the ominous year 2000 the company had become one of the most admired in the Washington region. Shares rose ever higher, and Michael Saylor threw grand parties at his Florida mansion. A plan to build a massive 50-acre Versailles was drafted. But the celebrations and toasts to new times were not to last long. In March, MicroStrategy felt compelled to adapt to new accounting standards put in place a few years earlier to better reflect the reality of the operations of a growing number of software companies in the nation. In practice, this meant that MicroStrategy had overstated its revenues two years in a row, and what was priorly booked as profitable years now turned deeply red. The original 1999 annual profit of $12.6 million was now restated as a loss of as much as $40 million. In a market sensitive to even small misses on investor expectations, the company shares crashed about 62% in a day, reducing Michael Saylor’s net worth by multiple billions of dollars — one of the largest daily personal losses in the world to that date. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company’s auditors, had put a stamp of approval on past reporting, so the change did not exactly stem from a complete failure in that regard. What had happened with the revenue discrepancy was extremely ironic; a late-night business deal had been struck with the large technology company NCR Corp on September 30th, 1999, but as no flow of goods or money occurred that day, NCR booked it in the fourth quarter of the year, while MicroStrategy booked it in the third quarter. In other words, Michael Saylor had found himself in exactly the situation he so much dreaded during the interviews with the Washington Post earlier in the summer. Had he not booked the revenues stemming from the business deal in the third quarter, the company shares would likely have crashed and severely complicated the funding of the company’s ongoing Strategy.com transformation. Instead, Saylor and the other higher-ups in the company saw shares increase 72% in value since that fateful meeting, paving the way for large sales of their personal holdings for a total of $82 million during the period. That was more than four times the value of previous insider sales since going public. Not only was the revenue booked wrongly, but the deal also included the promise by MicroStrategy to purchase a business unit and some software from NCR, thus netting the total effect of the deal on revenues. “Revenue washing” is a well-established way to artificially inflate booked revenues while not being properly reflected in actual business activity. So, three problems were now glaringly obvious to investors who had just lost a lot of money: revenues had likely been booked in the wrong quarter, the $27.5 million NCR deal involved a tit-for-tat purchase of about $25 million, and the MicroStrategy executives and board members had sold shares that they likely knew were severely overvalued, to the open market. While the details of the NCR deal came to light, a later deal with Primark Corp. to distribute financial information to investors, also attracted the eyes of market analysts. Quite incredibly, Michael Saylor seems to have found himself in the situation yet again, where a business deal was signed and booked in the fourth quarter of 1999, while it was actually carried out and paid for in the first quarter the year after. Investors, oblivious at the time to any wrongdoings in the two separate business deals, had bid up shares above $300 before all the accounting issues came to light. All this seems to have become too much for the SEC, which promptly launched an investigation into the company. It eventually compelled MicroStrategy to admit to booking revenues wrong over the last three years rather than the last two. At this time, shares were down more than 80% since their all-time high. Michael Saylor’s company stake had dropped in value, from $13.6 billion to $1.7 billion. The Strategy.com investment never materialized as the company failed to get approval for new share issuance and sales before the value of the shares cratered in March 2000. A plan to raise up to $2 billion, then the largest stock offering in software industry history, came to nothing. Michael Saylor’s vision of a large proactive intelligence network was put on ice, and the company returned to its tried ways of conventional data mining. The abrupt fall was distinct enough to prompt James Cramer, columnist for TheStreet.com, to state that “This one popped the bubble. MicroStrategy forever changed the Internet mania.” The rise and fall of MicroStrategy would, except for the whispers in obscure investor circles, eventually be followed by a long silence. But the years passed, and Bitcoin finally entered the world and caused an ever-larger stir around the globe. Saylor initially discarded the phenomenon, writing that “#Bitcoin days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.” But as the network grew, and after various decadent money printing schemes had been put in motion by governments in 2020, something seems to have changed within Michael Saylor. A growing opportunity now lay before him and his company, perhaps larger than all his prior visions put together, as a new untrodden path opened under the gaze of an orange sun. MicroStrategy entered its Bitcoin Exploration phase simply as an enterprise analytics software and services company with a checkered past and with fading growth. There is nothing wrong with that — the company made small profits on the capital it applied to the purpose. Few assumed much future growth in revenues, and valued the company shares accordingly. Total revenues for the second quarter of 2020 were reported as $110.6 million, a 6.1% decrease from the year before. In that same report (10-Q, 2020–06–30), however, the word “Bitcoin” appeared for the first time. What followed was the company with its investors, under the surprised gaze of its peers, boldly moving away from competing with IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and Salesforce, to standing alone at the door to the growing Bitcoin sector. The report, after announcing the buyback of $250M worth of shares through a modified Dutch Auction, added that: MicroStrategy will seek to invest up to another $250 million over the next 12 months in one or more alternative investments or assets, which may include stocks, bonds, commodities such as gold, digital assets such as bitcoin, or other asset types. (10-Q, 2020–06–30, Exhibit 99.1.) In August 2020, an 8-K document (8-K, 2020–08–11) was filed at the SEC, announcing the purchase of 21,454 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $250.0 million. The risk factors section of the previously published quarterly report was amended, and Saylor noted in the document that: “Bitcoin is digital gold — harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it. We expect its value to accrete with advances in technology, expanding adoption, and the network effect that has fueled the rise of so many category killers in the modern era.” (8-K, 2020–08–11, Exhibit 99.1.) The conventional Treasury Reserve Policy of the company was updated with a Bitcoin-focus in September the same year, with a new 8-K filing. And after the Q2 report had mentioned the word “Bitcoin” once, the Q3 report mentioned it 154 times. The air in the company was now thick with change. During the third quarter of 2020, MicroStrategy ended up owning about 38,250 Bitcoin, purchased for $425 million ($11,111 per Bitcoin). This from a considerable portion of the company cash position. By September 30, 2020, MicroStrategy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $52.7 million, compared to $565.6 million by the end of 2019. On the 4th of December 2020, MicroStrategy bought 2,574 more Bitcoin (8-K, 2020–12–04). For the annual report of that year, the shift in strategy is again palpable, and the mention of raising capital for the purpose of buying Bitcoin through debt or share issuance could be spotted for the first time: MicroStrategy® pursues two corporate strategies in the operation of its business. One strategy is to grow our enterprise analytics software business and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin. […]. [A]nd we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin. (10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, p.5.) Approximately 70,469 Bitcoin were purchased in total in the year 2020, indicating many were purchased at the very end of the year. All Bitcoin now had an average purchase price of approximately $15,964 per coin. The later batches of purchases were made with an issuance of $650 million principal amount of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2025. The issuance was announced in December 2020, and had a conversion price of about $397.99 ($39.799 for the post-split shares of August 2024) and thus MicroStrategy went from purchasing the new volatile asset with surplus cash, to purchasing it with convertible debt. One of the first things incredulous onlookers reacted to was the low interest rate for the bonds — something which we will return to later. In early 2021, MicroStrategy, already operating under its amended Treasury Reserve Policy, officially adopted a Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy, further strengthening that focus. Within weeks, a new convertible bond issue was announced (8-K, 2021–02–16), this time of up to $1,050 million of 0% convertible senior notes due 2027. Though larger than the first issue, its zero coupon meant the lender’s full focus was on the equity component of the convertible bond. The focus of the borrower was, as we know, to purchase more Bitcoin with the proceeds. Conversion price of the bonds was priced at about $1,432, meaning about $143 in 2024 post-split shares. After the purchase of more Bitcoin, the number of Bitcoin per share climbed above 0.001. For the first time, investors in the company had to contemplate the nuances of MicroStrategy having issued multiple types of convertible bonds, as the conversion into shares of one issue could affect the parameters allowing conversion for other issues. Some confusion arose out of this, which we will speak more of later. In June 2021, a third bond issue was announced, this time of $500 million worth of 6.125% senior secured notes due 2028. This being a conventional straight bond, it can be observed how the market viewed the risk of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy, through the coupon payments. Herein lies the first clue in how to view the low coupon payments of the first two issues. Were the earlier bonds really as cheap as they seemed at a first glance? It was a relevant question that investors could now ponder. At the time of this third bond issue MicroStrategy owned 92,079 Bitcoin, and now more could be acquired. As of January 31, 2022, MicroStrategy held approximately 125,051 Bitcoin (8-K, 2022–02–01) which were acquired at an average purchase price of about $30,200 per coin. On the 29th of March 2022, a fourth debt issue was announced, this time with Silvergate Bank, of $205 million secured by Bitcoin held in MicroStrategy’s collateral account. The loan had a floating rate equal to the SOFR 30 Day Average plus 3.70%, with a floor of 3.75%. The collateral was set at double the loaned amount, $410 million. Saylor concluded that “the SEN Leverage loan gives us an opportunity to further our position as the leading public company investor in bitcoin.” The Silvergate loan was paid back in March 2023 at a discount (8-K, 2023–03–24), due to the interest rate climbing up towards 8%. The payment could be made by the company issuing new MicroStrategy shares, though not yet at a premium to net assets. This meant that three bond issues, of which two were convertible, were still outstanding. In the 2022 annual report the company’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy had clearly overtaken any focus on the software business, as seen in the number of mentions of “Bitcoin”, and in the stated order of company objectives. As of February 15, 2023, MicroStrategy held approximately 132,500 Bitcoin with an average purchase price of approximately $30,137 per Bitcoin. Further purchases that year were funded mainly by the issuance and sale of new shares (8-K, 2023–06–28). As MicroStrategy at the time traded near its net asset valuation, meaning its cash and Bitcoin holdings, the share issuance and purchases were not much affecting the company capital structure. Not until the end of 2023 did the Bitcoin price recover enough to surpass MicroStrategy‘s cost basis. At that time, the company held 189,150 Bitcoin, with an average purchase price of $31,168 per coin. Starting in 2024, the market valuation of MicroStrategy in proportion to its Bitcoin holdings quickly increased to about two. This meant that the implied valuation of a Bitcoin held by the company was double that of a Bitcoin trading at exchanges. The software business, now a very small part of the company’s dealings, had become more or less irrelevant and could share no consideration in the total valuation. Investors were bidding on shares because of the Bitcoin exposure, and nothing else. Before the approval of the Bitcoin ETF in January 2024, a popular narrative circulated around the assumption that the premium earlier had manifested itself due to MicroStrategy offering the only possible exposure to Bitcoin for various institutional investors. MicroStrategy mentioned this dynamic in its annual report for 2023: On January 10, 2024, the SEC approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin ETPs, the shares of which can be sold in public offerings and are traded on U.S. national securities exchanges. The approved ETPs commenced trading directly to the public on January 11, 2024, with a trading volume of $4.6 billion on the first trading day. On January 11, 2024, and in the subsequent days following the SEC’s approval of the listing and trading of spot bitcoin ETPs, the trading price of our shares of class A common stock declined significantly relative to the value of our bitcoin. To the extent investors view our class A common stock as providing exposure to bitcoin, it is possible that the value of our class A common stock may also have included a premium over the value of our bitcoin due to the prior scarcity of traditional investment vehicles providing investment exposure to bitcoin, and that the value declined due to investors now having a greater range of options to gain exposure to bitcoin and investors choosing to gain such exposure through ETPs rather than our class A common stock. (10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, pp. 24–25.) As the premium to the company’s net asset value quickly recovered and continued to increase in the following months, despite the approval, some went in search of other explanations or narratives. The quickly increasing share price mostly dissuaded such considerations, however, and optimism reigned supreme. While some mulled over the rising premium to net asset value, the company issued more convertible debt for the first time in almost three years (8-K, 2024–03–11). $800 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2030 with a 0.625% interest rate meant more Bitcoin could be accumulated with the proceeds. Here, for the first time in a long time, could MicroStrategy make use of the premium to its net asset value. A few days later, another issue was made of $600 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2031 with a 0.875% interest rate (8-K, 2024–03–19). As of February 14, 2024, the company held about 190,000 Bitcoin, with a purchase price of $31,224 per coin. MicroStrategy had now officially morphed into the “world’s first Bitcoin development company”, according to its annual report for 2023 (10-K, 2023, p.7). What, exactly, this entailed is hard to determine, but a qualified guess is an internal focus was shifting towards building blockchain analytics tools, first layer Bitcoin clients, Lightning Network clients, and so on. Any Bitcoin software useful to the entity running it, could fetch a continuous yield as real as the yield from Microsoft software. As of April 26, MicroStrategy had accumulated 214,400 Bitcoin, meaning the milestone of owning more than 1% of all supply had finally been achieved. The coins were acquired for approximately $35,180 per coin. Total revenues, per the Q1 report (8-K, 2024–04–29), was $115.2 million, down 5% year-over-year, further emphasizing the fading relevance of the non-Bitcoin parts of the company. In June, a fifth convertible bond issue was conducted (8-K, 2024–06–17). The bonds were $800 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2032 with a 2.25% interest rate. Almost simultaneously, the company’s first convertible bond issue with a principal of $650M and a conversion price below the current share price, was prematurely redeemed by converting it all into equity (8-K, 2024–06–13). Capital structure decisions taken three and a half years ago now made themselves known. Though more Bitcoin were purchased with the proceeds from the fifth convertible bond issue, the Bitcoin per share ratio seems to have increased only marginally at this time. In July, MicroStrategy announced a 10-for-1 split (8-K, 2024–07–11). All debt contracts automatically changed in proportion, and the report has previously dealt with post-split conversion prices for the convenience of the reader. In September, the company announced Bitcoin purchases for over $1 billion, conducted with proceeds from share issuance (8-K, 2024–09–13). This meant it continued to take advantage of the premium to net asset value, and its accelerating accumulation now reached 244,800 Bitcoin. Also in September, a sixth convertible bond issue was planned, to raise enough funds to redeem the 6.125% 2028 Senior Secured Notes issued in June 2021 (8-K, 2024–09–16). The move is in line with a capital structure optimization strategy, as the new convertible bond issue would be done with shares at a premium. The issue was $1.01 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.625% convertible senior notes due 2028 with a $183.19 conversion price, and all the secured bonds of 6.125% were consequently redeemed — a good move by the MicroStrategy team. The company’s bond schedule now looked something like the following: The exploration phase was concluded; the company had now found its orange path to success, and it lay not in Bitcoin- or non-Bitcoin software development, but in pursuing accretive treasury operations. In a historical announcement in connection with the 2024 Q3 earnings report (10-K, 2024–10–31), the company, in a hat-tip to Satoshi, announced the goal of a $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity offering — meaning share issuance — as well as a target of raising $21 billion using fixed-income securities. The plan was to conclude over the course of the next three years. At the time of the launch of the plan the debt approximately amounted to a $4.26 billion principal. The rapid shift from being a Bitcoin Development Company to a Bitcoin Treasury Company is clearly seen in the change of the Business Overview section of the Q2 report and the Q3 report. The latter, having pushed all software development, on Bitcoin or otherwise, to the background, now stated: MicroStrategy® is the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company. We are a publicly traded company that has adopted Bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset. By using proceeds from equity and debt financings, as well as cash flows from our operations, we strategically accumulate Bitcoin and advocate for its role as digital capital. Our treasury strategy is designed to provide investors varying degrees of economic exposure to Bitcoin by offering a range of securities, including equity and fixed income instruments. In addition, we provide industry-leading AI-powered enterprise analytics software, advancing our vision of Intelligence Everywhere. We leverage our development capabilities to explore innovation in Bitcoin applications, integrating analytics expertise with our commitment to digital asset growth. We believe our combination of operational excellence, strategic Bitcoin reserve, and focus on technological innovation positions us as a leader in both the digital asset and enterprise analytics sectors, offering a unique opportunity for long-term value creation. (10-K, 2024–10–31, p.26.) What a Bitcoin Treasury Company meant in practice was simultaneously explained by the new MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le, in an 8K-filing: “As a Bitcoin Treasury Company, we plan to use the additional capital to buy more bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset in a manner that will allow us to achieve higher BTC Yield.” (8-K, 2024–10–30, Exhibit 99.1.) So with yet another rebranding of the business to a Bitcoin Treasury company, with a stated goal to create Bitcoin yield — a metric first spotted in September (8-K, 2024–09–16) — MicroStrategy entered The Golden Age in its pursuit of a place in the history books. Now fully focused on extracting Bitcoin yield to the fullest extent, the company defined the yield as, BTC Yield is a key performance indicator (“KPI”) that represents the % change period-to-period of the ratio between the Company’s bitcoin holdings and its Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding. Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding refers to the aggregate of the Company’s actual shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of each period plus all additional shares that would result from the assumed conversion of all outstanding convertible notes, exercise of all outstanding stock option awards, and settlement of all outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units. (8-K, 2024–10–30, Exhibit 99.1.) The Bitcoin yield could come from multiple sources, and MicroStrategy has to this date utilized some of them more than others. By selling shares through ATM offerings at a premium to net asset value, the Bitcoin yield could come out of the proceeds from buyers of the newly issued shares. The total Bitcoin yield is in that situation precisely equal to the total premium paid by these marginal buyers. In other words, it is not inherent to the ATM offering itself, but is provided from outside the corporate structure. By raising funds through convertible bond issues, a positive Bitcoin yield could similarly come from Bitcoin purchases made with the proceeds from buyers of the bonds, while a negative yield could later materialize should the convertible bonds not convert in the future. By issuing straight bonds, a positive Bitcoin yield could also come from the immediate proceeds, but would very likely turn negative in the future when the debt had to be repaid. This last method has been employed only once by the company (twice if counting the short-lived Silvergate Bank issue). The first two methods are much more lucrative with shares trading at a premium to company net assets. If shares are at a premium, this constitutes an arbitrage opportunity for MicroStrategy when utilizing the ATM offerings. Though not strictly an arbitrage, convertible bonds issued while the company trades at a premium create opportunities as well. If the bond holders in the future convert the bonds at inflated conversion prices, they receive newly issued shares at a price often above the company’s net asset value, and the generated Bitcoin yield would then stand in proportion to this premium. All this considered, the company’s 21/21 Plan logically focused on the first two types of treasury operations; more shares and more convertible bonds were to be issued. Within two weeks of the bold 21/21 Plan MicroStrategy had bought approximately 27,200 Bitcoin for $2.03 billion, at an average price of approximately $74,463 per coin (8-K, 2024–11–12, Item 8.01). The purchase seems however to have been made by depleting the previously undertaken ATM offerings, and any new purchase was now to be made through the new plan. On the 18th of November, we could first see such a filing (8-K, 2024–11–18). The company had bought 51,780 new Bitcoin for $4.6 billion in cash, at an average price of about $88,627 per coin. This catapulted the company’s Bitcoin holdings to over 300,000 for the first time, marking yet another milestone. Over 13 million new shares were issued to fund this. Two days later, on the 20th of November, the company’s largest convertible bond issue to date was announced (8-K, 2024–11–20). $3 billion was raised at 0%, with a conversion price of $672.40 at 55% premium, and with maturity in 2029. This meant that both the ATM offering arm and the convertible debt arm of the 21/21 Plan were being utilized. Issuance now occurred at a pace hard to keep up with, as the MicroStrategy team wanted to take advantage of the company’s shares trading at a premium to net assets. On the 2nd of December the company’s Bitcoin holdings reached above 400,000 for the first time as more shares had been issued and sold (8-K, 2024–12–02). Bitcoin yield for 2024 was now enormous, and about half of the ATM offering arm of the 21/21 Plan had been exhausted. With Bitcoin yield surpassing even the highest company estimates of the Q3-report, everything was going better than planned. The new shares hitting the bid on enthusiastic buyers in record numbers did nothing to dent the premium to net assets — in fact, November saw net asset multiples at the highest levels in years. With shares trading at 200% above net asset value, this meant the MicroStrategy treasury team could issue and sell shares representing ownership of 1 Bitcoin, to fund the purchase of 3 new Bitcoin. Net proceeds, 2 Bitcoin, would then be the Bitcoin yield, divided and given to all shareholders in proportion to ownership of the company. The 2 Bitcoin would be the Bitcoin per share increase in aggregate. There are a number of reasons the company could extract Bitcoin yield at the pace it now was doing. Investors argued that MicroStrategy’s debt was cheap. And indeed, it borrowed billions of dollars and paid often less than 1% in annual coupons — far below official inflation numbers. In a world swimming in surplus cash, it seemed lenders were willing to part with capital at record low interest rates. While this debt mostly came in the form of convertible bonds, it was argued that the company would not suffer dilution, because the debt was accretive with shares trading at a premium to net asset value. In fact, investors clamored for this type of dilution, seeing as the Bitcoin per share metric could continuously increase. The premium to net assets, it was also argued, came from the fact that MicroStrategy was a “levered play” on Bitcoin. With ETFs, investors either had to suffer the dull movements of an asset without leverage, or face the large risks and volatility decay of levered ETFs. With MicroStrategy, you could get a levered upside, but withstand being wiped out in prolonged downturns, as proven in 2022 and 2023. Because of the company’s flexibility to use “intelligent leverage”, the premium seemed reasonable to any thrill-seeking bitcoiner. It was argued that the premium also originated from “regulatory arbitrage”. With this, investors pointed to the fact that the company helped facilitate exposure to Bitcoin for institutional portfolios not allowed to own Bitcoin, or even an ETF, outright. The bond market, very large but also very restricted, had with MicroStrategy’s innovative convertible bonds finally a way to get exposure to Bitcoin on the upside, while being protected to the downside through the bond “floor” — the principal amount. It did not seem unreasonable to assume that if MicroStrategy now was the main actor providing such financial products, it of course should reap profits from the operations, manifesting itself in the share premium. At this time, the popular narrative of an “infinite money glitch” was used to rationalize a premium as well. And on the face of it, it seemed reasonable. MicroStrategy could issue convertible bonds with conversion price at a premium and buy Bitcoin with the proceeds. As the price of Bitcoin increased, the company’s fundamental value increased, meaning shares increased in value as well. With the higher valued shares, the company could now issue even more bonds, in a seemingly circular flywheel dynamic. Another version of this narrative is the notion that MicroStrategy conducts a “speculative attack” on the fiat currencies. So when the 21/21 Plan was initiated, and with the above considerations in mind, investors could foresee large Bitcoin yield payments to the shareholder owned company coffers. The shares increased in price accordingly. Within less than a month, Saylor could announce that the company had achieved a Bitcoin yield surpassing 40% year-to-date — an enormous number compared to the yield of traditional finance. Within five weeks since launch, the year-to-date Bitcoin yield had surpassed 60%. Everything crushed expectations, and it appeared to many as if the Bitcoin yield could soon be extracted in a near unlimited supply as a stagnant fiat economy realigned its rusting axis with a new, pristine Bitcoin foundation. While the ATM offering activities were absorbed by the market happily enough, the demand for the company’s convertible bond issues seemed near bottomless as well as they grew ever larger in size. Michael Saylor had become the uncontested hero of many bitcoiners. Having accumulated the single largest Bitcoin hoard the world had ever seen, nothing could stop the company’s ascendancy. Or could it? While foreshadowing clearly can be read between the lines of the earlier rationalizations of MicroStrategy’s valuation, it should be remembered that all this mainly took place in a market where equities reached all time highs, gold reached all time highs, and finally, Bitcoin and MicroStrategy reached all time highs. Whatever unstructured thoughts investors had in their heads all seemed vindicated by the reality of riches quickly made. No one had much appetite to consider what was happening through a lens of first principles, where complex financial dynamics are broken down in smaller and smaller parts that you know to be true. As the premium on MicroStrategy shares to net assets increased and not decreased with the accelerating ATM offerings, it was simply accepted by some as a truth within the asset, rather than as a contradiction in need of logical inquiry through laws of finance. Let us now go through many of the popular narratives and see what substance they all really hold. “Don’t forget the dirt cheap loan (.063%) he secured for 6 or 700M.” — Reddit user #1. “Imagine loaning someone 700M and 0% interest instead of buying btc.” — Reddit user #2. It is an easy mistake to make, in assuming that a low interest rate on a debt instrument means it is cheap. But because MicroStrategy’s many bond issues for the purpose of buying Bitcoin are convertible to equity at a predefined conversion price, a low interest rate on the bonds can’t be compared with interest rates on normal loans. It should go without saying that if lenders demand more than 4% from the US Government, they will not simultaneously demand less than 1% from MicroStrategy — a company with decreasing revenues and where the main business now consists of buying and holding Bitcoin. Convertible bonds are hybrid securities with debt-like and equity-like features. They are in practice regular bonds with free embedded call options, meaning the price (also known as the premium) of the call options makes up for the lender’s loss of a high yield, or coupons. Here is a simplified illustration of a convertible bond’s value at maturity: In other words, with the convertible bond issues, MicroStrategy had not found a philosopher’s stone, but could bypass a high interest rate on its debt only by giving away upside as the bonds convert into equity at conversion price. Just because investors wish the company could borrow cheaply, does not make it so. The company’s straight bond issue in June 2021 was priced at 6.125% coupon payments, giving a truer indication of the company’s cost of capital. To further emphasize the point, consider for a second what could happen if MicroStrategy were to move the maturity date further away, or lower the conversion price of the convertible bond issue, meaning the strike price of the embedded call option. A situation could then arise where a lender pays MicroStrategy for the privilege of lending to the risky company! The yield on the bonds turns negative. While seemingly unreasonable at first glance, it is simply a result of a large prepayment by MicroStrategy in the form of the free call options, for the privilege of “borrowing cheaply”. We can conclude that the narrative breaks down, yet it is repeated regularly by many MicroStrategy investors every time another convertible bond issue is undertaken. Some investors seem to have misunderstood another aspect of the company’s convertible bonds. It concerns the notion that the company is protected from dilution due to how the convertible bond issues are structured. And it is not a surprise that many are confused. Consider for example the wording from the very first company announcement of a new issue: “Subject to certain conditions, on or after December 20, 2023, MicroStrategy may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any […].” This sounds like a great deal to MicroStrategy — not so much for the lender. But this is common wording for convertible bonds. It does not mean that if the share price surpasses the higher conversion price stipulated for the convertible bond, MicroStrategy can somehow redeem the bonds just before they were to convert into equity (and as a consequence stop the dilution of existing shareholders). The wording is to force the bond holder to convert to equity, should that not happen for some reason. Certain bond investors may for example be market neutral hedge funds that short sell the shares while buying the convertible bonds. Many of them would rather the bonds not quickly convert — they seek volatility to profit from gamma trading. In practice, non-conversion is a situation which should never occur if conversion conditions have been fulfilled. Given a choice, bond holders of course want the higher valued shares at conversion price, rather than the initial principal amount plus a bit of interest. Looking at an SEC filing from MicroStrategy three and a half years after the first convertible bonds were issued, when early conversion of these notes to new shares actually took place, further strengthens this understanding: On June 13, 2024, the Company announced that it delivered a notice of full redemption (the “Notice”) to the trustee of the Company’s outstanding 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). The aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes being redeemed is $650.0 million, which is equal to the current aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes outstanding and held by investors. The Notice calls for the redemption of all of the outstanding 2025 Notes (the “Redemption”) on July 15, 2024 (the “Redemption Date”), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the Redemption Date, unless earlier converted. As a result of the delivery of the Notice, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 11, 2024, the 2025 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holders of the 2025 Notes, at the applicable conversion rate of 2.5126 shares of the Company’s class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount (reflecting a conversion price of $397.99 per share). (8-K, 2024–06–13) In summary, if the share price increases, there will be conversion of these debt instruments into equity, meaning new shares. BitMEX research understood this to be the case as well while recently investigating the company’s capital structure. MicroStrategy is not protected from dilution — if it were, the lenders in the first convertible bond issue would not agree to a 0.75% coupon, but would likely demand something closer to a 6–10% coupon. As MicroStrategy issued more convertible debt, a question arose as to whether the potential dilution of equity by some convertible bonds affects the other convertible bonds or not. The answer lies in anti-dilutionary clauses. Consider that for convertible bonds the conversion ratio = principal amount/conversion price. Anti-dilutionary clauses means that the conversion ratio increases in proportion to dilution, meaning the conversion price decreases in proportion (as principal amount stays the same). A 5% dilution from one bond converting into equity, in other words, lowers the conversion price of the other bonds accordingly. Another way to view it is that the “strike prices” of all other issued call options, as baked into the convertible bonds, decrease in proportion to dilution. If there were no anti-dilutionary clauses, the company could simply issue shares and sell them to keep the share price from ever reaching the conversion price stipulated for the various issues. Lenders would for obvious reasons not accept such a convertible bond at low yield, because the free call option would be engineered to expire worthless. Again, they would demand perhaps a 6–10% coupon, not less than 1%, which has been the case for MicroStrategy. “Buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin goes up, Stock is tied to Bitcoin, Stock goes up, Sell stock, use cash to buy more Bitcoin, repeat. Infinite money glitch.” — Reddit user Somewhat related to the narrative of “cheap debt”, is the popular claim that MicroStrategy has found an “infinite money glitch”. An investor may for example argue that MicroStrategy can issue shares or convertible debt, sell it, purchase Bitcoin with the proceeds, the price of Bitcoin increases, the MicroStrategy share price increases as a function of the underlying Bitcoin holdings, and the company issues and sells even more convertible debt. And round it goes. But MicroStrategy does not have control over the Bitcoin price; the size of the issues is dwarfed by Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Whatever buy pressure the company can apply on the Bitcoin price through these treasury operations, is multiple times offset by the sell pressure applied by the new issuance on the MicroStrategy share price. Note that the sell pressure is immediate if from share issuance or from convertible bond issues bought by market neutral hedge funds. The sell pressure is latent and may occur in the future if from convertible bond issues bought by regulatory restricted investors seeking Bitcoin exposure in roundabout ways. But there is ultimately no way around it all, unless the company were to pursue regular bond issuance, meaning the total risk undertaken by the company increases in proportion to the leverage. So any “infinite money glitch”, could just as well transform into permanent monetary losses should the company have to liquidate parts of its Bitcoin holdings or raise funds in a depressed market environment as the convertible bonds finally mature below conversion price. In other words, there is no glitch, but mainly debt-fueled risk taking which may give a certain boost to the upside, or a fatal blow to the downside. It remains to be seen how current treasury operations will affect the company when times are bad. The potential for creating shareholder value through capital structure shenanigans must obviously be discounted by the very real risk of future fire sales. “It is going up forever Laura”, though a catchy meme, is not economic reality. With the continued issuance of shares through ATM offerings to purchase more Bitcoin, onlookers thought that Saylor conducted some sort of magic trick, where he with no additional risk could increase the company’s Bitcoin per share ratio. It needs to be stressed that the issuance in 2023 and early 2024 was conducted with little to no premium to net asset value. In practice, this meant that any Bitcoin purchase through such a measure is fully offset by the dilution of the shares. The company may own 10% more Bitcoin after everything has been concluded, but any old shareholder has been diluted by about 10% as well. The Bitcoin per share ratio can’t increase this way — it is only possible with instruments such as regular bonds (meaning higher risk), convertible bonds (meaning higher risk), or with the issuance of new shares if the premium to net asset value is above one. Being generous to the prominent bitcoiners discussing the dynamics in the referenced video, they do in fact mention issuance during high price to earnings (P/E) ratios. The P/E ratio for MicroStrategy is currently irrelevant, however, and what they need to look at is, as has been pointed out, the premium to net asset value. MicroStrategy has no earnings to speak of, in relation to its high market valuation. Its P/E can in the future increase or decrease while booking unrealized gains or losses on the Bitcoin it owns, but that does not mean it is time to issue shares and buy more Bitcoin (or sell Bitcoin to buy back shares). The company should only consider such issuance if the premium has climbed some way above one. And such a scenario, in fact, happened a few months after the above discussion. It can be added here that the same dynamic holds true for convertible bond issuance. MicroStrategy can, if shares trade at a premium to net asset value, issue and sell the convertible bonds with a high conversion price, to the detriment of potential buyers of the bonds. As the shares trade at a premium, it is evident that the bond conversion price must be at an even higher premium, causing conversion conditions to be unusually hard to meet. As with the ATM offerings, MicroStrategy is better off issuing convertible debt when shares are at a premium. This share premium should not be assumed, however, but that will be discussed later in the report. More P/E-related confusion came years later, as MicroStrategy’s treasury operations brought heaps of Bitcoin yield to excited investors. In a clever twist of definitions, Saylor took this yield to be equivalent to earnings, and from there implied an extremely high fundamental value of the company based on a “P/E ratio” as well as “earnings growth” snapshot. There were multiple things wrong with this narrative. For P/E to be relevant in company valuation, the denominator must be somewhat consistent over time. A high one-off earnings number can make any company look undervalued versus peers, but it is all an illusion should that high earning not be followed by similar numbers. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin yield is provided mostly by retail investors buying company shares at a premium, and there is a finite supply of those. It is not honest to extrapolate temporarily high Bitcoin yield and imply the company should be valued much higher — that’s not how it works. Capturing the premium in ATM offerings is an activity with a finite lifespan, given the nature of the operation. Furthermore, part of the Bitcoin yield also stems from the convertible bond issues, and they come with a risk; the bonds may not always convert, meaning the principal amount would need to be paid back. Having then already categorized the Bitcoin yield stemming from such proceeds as earnings, is an Enron-like categorization error. The outstanding bonds in question must mature or redeem before booking the Bitcoin yield as earnings. Mark Meldrum pointed out exactly this. “#Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy.” — Michael Saylor While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy kicked into high gear in 2024, it was argued that Bitcoin was the best reserve asset to hold there is for a company, because it has no drag, or no decay. The asset’s low maintenance costs were compared to those of the heavy machinery of Bristol-Myers Squibb, technical monstrosities that for obvious reasons are in need of constant service and care. The comparison fails because the machinery has an inherent yield — it produces more than what it consumes, or it would not have been painstakingly constructed — whereas the Bitcoin of MicroStrategy so far is a “dead asset”, sound asleep at the custodians without any conventional yield. While the comparison to physical capital is halting, it should be realized that even if one were to view them that way, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings still impose costs. Someone, somewhere, is paying the Bitcoin miners, or the network has no hashrate and subsequently is susceptible to DoS attacks. Assuming that it is others, and not MicroStrategy, that will bear the brunt of this cost is probably a mistake. It should also be added that MicroStrategy makes use of US custodians — the decay being the annual costs and risk of theft and confiscation there. Bitcoin is not a completely cost-less asset to own, and should not be characterized that way. A master wordsmith of analogies, Michael Saylor has provided his share of comparisons as well. One of the more famous ones is that Bitcoin is a “Cyber Manhattan”, digital real estate which people should want to buy and own for a hundred years. Having accumulated a considerable portion of this digital real estate within a company framework, investors were soon to realize the true value of MicroStrategy. This comparison halts on many accounts. While painting real estate in Cyber Manhattan as immortal, as not subject to a fickle or corrupt mayor, to physical decay, to taxes, to regulations, to break-ins etc., this is first of all forgetting that all such factors can change. Many nations are already considering taxes on unrealized gains, and to prop up their own failing currencies and bonds, such assets may obviously be excluded from the tax schemes. But the most obvious difference between Bitcoin and real estate is the yield received from rental properties. This is a sector which will never go away, because investors always seek yield. Even in a hypothetical hyperbitcoinized world, investors can invest in the real estate market and earn Bitcoin yield forever. Again, Bitcoin is mostly a dead asset, as is a gold coin, or a seashell. It does not yield in itself (and shouldn’t). For yield it must first be traded for a capital good, such as ownership in factories, skyscrapers, service firms etc. Another popular but vague Saylor analogy is that the company’s Bitcoin are digital capital, and that this is something novel and exclusive in the economy. Capital are production goods — goods of higher order. They are goods that are aquired for the purpose of producing consumption goods. Any software used by companies around the globe is digital capital. Any currencies used by banks to create financial products or services are digital capital. The term is not at all exclusive to Bitcoin, and ironically, most of the time when Bitcoin owners think they hold “digital capital”, they hold the coins in cold storage, just as a gold owner may keep gold coins in a vault. If the good is not used for producing another good, then it is simply not capital. There is nothing wrong with that — not everything you own must be geared towards production. “Don’t try to put some premium trading bullshit. Don’t try to make something up from thin air. Because all your models are fucking broken.” — MicroStrategy thought leader. Notwithstanding the fact that the belief in a persisting premium to net asset value, or NAV, is itself a model, we are now approaching the most critical takeaways of the report. As 2024 proceeded with MicroStrategy shares exploding upward, and as the premium to the company’s net assets persisted in spite of the go-ahead of new Bitcoin instruments, some onlookers voiced their confusion about all this. Simultaneously, the popular Quant Bros duo released their first video on pre-split MicroStrategy, titled “Can MicroStrategy (MSTR) hit $10,000?”, outlining something which “the Ben Graham philosophy would just never understand”. The high valuation forecasting was based on the assumption that shares could uphold the premium. Together with the Bitcoin yield narrative explored later on, it is the most important narrative within MicroStrategy investment circles today. They form the basis from which an immense wealth transfer from new buyers to old ones is occurring. Let us start by investigating this premium to net asset value narrative, and the many shapes and forms it currently comes in. With the growing amount of issued convertible debt for the purpose of accumulating more Bitcoin, investors found themselves warming to the notion that owning MicroStrategy shares instead of owning actual Bitcoin, was a “leveraged play” on the latter. Intuitively, it felt like the leverage was in strict proportion to the debt ratio. But Mark Meldrum rightly pointed out that this is misleading. If shareholders are levering by senior convertible debt, the leverage is rather to the downside than to the upside. If the share price increases, the debt is all converted into equity at conversion prices, diluting shareholders. If the share price decreases, the debt is not converted, but the shareholders must eventually pay the principal amount as well as coupons, if any. Meldrum is slightly too harsh in his conclusion that there is no leverage to the upside. It should be remembered that the conversion prices of the various bond issues in general are about 35–50% above the price of MicroStrategy shares at the time of bond issuance. Because of this, there is leverage to the upside in proportion to the debt ratio of the company, but only up to the conversion price, at which the debt of the bond issue is eventually converted, and old shareholders must share in further price appreciation with the new ones. The upside from conversion price and onward has been given to the bond holders in the form of the free call options mentioned earlier, to make up for the low yield on the convertible bond issues. There was of course a valid reason MicroStrategy paid nothing in interest rate for some of its convertible bonds. The loans were not free. So with a conservative debt ratio of about 25%, the leverage quickly loses much power should the share price surpass conversion prices in a parallel move with Bitcoin. A large premium to net asset value can therefore not be explained by the company’s convertible bond issuance. For investors seeking leverage on Bitcoin price movements, there is also an ever-increasing arsenal of instruments catering to that demand, such as levered Bitcoin ETFs as well as options with a Bitcoin ETF as underlying asset. None of these “levered bets” on Bitcoin carry the premium that MicroStrategy does. So paying more for a Bitcoin held by MicroStrategy, than for one you could hold yourself, must therefore not be excessively rationalized by pointing at “the leveraged play”. If anything, indirectly purchasing Bitcoin for a premium through MicroStrategy shares trading at high multiples to net asset value, means the investor is overpaying in proportion to the premium, for the doubtful privilege of getting leverage with equity features. And finally, it is important to realize that past performance of the shares is not evidence of a “leveraged play” — it is only evidence of buyers bidding up the price. If the shares indeed have increased in price much more than Bitcoin — the company’s main underlying asset — it is simply because many investors believe that is how the stock “ought to behave”. If shares were to decline for a period of time while the price of Bitcoin goes up, that does not mean the company is some type of short play on Bitcoin. It would simply mean investors are selling shares for some reason, and others are buying Bitcoin for another reason. Causality hides in the fundamentals of company operations, not in the price discovery of jittery speculators. Looking at the slope of a Bitcoin per (diluted) share metric could give an investor a better picture of how large any “leveraged play” in practice really is, but the surest path is to dive into how the company capital structure actually functions. Quant Bros, and others, also argued that the premium must persist due to the nature of the future awaiting a Bitcoin-laden MicroStrategy. Holding close to 2% of all existing Bitcoin by beginning of December 2024, it was now argued that the Bitcoin were to form the basis of the vague banking system of tomorrow, meaning any premium to net asset value must be due to various future banking activities with the Bitcoin as digital capital. There are multiple things wrong with this assumption. First, MicroStrategy is a software company which has issued debt and equity to purchase Bitcoin. It is extremely generous to simply assume that they have an edge in banking, of all things. What is to say that other custodians such as Coinbase, Kraken, Binance or the likes, can’t offer better financial Bitcoin banking products and services? Or that more conventional banks such as Blackrock or JP Morgan ultimately won’t start accepting Bitcoin deposits? Banking is a sector which has painstakingly developed over many centuries, and to think that outsized profits related to it can be made by simply having accumulated a Bitcoin hoard is very naïve. Who will borrow the Bitcoin? For what purpose? What if there are large credit losses, private key incidents, or wrong choices in future chain splits? No such considerations are given when the Quant Bros are discussing, not a 2X premium, not a 3X premium, but a 60X premium to net asset value. Looking at Nvidia, not in the business of lending Bitcoin, but of producing extremely competitive microchips and related software, the comparison was still thought a valid one by the enthusiastic duo. Curiously, Saylor also has a habit of comparing MicroStrategy to totally different companies: “For people that haven’t been paying attention or don’t really do any research, if you actually logged into our earnings call or if anybody studied the company, that’s like saying there’s a perception that Microsoft trades are a premium to its underlying assets. Oh yeah, it does trades 50 times greater than its net tangible assets. So does Apple, so does Standard Oil, so does every operating company, so that the myth, the misunderstanding here is people don’t understand what our operating business is.” (x.com spaces, “Bitcoin as a National and Corporate Asset w/ Senator Lummis & Saylor”, 2024–11–19.) What does it mean to MicroStrategy’s valuation, were it to actually become a proper Bitcoin bank? The average price-to-book ratio in the banking industry is slightly above one, as banks periodically mark-to-market assets and liabilities. Any multiple above one represents a premium stemming from expectations of future growth and excess earnings. Why a MicroStrategy morphing into an adventurous Bitcoin bank should fetch a high premium remained unexplained by the Quant Bros duo, which instead speculated that it didn’t “[…] think [MicroStrategy] being the most valuable company on the planet is widely unreasonable.” We have to remember that a premium for the company can’t be rationalized by pointing at general increases in the price of Bitcoin or in the past price action of the shares themselves — that is all irrelevant. A fund or an ETF trades at net asset value, regardless of whether the underlying asset goes up 100% or down 50%. So, a premium on MicroStrategy shares must come from investors expecting future growth, not in the price of Bitcoin, but rather in the Bitcoin per share metric. This expectation must also take into account the additional risk the company accepts in order to achieve this growth. Any conservative investor should not accept a valuation much higher than net assets, especially considering how the Bitcoin per share metric is engineered to increase, but more on that later. Many banks, while borrowing more cheaply than they lend out, trade at deep discounts to net assets due to the uncertainty of how solid the asset side of the balance sheet really is. As MicroStrategy ramps up convertible bond offerings, an outsized increase in a Bitcoin per share metric can very well be met with cracks spreading within its capital structure, should things take a turn for the worse in Bitcoin markets. Saylor’s comparisons to Apple, Microsoft, Standard Oil and other companies trading at a premium to book value, are misleading mainly for the reason that those companies are not banks. Their assets are not liquid financial assets like MicroStrategy’s, and they may also have depreciated book values over decades to lower taxable profits, or simply booked assets a long time ago so that they no longer happen to reflect profits actually generated. Current cash flows from Windows software products likely far exceed whatever once was booked on the asset side of Microsoft’s balance sheet. It should also be mentioned that most companies can’t very well issue shares and conduct arbitrage trades by simultaneously buying factories, office space, software or oil fields. MicroStrategy, however, can conduct arbitrage trades by issuing shares in order to buy Bitcoin, a liquid, fungible asset traded on hundreds of regulated exchanges, at all times of the day. The comparisons to fantastic price-to-book ratios in totally different industries are made to dazzle potential buyers of shares with back-of-the-napkin calculations on ridiculous net asset multiples. But none of it is real. Michael Saylor may speak of Bitcoin as digital energy, or of MicroStrategy as the crude oil refiner of futuristic finance — it is still wrong to assume that net asset valuations from that industry are at all relevant. There is no doubt that a lot of confident talk can be heard everywhere in MicroStrategy investor circles, with regards to the company’s premium to net assets. But talk is cheap as they say. Turning instead to the actions of the company and its leadership, greatly supported by investors, we will note that these actions fly in the face of the arguments the investors themselves simultaneously are making for any premium. MicroStrategy issues shares (equity), and convertible debt (equity if the share price goes up). This is, again, not a bad strategy while the shares trade at a premium to net assets. But it should be remembered that the company in this way slowly helps close the valuation gap that is the premium, by using the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin or pay off old debt. With a premium to net asset value close to three, at time of the commencement of the 21/21 Plan, the company could sell one Bitcoin worth of shares, and purchase about three Bitcoin on the open market, or redeem three Bitcoin worth of debt. This is an arbitrage by definition — Saylor labeled the 200% risk-free return as exactly that while on CNBC in December. The glaringly obvious arbitrage explains why Saylor himself, as well as other company executives, have continuously sold shares throughout the year. It should be noted that Saylor’s selling plan was set in motion before Spring of 2024, when a considerable premium to net asset value had not yet materialized. Some investors argued that Saylor had to sell the shares, as previously received call options neared maturity date. But exercising the call options does not mean selling the shares is mandatory, unless there is some special clause we don’t know about. It just means the call options convert into shares at strike price. And even if it were the case that Saylor for one reason or another had to sell his newly received shares, the massive issuance and sale of company treasury shares would still have to be explained. Some optimistic MicroStrategy investors were then quick to note that though Saylor’s selling was not mandatory, it was done to buy more Bitcoin personally. But if they believed it was in his interest to do so — in fact that it was “a genius financial move” — why did they fail to consider why it is not in their own interest to do the same? If Saylor considers the shares overvalued in terms of Bitcoin, perhaps due to the arbitrage he himself has mentioned on national television, why do investors who idolize his every financial move argue the exact opposite? On the whole it may be concluded that the company and its executives do exactly what some defenders of the premium deem “NAV multiple trading bullshit”, and there is a logical reason for that. The constantly reoccurring SEC filings of executives selling company shares while never buying, do in fact hint of this truth which so few MicroStrategy investors dare think about. One wonders how many of these filings we must see before investors take note. Just after the announcement of the largest ATM offering in history, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang sold 5,700 shares (Form 144, 2024–11–06). One day after, board member Leslie Rechan sold 20,000 shares (Form 144, 2024–11–07). The same day Senior Executive Vice President & General Counsel Wei-Ming Shao sold 20,000 shares as well (Form 144, 2024–11–07). Not a week later, Leslie Rechan cashed out on 20,000 shares yet again, netting about $5.5 million (Form 144, 2024–11–12). On the 13th of November, board member Stephen Graham sold 30,000 shares, netting over $11 million (Form 144, 2024–11–13). That very same day, Wei-Ming Shao sold another 18,000 shares, and the day after he sold more. CEO Phong Le sold shares on the 14th as well (Form 4, 2024–11–15). A week later, Stephen Graham sold a massive 20,000 shares further, netting $9 million (Form 144, 2024–11–21). In the face of all this selling, investors still remained oblivious to the valuation conundrum the many narratives had obfuscated in their minds: Saylor, the other company executives, as well as the company treasury all appear to be massively selling the very shares that are supposed to be severely undervalued. Seeing as company executives and the company treasury keep selling shares in ever larger numbers, consider for a second a situation where the premium is slowly captured in this manner, so that shares end up with a valuation closing in on that of actual Bitcoin holdings. In other words, where the net asset value multiple is nearing one. Is it suddenly impossible for Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy to pursue the banking adventure, which supposedly is a foundation to the premium in the first place? Of course not. The company can just as easily pursue its wild career starting with 500,000, 600,000 or 700,000 Bitcoin. There are no incentives whatsoever for the company to leave arbitrage on the table for others to try to capture, since Bitcoin banking does not depend on any premium persisting. It is rather amazing to watch MicroStrategy thought leaders viciously defend the premium while the company and its higher-ups are franticly devouring it. There is another popular idea floating around in the MicroStrategy investing space, supporting the claim that the company should trade at a premium to net assets. It is the notion that “no one can catch MicroStrategy” in terms of the number of accumulated Bitcoin. The obvious question must then be, what this claim actually means, and why it should justify shares at a premium. If we are to assume that no other company will ever be able to own 2% of the total supply of all Bitcoin, that is all well and good, but what does that have to do with the premium? If owning such a large share of the supply somehow implies great profits in a future economy, it means the premium arises from being able to deploy the large Bitcoin stash for specific purposes. Why would not large Bitcoin custodians such as Coinbase, Kraken or Binance, perhaps sitting on even larger portions of Bitcoin, be able to apply their hoards in a similar fashion while sharing the profits with willing depositors? Would it be logical to say MicroStrategy “could never catch up”, because the company only sits on a few hundred thousand Bitcoin whereas some of these exchanges may have up to a million coins in custody? The notion is nonsense and has almost nothing to do with the fundamental value of MicroStrategy. Blinded by vast returns, many investors have stopped thinking when they assign a monopoly premium to the notion of simply owning more Bitcoin than others. Additionally, it should be noted that smaller Bitcoin banks (or “treasury companies”) can compete with larger ones. Though consolidation occurs naturally in a free market, there have been many thousands of banks competing for customers over the centuries, some specializing in order to survive. The same would occur within a growing Bitcoin bank sector. There are no natural monopolies. One prevalent argument in support of a sustained company premium to net assets concerns the so-called “regulatory arbitrage”. It is claimed that through innovative treasury operations, MicroStrategy can offer financial products to a regulated market which otherwise would have no opportunity to get exposure to Bitcoin. It should be remembered that MicroStrategy previously has discussed the premium in relation to the go-ahead of a Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. That day, shares fell sharply, only to quickly recover. Could it be that the premium to net asset value can be sustained due to the fact that, while many equity investors now have proper vehicles to get Bitcoin exposure, bond investors do not? The company’s convertible bonds have multiple times achieved large successes, so it has been logical to assume the regulatory arbitrage is real, and that MicroStrategy as sole issuer now could profit from it. But there are many things wrong with this assumption. First, we must ask ourselves why there are all these huge funds that are allowed to own only bonds. The prevention does not stem from nowhere, but from self-regulation in the case of family offices, and from laws in the case of pension funds etc. These rules were put in place by someone for the specific purpose of minimizing risk, while still generating returns to clients. As bond owners, these funds stand first in line to company assets should bankruptcy threaten. Now, Bitcoin is a very volatile asset, and while it may seem obvious to some why potential returns from it can look tempting to bond portfolio managers, it is likely not obvious to those enforcing the risk management rules. Any loophole suddenly allowing for large exposure to a non-yielding digital asset which very few have expertise on, can be closed just as quickly as it was innovatively created. For this reason alone should it not be assumed that a “regulatory arbitrage” premium is large and long-lived. How about other daredevils wanting Bitcoin exposure but can’t seem to find it due to regulations? Certain pension equity accounts may buy MicroStrategy shares, but not Bitcoin outright. Can a regulatory arbitrage premium persist through this type of investors? There is a case to be made here, but any premium would likely be very small, as agile investors could simply increase exposure to Bitcoin with their conventional savings, instead of paying a fee in proportion to the premium to net asset value when adding MicroStrategy to their pension accounts. It should not be assumed that people are not creative in finding the amount of Bitcoin exposure they are comfortable with, while minimizing more expensive, roundabout Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy. So, we are mainly left with a, perhaps temporary, demand for bonds with Bitcoin exposure, before regulators swing their hammers. And while observing MicroStrategy history up to the 21/21 Plan but also after, we indeed see such actors willingly buying the bonds, even when conversion price is reflecting a huge premium to net assets. Has MicroStrategy actually found an alchemic formula here so strong, to start attracting trillions of dollars from the untapped bond market? The answer is likely no. The buyers of the bonds are likely not the type of family offices where an ”orange-pilled” heir has convinced the managers that “Bitcoin bonds” is the exposure needed to increase pitiful past performance. No, what is likely happening with all the convertible bond issues is that MicroStrategy prices the bonds in a manner to attract market neutral hedge fonds, meaning arbitrageurs. Saylor has briefly mentioned these firms, as opposed to firms seeking actual Bitcoin exposure. For issue after issue, they can be spotted as the largest bond holders by anyone with a Bloomberg terminal. By buying the bonds, even when conversion price is at a large premium, and by simultaneously shorting the shares, these arbitrage funds can lock in close to risk-free profits. Due to the convex nature of the value of the convertible bonds, the hedge funds attempt to profit no matter whether MicroStrategy shares rise or decline: When shares go up in value, the (green) straight bond and embedded call option increase more in value than the (red) short position decreases in value. When shares go down in value, the short position increases more in value than the straight bond and embedded call option decrease in value. This is the lucrative gamma trading offered by MicroStrategy to the hedge funds to have the bond issues appear highly successful. Note that the “danger” of gamma trading — shrinking volatility — can be offset by pricing the bond issues at lower implied volatility than the market assigns the underlying asset, meaning shrinking the grey area of the graphs as they move away from each other. To conclude, whatever profits are made by these hedge funds are taken mainly from MicroStrategy shareholders; the profits do not materialize from thin air. The narrative of regulatory arbitrage continues to spread among retail investors, while little such demand is spotted in actual market activity. By talking about all these regulations, and by perhaps mispricing a bond issue or two to appease the hedge funds even more, Michael Saylor can regularly breathe life into the narrative that his company ought to trade at a premium to net assets because it alone can offer the financial products the regulated market demands. Mark Meldrum is even so cynical that he speculates that the hedge funds can attempt to engineer volatility outright, because it is the soil in which their gamma trades can grow and thrive. In other words, it may be in both the company’s and the hedge funds’ interest to see shares violently crash and recover, perhaps related to a leak to journalists, or to short report analysts. But all that is pure speculation. What we do know for sure is that though the narrative fails under scrutiny, it is still alive and well out there and helps absorb massive insider and company selling, resulting in enormous wealth transfers from new investors to old ones. The narratives surrounding the fact that MicroStrategy trades at a large premium to net assets are strong and in many cases convincing at a first glance. But here, they have all been investigated in detail and consequently dispelled. For large investors in MicroStrategy, it is of highest importance that the premium persists, because it is only from the golden goose that is the premium, that the egg, the “Bitcoin yield”, materialises. This metric, the increase in Bitcoin per share, is what continuously increases the fundamental value of the company, given any specific Bitcoin price. So let us now turn to the narratives surrounding the Bitcoin yield, and what they produce when working in tandem with those of the premium to net assets. “A Ponzi scheme is a type of financial fraud in which the ‘success’ of the entity is propped up by paying returns to initial investors from the money invested by subsequent investors.” (Investopedia.com) “Bitcoin yield” is the growth in Bitcoin per share — a metric mentioned many times in the report, and which has been excessively used to argue in support of shares trading at a premium to net assets. The logic provided is something to the tune of, while a Bitcoin is worth itself, a Bitcoin with a steady Bitcoin yield must be worth more. It is an honest metric for MicroStrategy in the sense that it takes into account conversion of convertible bond issues into equity. But it is dishonest in the sense that the yield is not stemming from conventional business operations such as lending out Bitcoin or developing Bitcoin related software applications. The company, likely for legal reasons, recognizes this to a degree in its SEC filings but still proceeds heavily with the metric. All that the “Bitcoin yield” ultimately is, is a transfer of wealth from new shareholders to old ones. Overvalued shares are sold, and understandably so, to fund new purchases of Bitcoin. These new Bitcoin increase the floor to where the share price must eventually go by the mechanic of arbitrage trades. The fundamental value of MicroStrategy, meaning the total valuation of the company’s Bitcoin holdings, increases in proportion to the proceeds from buyers of newly issued shares, because the shares trade at a premium. In other words, the new buyers are the Bitcoin yield. They are the arbitrage. There is no way of really knowing whether or not Saylor understands this himself — he might be lost in his own analogies. After the valuation of his company imploded in the year 2000, one of his friends noted that, “Mike let himself become this image that kept feeding on itself. After a while it’s drinking your own bathwater. After a while it became hubris.” Be that as it may, it is not with a little amount of irony that one of the company’s official principles today is to “treat all investors with respect, consistency and transparency.” The issuing of new overvalued shares to increase the Bitcoin per share metric helps securing a profit for old shareholders (as the fundamental value rises above what they paid for their shares). It also helps securing a loss for the new buyers (as the market value falls towards the rising fundamental value). It is a mechanical operation which at this very moment runs its course with $42B worth of muscle behind it, until there are no new buyers of shares at a premium. The circular reasoning binding the two most important narratives together, and which is feeding trusting souls to Saylor’s massive yield extractor, can be visualized like this: This has formed the core of the sentiment given rise to the extreme run-up to $500 per share while share issuance has been running hot. The higher the shares run, the higher Bitcoin yield can be demonstrated to new investors. As the new investors are buying with previous Bitcoin yield numbers in mind, the base from which the yield is extracted must by definition be ever larger for everything to work. Mark Meldrum came to the same conclusion and visualized it wittily in a YouTube video which may one day become a financial market classic. By rotating the company’s own 21/21 Plan slides, he built a pyramid from which MicroStrategy’s highly sought after Bitcoin yield were to be extracted in the years to come. As there is a limit of the number of new MicroStrategy investors, the ever-lower foundations of this pyramid must start crumbling soon. It is now evident that uninformed retail investors are providing the Ponzi yield through the company’s ATM offerings, but what about the convertible bond issues? Who are the victims in that case? If the buyers of the bonds were investors hindered by regulation to own Bitcoin outright, a yield could indeed stem from these investors as they acquired shares at conversion prices far above the net asset value of the company. But as we have seen, almost all bond holders are hedge funds that sell short the stock at the time they take a bond position. By borrowing the shares to sell them, we are sadly back at the incredulous retail buyer once more, acquiring shares at a large premium. The sobering conclusion is the following: the Ponzi yield is extracted from retail investors both through the ATM offerings and through the convertible bond issuance, by the fact that the latter so far is a façade, a Potemkin Village. All narratives have fallen. MicroStrategy’s new KPI is extracted within the framework of a corporation, and is, if not the exact definition of a Ponzi scheme, something very close to it. In other words, a greater fool’s dance seems to be playing out to the tune of a multitude of confused narratives. And as with all Ponzi-like financial structures, this one will eventually face reality as well. Having shown mainly with first principles thinking how the many MicroStrategy narratives are false or flawed, it is time to explore the result of a dawning realization in these matters. As company management continuously captures the premium to net asset value through more ATM offerings and convertible bond issuance, there is an incrementally growing portion of investors whose future Bitcoin yield will not cover the cost of entering the Ponzi scheme. Finding themselves in one of the bottom layers, they observe how new Bitcoin yield is shared among an ever-growing mass of investors, and while the metric declines, the hesitation of potential new investors increases. It is likely that investors then will attempt to front run the increasingly obvious conclusion of the Ponzi mechanics and sell their shares to recoup some of what they paid to enter. With a drastically declining Bitcoin yield, it could otherwise take many decades for a latecomer to recoup what he or she paid with a high multiple to net asset value. It is both quicker and much less risky to simply sell immediately into the bid, while a premium still exists. The declining premium and share price will have further consequences, as we soon shall see. Before thinking about what a premium collapse means to the company’s ability to handle its debt, let us consider whether or not a declining Bitcoin yield actually is the only factor which will send shares crashing towards net asset value. It has already been concluded that the convertible bond issues are vital to nurture a company premium to net assets through the regulatory arbitrage narrative. The company feeds retail investors the narrative so that they can be used for exit liquidity as well as for yield. But the problem is that the bond buyers are gamma traders — they need volatility to continuously profit, and they don’t care much whether or not the shares decline, go sideways, or rise in value, as long as they do it in a volatile manner. Mark Meldrum was to my knowledge the first to point this out; if MicroStrategy fails to provide this volatility — the convexity of the long position in the arbitrage trade — then the bond buyers quickly abandon ship. Taking their place are cross-asset arbitrage hedge funds shorting the shares while entering long positions in the underlying Bitcoin on a volatility neutral basis. Such operations could collapse the premium to net asset value even quicker than retail investors slowly coming to the realization that when Saylor says he loves Bitcoin, he really does mean it and has no plans to abandon the capture of the premium. What further makes the whole convertible bond capital structure strategy precarious is that the larger the debt issues, the more the gamma traders will tame the volatility of the shares as they add to short positions when shares go up, and exit short positions when shares go down — all to stay as delta neutral as possible. In other words, they inadvertently pave the way for their own future indifference to the company, to the company’s concern. While trading at a premium to the company’s net assets is highly advantageous given the treasury strategy pursued by MicroStrategy, it has to be remembered that MicroStrategy’s ability to buy Bitcoin mainly occurs in such good times as well, after Bitcoin has already gone up in price. In other words, the advantage is often offset to a degree. The June 2021 convertible debt issue was the last one in nearly three years, owing to the brutal downturn starting in the beginning of 2022. MicroStrategy, riskier to lenders as the valuation of its underlying assets falls while its debt obligations stay the same, could not take true advantage of a low price of the asset it so highly believed in. By not issuing convertible debt in 2022 or 2023, the company could only make smaller Bitcoin purchases from past issuance, from small proceeds of the software business, and from small issues of shares and of debt with Bitcoin as collateral. To further make the point, the three largest bond issues to date have all occurred when Bitcoin was near its all-time high at the time, in February 2021, in September 2024, and in November 2024. MicroStrategy is tied to the mast when a storm hits, and can walk around on deck only in calm waters. The decline in the cost basis of its Bitcoin holdings, when it happened, was always negligible. The endpoint of this dynamic first makes itself known in longer market downturns. Debt must always be paid back. As MicroStrategy’s convertible debt is raised mainly in good times, it should go without saying that the fact that the size of it persists while the value of the asset it bought can fall, means balance sheet distress is a real possibility. Paying back the debt in the future may lead to very high dilution, at or below net asset value, or to the raising of new debt at exorbitant interest rates due to debt overhang as lenders demand yield in proportion to the risk they take on. In 2021, when the company’s balance sheet was not in distress, lenders demanded over 6% on straight bonds. Should none of these alternatives prove feasible, selling company assets may be the only option left for MicroStrategy. Since its only assets are the hoarded Bitcoin, those are what’s going to hit the bid on the open market in a frantic fire sale, where MicroStrategy must sell at any price. This is one possible endpoint of shares losing their premium to net asset value; falling below previously reached bond issue conversion prices, one after another, paves the way for the fire sale of pristine assets to creditors. What previously proudly was proclaimed “permanent capital”, then morphs into anything but. The claim could perhaps have been made should MicroStrategy’s balance sheet have contained no debt, but that is not the case. In a twist of irony not unfamiliar to Michael Saylor, the forced selling of assets, while making a mockery of previous “permanent capital” statements, would also be conducted in the light of previous arrogance shown the short sellers now about to flock. Saylor has famously begged people to short his company, because “they will have to buy our shares when we need them to.” Potentially on its head, Saylor would have to sell his permanent capital “when creditors and short sellers need him to.” Once this has occurred, it will be very hard to start up Bitcoin yield generation again as retail investors hesitate to bid up shares to a premium. While a 25% debt ratio may be of no immediate danger, the euphoria emerging from a Bitcoin bull market, combined with dreams of imminent hyperbitcoinization, may very well see this ratio creep up at a time when it should rather decrease. An increasing debt ratio would come hand in hand with an even faster increasing cost basis for the company Bitcoin. Any prolonged market downturn would then be able to cause severe damage, and Saylor might yet come to regret ever uttering the phrase “volatility is vitality”. The picture emerging in mainly Washington Post articles from 1999 and 2000 is clear enough to draw some final conclusions when tying together the past with what we can observe in the present. Though journalists often have to put a flair on things, to put it lightly, Michael Saylor’s own way of talking and his own actions are hard to twist. The man back then showed definite signs of being a cult leader, and the word “cult” is mentioned many times in articles from those days, long before the obscure mentions of cyber hornets and encrypted energy, and the daily posts of AI generated images of himself. Whether or not the word applies today, I leave for the reader to judge. Saylor’s convoluted analogies could capture a room full of educated people back then, and they do it today as well. Coming in new shapes and forms, investor hype for “proactive intelligence” morphed into investor hype for “intelligent leverage”. The likelihood that the company eventually will face a second collapse is high enough to stay far away. -- -- 1 Bitcoin. Austrian Economics. Monetary History.

Title: More Reasons for Cautious Optimism About the Demise of The Green Energy Fantasy
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2024/12/25/more-reasons-for-cautious-optimism-about-the-demise-of-the-green-energy-fantasy/
Time Published: 2024-12-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the MANHATTAN CONTRARIAN Francis Menton My post on Saturday noted one big reason for optimism that the green energy fantasy is coming to the end of its run: the first country, Germany, has apparently begun to hit the green energy “wall.” Although Germany has never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar, its ability to continue its green energy dreams has stalled: its electricity prices have soared, its manufacturing sector has been seriously undermined, its economy is in recession, and recently its green-promoting government has fallen. Its failed example now stands for others to see and avoid. And as I look around at developments since the election, I see a number of other reasons to reinforce my cautious optimism. Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances” On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel” On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New Jersey Also on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe It looks as if the green energy bandwagon may be slowing in America. However, in Europe, it’s still full steam ahead. Ed Miliband is utterly determined that Britain will be the first lemming off the edge of the cliff and will do absolutely anything to achieve this. He wouldn’t care if a million Britons froze to death in winter if his insane climate goals were achieved. Miliband is not dictator for life. The UK is still a democracy and the voters will be heard. The outcome of the Labour foolishness is predetermined – it is only a matter of time before the voters demand change. The support for Net Zero will only end in the UK when the actual electricity grid cannot support the population and randomly fails during the coldest weather. Therefore Labour/Conservative/LibDem alliance is in not danger at the moment. It’s probably going to be more problematic as Rachel from Complaints will have to raise more taxes in April at the current rate of progress. In the mean time percentage on ZE vehicles being sold rises as total sales of cars falls. That part of the plan is working well. The UK is not a functional democracy since the choices we have are limited and as many already know, the Davos Uniparty have infected our system so all the main parties are variants of socialism. But the fastest growing party Reform gives us hope as while they may have got only 5 MPs, their proportion of the vote was higher than the LimpDumbs who got the third highest number of MPs. Reform were very close to winning a lot of seats that went to Labour in the north and are close to Tory seats in the south. The local council elections in May will be a popularity poll on our Student Union government and the signs are they will get hammered. That could bring about a new leader for Labour. As for the inexperienced Rachel from Accounts/Complaints? She might be toast come the spring as the UK will be in recession with inflation rising and interest rates stuck, but more importantly government bond rates will be high and that drives the mortgage interest rates which ‘working people’ – something Labour have struggled to define – will be feeling. You are almost right. actually, all political parties are variants of socialism and this includes Reform. I see a small chink of light growing as the notion of independents takes root. This is where the future of the right lays. Eventually, we will see democracy by the people, of the people, and for the people. Aren’t lemmings closely related to ‘rats’? RATS was the last UK coal fired power station (Ratcliffe on Soar). A target of 50% “green” energy – in itself, difficult to achieve – would have reduced CO2 emissions by, errr… 50%, but zealots are never happy, for them it’s 100% or nothing – except, of course, that it never can be 100%. That’s why I doubt the sanity of people like Red Ed Miliband. The most dangerous man since that bloke in Germany some while back… Happy Christmas everyone! Actually, it is doubtful that “green energy” (whatever that is**) reduces CO2 emission much at all The US reduced its CO2 emissions by converting coal to gas. Germany and the UK have reduced their emissions by destroying their manufacturing base and sending it to China , India etc, probably increasing the overall CO2 released. ** wind and solar are the exact opposite of “green”.. Both are hugely environmentally polluting at every stage… mining , manufacture (absolutely horrendous), installation (environmentally destructive), usage (avian destruction), and final disposal in landfill , or left to rot in place. I don’t disagree, Brice, I was just arguing on the “Even if one accepts that “green” energy is desireable…” basis in order to underline Miliband’s madness in trying to get to 100%. I agree Bnice, Green and Energy do not belong together as the result is an oxymoron! The Greens have had enough say about what they want about energy, now it’s time for the rest of us ordinary people-90% to demand, cheap reliable electricity by whatever means are available, be it fossil fuels, hydro, nuclear and even solar in moderation. None of this energy business has anything to do with climate change, so people get over this non- existent fake environmental climate crisis. If we don’t get a positive response about our cheap energy requirements from responsible governments, we will vote them out sooner rather than later. First was the US then Germany and Australia will follow if they are smart enough in 2025! However, in the UK, Labour is totally delusional about energy, so the process will take longer unless the people riot or occupy the House of Commons. Just yesterday in another thread that Warren Beeton fool was trying gaslight me, claiming that steel manufacturing with electric blast furnaces was feasible. They can’t even keep the lights on now, how is uninterrupted power for molten steel possible with wind turbines? Any manufacturer trying this insanity would be quickly out-of-business. Swedish SSAB plans to be the first steel company in the world to deliver ‘fossil free steel’ to the market on a commercial scale in 2026. How successful and competitively priced it will be remains to be seen. Access to plentiful hydro electric power is probably essential. I want to see what the metallurgy reports on this hydrogen-reduced steel say. How they overcome the embrittlement problem has been mostly a hand-wave in the press releases. I am not sure I want to live on the 12th floor of a high-rise made with H2Steel. Agree. SSAB have been collaborating with Mercedes for some time so I think steel for vehicle production will be their initial step. According to current data, around 70% of steel in the United States is manufactured using electric arc furnaces (EAFs), which are considered electric furnaces; this means a significant majority of American steel production relies on electric furnaces. Big River Steel In 2024, this facility in Osceola, Arkansas became the first steel plant in the world to receive ResponsibleSteel certification. ResponsibleSteel is a nonprofit that audits companies’ progress toward “net-zero steel” production. Big River Steel also gets more than 60% of its electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources. THAT IS THE CLOSEST TO GREEN STEEL IN THE US. I did a Bing search on electric arc furnaces and found that these are used for recycling scrap steel. Blast furnaces are still used for smelting iron ore. Didn’t find any info on use of hydrogen for smelting iron ore. I recall reading awhile back that a pilot process for smelting iron ore with hydrogen malfunctioned, resulting in an explosion that killed a worker and injured several other workers. particularly for reducing iron to make steel possible, a coking furnace is required. After the iron is in the right oxidation state it really doesn’t matter how one heats it for the final mix. The innovation is with using hydrogen as the reducing agent, but any hydrogen left in the matrix will lead to brittle steal that won’t hold up to stresses as well as the traditional carbon-reduced steal. I doubt that Millivolt is insane, atticman. But he has a very low (and alas accurate) assessment of how well British education prepares the population for critical thinking. In plain sight, he and Sir Stalin are obliterating the ancient rights of Englishmen along with the utter replacement of Englishmen. I don’t believe that it is the accidental outcome of insanity. But indeed, happy Christmas! Turn to thoughts of hope and joy. ancient rights- maybe time for a constitution and bill of rights? nobody pitching for that? Perhaps not – we wouldn’t be $34T in debt if our Federales had actually been constrained by our Constitution. How often is it even 50% in Germany? Under ideal conditions only? At night in windy weather? If it’s only under ideal conditions- it would be useful to get the average for all the hours in a year. Even if “green energy” was to reach 50%, the CO2 “reduction” wouldn’t be anywhere close to 50%. This is because fossil fuel plants need to kept on warm standby, at a minimum, so that they can take over whenever “green energy” fails. I’ve seen no blowback from Microsoft’s announcement that they will be reopening Three Mile Island — certainly a good sign. Yes, I agree it’s a good thing. I hope Microsoft has employed some experienced “restart” experts who know what they are getting into. I have no knowledge of Three Mile Island’s current mechanical condition. However, recommissioning equipment that has sat idle, unpowered and/or unmaintained for any number of years can quickly become uneconomical. I’m not sure you just walk back in and flip on the switches. Microsoft isn’t restarting Three Mile Island, they contracted to use the electricity, if I’m not mistaken. Doesn’t someone have to restart it first? Reactor 1 was running until 2019. Thanks Bob. Those that haven’t kept up could start here: Restarting Three Mile Island: Quick Facts “Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both.” The myopic obsession with the physics of the so-called “greenhouse effect” must come to an end one way or another. And the physics of electrical power generation and hydrocarbon fuels cannot be faked. It may take a few more years for this to be fully realized, but it is from the physics of the general circulation that the claims of GHG “warming” are directly refuted. Are rising concentrations of CO2 capable of “forcing” absorbed energy to accumulate down here (i.e. “warming.”) as sensible heat gain in the land + ocean + atmosphere system? No. Energy conversion explains why not. [internal energy + potential energy] is constantly being converted to/from [kinetic energy]. Lorenz described this concept. The ERA5 reanalysis model explicitly computes it. More here. Please read the full text description of this very short time-lapse video. I will paste that full text in a reply. In my view, this is important for skeptics of the climate movement to understand. https://youtu.be/hDurP-4gVrY The text description for that video. ************ Are CO2 emissions a risk to the climate? No. The static “warming” effect of incremental CO2 (~4 W/m^2 for 2XCO2) disappears as kinetic energy (wind) is converted to/from internal energy (including temperature) + potential energy (altitude). This time lapse video shows the daily minimum, median, and maximum values of the computed “vertical integral of energy conversion” hourly parameter from the ERA5 reanalysis for 2022. Values for each 1/4 degree longitude gridpoint at 45N latitude are given. The vertical scale is from -10,000 to +10,000 W/m^2. The minor incremental radiative absorbing power of non-condensing GHGs such as CO2, CH4, and N2O vanishes on the vertical scale as the rapidly changing energy conversion in both directions is tens to thousands of times greater. So what? The assumed GHG “forcings” cannot be isolated for reliable attribution of reported surface warming. And with all the circulation and energy conversion throughout the depth of the troposphere, heat energy need not be expected to accumulate on land and in the oceans to harmful effect from incremental non-condensing GHGs. The GHGs add no energy to the land + ocean + atmosphere system. Therefore the radiative properties of CO2, CH4, and N2O, and other molecules of similar nature, should not be assumed to produce a perturbing climate “forcing.” The concept of energy conversion helps us understand the self-regulating delivery of energy to high altitude for just enough longwave radiation to be emitted to space. References: The ERA5 reanalysis model is a product of ECMWF, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The computed parameters “vertical integral of potential + internal energy” and “vertical integral of energy conversion” are described at these links. https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162061 https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162064 Further comment: This is for just one latitude band at 45N. Similar results were observed for 45S, 10N/S, 23.5N/S, and 66N/S. More Background: From Edward N. Lorenz (1960) “Energy and Numerical Weather Prediction” https://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v12i4.9420 “2. Energy, available potential energy, and gross static stability Of the various forms of energy present in the atmosphere, kinetic energy has often received the most attention. Often the total kinetic energy of a weather system is regarded as a measure of its intensity. The only other forms of atmospheric energy which appear to play a major role in the kinetic energy budget of the troposphere and lower stratosphere are potential energy, internal energy, and the latent energy of water vapor. Potential and internal energy may be transformed directly into kinetic energy, while latent energy may be transformed directly into internal energy, which is then transformed into kinetic energy. It is easily shown by means of the hydrostatic approximation that the changes of the potential energy P and the internal energy l of the whole atmosphere are approximately proportional, so that it is convenient to regard potential and internal energy as constituting a single form of energy. This form has been called total potential energy by Margules (1903). … In the long run, there must be a net depletionof kinetic energy by dissipative processes. It follows that there must be an equal net generation of kinetic energy by reversible adiabatic processes; this generation must occur at the expense of total potential energy. It follows in turn that there must be an equal net generation of total potential energy by heating of all kinds. These three steps comprise the basic energy cycle of the atmosphere. The rate at which these steps proceed is a fundamental characteristic of the general circulation.” ************** Yep, as I keep saying, “There are no free lunches in physics.” I concur. It seems to me the most realistic mechanism. The uncertainty comes w the attribution equations which rely on assumed mechanisms that cannot be properly equated as in essense one cannot separate the signals as one could in a lab. That guesswork is fine as far as im concerned. The issue is w politics in regards to ‘settled science’. I understand that particular mechanism. In order to implement impactful policies you A: create a narrative of ‘settled science’ and act like a religious group w a control/ comply structure, coupled w B: a fear of Armageddon and percecution of heretics. People are fed up with woke left wing insanity. There’s some evidence that led to Trump’s election, and the Republicans taking both senate and house. Peter Zeihan points out that the voting patterns in the election weren’t typical. … it means the culture war is a big determining factor on how people vote … Folks who have enough education can convince themselves that CAGW is a serious problem, that Anthony Fauci is a hero, and that a woman can have a penis. Fortunately, the majority of voters know better. Defund the universities. This video, Why Smart People Believe Stupid Things, is worth a look. I don’t think it’s clear that Republicans have a firm grip on the Senate. Too many RINOs can still spoil the soup. And isn’t the House majority even narrower than it was before the election? True but even just a one seat majority means control of all the committees which means bad democrat legislative junk will seldom get to the floor for a vote. Why sources always brag on renewable wind and solar Capacity rather than actual production? 2023 annual World wind production 2.33 milllion GWh; wind capacity 1017.2 GW ((2,330,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1017.2)) equals actual production of 26.14% of Capacity. 2023 annual World Solar production 1.64 milllion GWh; solar capacity 1419.0 GW ((1.640,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1419.0)) equals actual production of 13.2% of Capacity. 2023 annual combined World production 3.97 milllion GWh; combined capacity 2436.2 GW ((3.970,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/2436.2)) equals actual production of 18.6% of Capacity. 2023 Wind and Solar renewable production was 18.6% of capacity and I suspect that 2024 will be some what lower. Depending on the source wind and Solar contributed 11-13.4% of total world electricity production during 2023. Forgot the sources: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-energy-consumption-vs-installed-wind-energy-capacity https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-energy-consumption-vs-solar-pv-capacity And specifically for Germany:  Wind Energy: Around 142.1 TWh, which accounted for approximately 27% of Germany’s total electricity consumption in 2023.  Solar Energy: Approximately 59.9 TWh, which should account for roughly 11-12% of the total electricity consumption. Germany wind and solar are both grid saturated according to “The Pollack Limit” discussed at length a couple years ago here on WUWT. The Wind CF in Germany is right at 27% and Solar at 12%.Time to give it up, it was an irresponsible waste of capital up to this point, continuing the insanity is well, insane. The new German ruling Coalition after The February 2025 will surely early on end the energewende.. Leftist fantasies never end but eventually they run out of other people’s money to waste. In the US the investment growth rate for wind power is slow. But solar power and EV investment growth rates still far too high: The United States’ solar energy capacity has been growing rapidly in recent years, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projecting a 75% increase in solar power capacity from 2023 to 2025 In 2023, the United States’ wind capacity increased by 4% from 2022, reaching a total of 147.5 gigawatts (GW). This is a 10% average annual increase since 2010, when the capacity was 45 GW. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects wind capacity to increase by 7 gigawatts (GW) in 2024, which is a 5% increase from the previous year. This would bring the total wind capacity in the U.S. to 153.8 GW by the end of 2024. In 2024, the US is expected to invest $312 billion in EV manufacturing, with $223 billion already allocated to specific initiatives. This is a nearly $66 billion increase from January 2023 All cash down the crapper. Oh, and “capacity” does not equal production. The percentage increase of investment correlates with the percentage increase of capacity. Exactly. It has absolutely nothing to do with electricity actually generated that can be used when generated. Yes — Greene can’t read. Number of bad investments correlates well with number of government investments. Germany may have fatally damaged its manufacturing base as companies close or announce job cuts or relocations out of Germany virtually every week. Sky high energy costs mean that a twelfth of the population are not able to fund a full year forcing consideration to be given to banning disconnections for non-payment even if only during the winter months. Energy companies in the UK are facing an increasing amount of customers in debt and these may be pushed on to those of us who are paying, as if our costs were not high enough already. Many of the companies that haven’t moved or downsized already, are having trouble finding enough money to maintain their equipment, much less modernize it. This will hamper those companies in the future. Germany is poised to begin repairing Merkel’s damage: (It won’t be easy and it won’t be quick). Christoph Strack 4 hours ago4 hours ago Friedrich Merz, an erstwhile rival of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been a beacon of hope for the conservative CDU party. He now wants to unseat Chancellor Olaf Scholz and take over as Germany’s leader. Merz has always been a supporter of nuclear energy and has expressed doubts over renewable energy sources such as “ugly” wind turbines. He drew flak in 2022 for flying his private jet to attend Finance Minister Christian Lindner’s wedding on the island of Sylt at a time of rising energy prices caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine. Merz has also been accused of pandering to the far right with denigrating remarks about refugees. He represents a CDU that has become more conservative, although he has stated his refusal to cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).(We’ll see about that, I think he’ll change his mind, he must IMHO) Shortly after Germany’s center-left government collapsed on November 6, 2024, Merz stated in clear terms that the years of Scholz’s coalition were now history, arguing that this had been a long time coming. Merz is hoping that he and the CDU/CSU will replace Olaf Scholz and his minority government with the Greens following the February 23 election. It remains to be seen which coalition partners he would choose to form a new government. The renewable energy business has been built on lies pure and simple. If we had the strength to hold government, media and academia accountable we wouldn’t be in this mess. If we held individuals accountable and didn’t allow them to hide behind their organizations all of this would end. Remove the free money, remove the commitment. The clear indicator of a specious cause. RE has always been a means for the wealthy to extract public money through subsidies, never about reducing CO2 emissions. I am optimistic for a different reason. For years, it seemed like the climate skeptics spoke alone, and in a disjointed fashion, making no headway with GQ public. Now, I’m watching organizations pull together, and some even coordinate their efforts. Recently, someone told me that 20% of people are hypnotized idiots, 20% question everything, and 60% can be convinced with logic but mostly they just go along with whichever group is loudest. By coordinating efforts, we can appear to be the winners and pull in the 60%. Just a thought about “ never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar” A true but misleading statement. “Electricity production” is not full-time electric service–as we are used to and require. “Electricity” from intermittent, sporadic machines does not/cannot provide full time, on-demand electric service. (for typical residential, commercial, industrial use). To contribute at all, solar and wind must connect to a grid of rotating generation from coal, natural gas, oil, large hydro, or nuclear. With specialized equipment at various grid locations calculated for reliability, stability and regulation. AC frequency, voltage, current, reactances, and other instant (frequency in HZ or AC cycles are usually 1/50 or 1/60 of a second. A transmission grid or distribution network requires controls that continuously monitor and take stabilizing actions as needed to provide AC within best engineering practices. Best engineering practices used to include lowest capital, construction, and operational costs. Sadly no longer used. Do not be surprised if they invent something new to kick start the mad rush to One World Order.

Title: The work trends that dominated the headlines in 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-24T21:06:39Z

Ghost jobs. Coffee badging. Quiet firing. Quiet vacationing. The buzziest workplace trends this year didn't just become well-known tropes but also highlighted an ongoing power struggle between workers and bosses after the pandemic shook up the way people do their jobs. The year's biggest movements reflect "shifts in work models, technological integration, and employee expectations," says Lauren Winans, CEO and HR consultant at Next Level Benefits. While some of these are by no means new fads, they all featured prominently in the discourse around work this year. Here are the trends that dominated the cultural conversation in 2024: Ghost jobs are nothing new but got a lot of attention this year. These are roles which employers claim to be looking to fill even though they may not actually be hiring for such positions. Employers may list ghost jobs for a few reasons. They might want to suggest they're doing well and growing; they could be trying to ready a talent pool for actual positions opening in the future; or they may want to imply to overworked employees that they'll get some additional help soon. This one pretty much explains itself, but just in case: When employees go on vacation without using any time off or telling their bosses, they're said to be quiet vacationing. Return-to-office mandates continued rolling out at big firms this year. Amazon, one of the country's biggest employers, became one of the highest-profile companies to announce a full 5-day-a-week return to the office. (Its implementation has been delayed for some employees though, due to a lack of space.) As employers tightened the reins on remote work, some employees started carving out a new working arrangement under the table. Enter the hushed hybrid schedule, in which employees skirt RTO mandates by getting their manager's approval to continue working from home on days they're technically required to be in the office. Managers, for their part, might agree to do this to keep their employees happy (or to keep them, period). They also probably have a more personal connection with the workers affected by a mandate than the executives enforcing it. And of course, managers who are themselves opposed to RTO plans might also cut employees some slack out of sympathy. Another method of evading RTO is coffee badging — though it still technically requires that an employee return to the office. The practice involves going to work to swipe your badge so your attendance is logged. But instead of spending the rest of the workday there, you kill some time by grabbing a coffee, or showing face with a quick lap around the office, before returning home to do most of your actual work there. Performance improvement plans, or PIPs, usually consist of a series of goals set for an employee to improve in areas where a boss says they're underperforming. If they're not completed in the allotted time, usually a few months or less, the employee will face termination. PIPs are certainly not unique this year but statistically have been more frequently issued in recent years. They got renewed attention in 2024 as part of the discussion around ways employers trim headcount unannounced. Yes, these are all somehow different things. Between RTO mandates and PIPs, "quiet firing," which gained a lot of buzz in recent years, stayed in the spotlight in 2024. It refers to a boss or employer's unspoken attempt to encourage employees to quit by making the role more uncomfortable, as opposed to facing the monetary and reputational costs associated with explicitly laying them off. Related phrases include "silent layoffs," which refers to giving employees severance packages but asking them to be discreet about their exiting the firm. There's also "stealth sackings," coined by the Financial Times to describe firing employees over minor offenses. The newspaper cited Meta's dismissal of two dozen staff for using $25 GrubHub meal credits to buy non-food items as an example, and EY's firing of dozens of staffers for watching multiple online training courses simultaneously. There were also other trends that, though they lack flashy names, also shaped how we worked in 2024. The main one, of course, was the growing adoption of AI in the workplace, the "standout trend" of the year, according to Amy Schabacker Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute and the Human Resource Standards Institute. Winans says other trends included an emphasis on upskilling and reskilling to keep up with technological advancements and changing job requirements, as well as increased labor organizing efforts. Next year, the integration of AI at work will no doubt continue. "Employees expect training and transparency about AI's role, while employers navigate concerns about job security and ethics," says Dufrane. Other themes to watch include an emphasis on skills-based hiring and employee wellness programs, as well as ongoing changes to companies' ESG and DEI strategies. Employee engagement in the US hitting an 11-year low in 2024, coupled with the possibility it may be easier to change jobs in 2025 mean that revenge quitting may also be the next big thing in workplace trends come next year, according to a Glassdoor report. The phrase refers to dissatisfied employees being vocal with their discontent and resigning, often with little or no notice, knowing it could negatively impact their employer. Heading into 2025, "monitoring employee satisfaction will be more important than ever," says Dufrane. "We may see an increase in trends like bare-minimum attendance or revenge quitting as return-to-work mandates require employees to be on-site more than the post-COVID norm," she adds. "Prioritizing open communication, as well as autonomy, fairness, and a high-trust environment, will be critical for organizations to succeed." Jump to

Laid off dozens of workers, according to sources familiar with the decision. The autonomous vehicle technology company has since confirmed that about 3% of its workforce has been laid off. Will lay off 9% of the company’s workforce, affecting about 1,000 full-time employees. In a blog post, the company also plans to cut contract roles in the coming months. Announced it intends to offer voluntary buyouts or job changes to 8,000 employees amid restructuring. Laid off 20% of its staff, affecting 282 workers. In a blog post, Co-CEO Pedro Franceschi said that the company is prioritizing “long-term thinking and ownership over short-term gains in our comp structure.” Eliminated around 60 jobs across the U.S. in Los Angeles, New York, and Austin in addition to layoffs in international markets.

Is cutting 90% of its employees as it shuts down its online used car marketplace and shifts resources into two business units: one focused on auto financing and the other on AI-powered analytics.

Will eliminate 100 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch, as part of a restructuring effort in its creator management and operations teams. Is laying off “hundreds” of employees in its advertising sales team, according to a leaked memo. The cuts come a week after the company did sweeping layoffs across its hardware teams. And more layoffs will come throughout the year, as CEO Sundar Pichai told the company in a memo obtained by the Verge. Reportedly laid off a “sizable” number of employees January 12. The game developer studio was acquired by Borderlands maker Gearbox in 2022. Is going to lay off employees in 2024, TechCrunch exclusively learned, with the total impacted employees potentially reaching as high as 20% of the animation studio’s 1,300 person workforce. The cutbacks come as Disney looks to reduce the studio’s output as it struggles to achieve profitability in streaming. Is laying off 5% of its workforce, citing an “increasingly challenging landscape,” according to a leaked memo obtained by Business Insider. Is laying off 17% of its staff, impacting 170 people. In an internal memo obtained by the Verge, Discord CEO Jason Citron blamed the cuts on the company growing too quickly. Laid off hundreds of employees across its Google Assistant division and the team that manages Pixel, Nest and Fitbit hardware. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are also exiting. Is laying off “several hundreds” of employees at Prime Video and MGM Studios, according to a memo obtained by TechCrunch. The cuts come days after the 500 layoffs at Amazon’s Twitch. Is reportedly laying off 500 employees, 35% of its current staff, amid a continued struggle to achieve profitability in the face of rising costs and community backlash. The pending layoffs come after hundreds more employees were laid off in 2023. Confirmed to TechCunch that layoffs, conducted in December, had impacted 14 employees, accounting for 60% to 70% of the company, according to multiple sources. Confirmed it cut 10% of its contractor workforce at the end of 2023 as it turns to AI to streamline content production and translations previously handled by humans. Will cut about 10% of corporate roles as it goes through a restructuring plan following Anushka Salinas’ planned resignation as operating chief and president at the end of January. Is reducing its workforce by about 25%, or 1,800 people. The video game engine maker went through three rounds of layoffs in 2023. Laid off two-thirds of its employees as the German startup, which built collaborative presentation software, looks to pursue a “completely different path.” CEO and co-founder Christian Reber also stepped down. The AI and biomedical startup reportedly cut 17% of its workforce January 8, citing “shifts in the economic environment,” in a LinkedIn post announcing the layoffs. Eliminated 38% of its staff January 8 as the online retail logistics company follows up after conducting layoffs in September 2023. Announced January 8 it is laying off 28% of its staff, or 154 workers, as the small modular nuclear reactor company shifts its focus to “key strategic areas.” Is reportedly laying off 15% of its workforce focused on computer vision for retailers.

The mass layoff comes just seven months after the startup acquired rival Zencity. Topics Audience Development Producer Cody Corrall is the Audience Development Producer at TechCrunch.

Title: The Biggest TV Stories Of 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-24T18:17:29Z

By Lynette Rice Senior TV Writer Contraction continued to upend the television world in 2024, which also saw the departure of several high profile news anchors, the death of two very beloved soap actors, and the pillorying of a once very successful Nickelodeon producer. The good news? The Paris Olympics were a delight, Dancing with the Stars proved that an old dog still has new tricks, and Ted Lasso isn’t done sharing his pearls of wisdom just yet. Here are the biggest TV stories of 2024. Fans went into the back half of season 5 expecting that something had to be done to address the absence of Kevin Costner, who made it official in June that he was not returning to the Paramount Network drama that relaunched his stardom. But no one expected that creator Taylor Sheridan would go so far as to kill the family patriarch, though it really was the only way to address Costner’s abrupt departure while bringing this version of Yellowstone to a tidy (and massively viewed) close. The contraction continued this year with layoffs at just about every company, including Paramount, Disney, Lionsgate, Televisa Univision, The CW, CAA, UTA, A+E Networks, Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Hallmark, Great American Media, Amazon and CNN. Ryan Murphy’s latest installment to his Monster franchise not only blew away expectations and became a viewership behemoth for the streamer, it cracked the zeitgeist by prompting the L.A. District Attorney’s Office to consider resentencing the brothers who are incarcerated together in San Diego. In the final SNL episode before the election, Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance opposite Maya Rudolph in the cold open — a tiny cameo that would prompt FCC commissioner Brendan Carr to accuse SNL of a “clear and blatant effort” to evade the FCC’s Equal Time Rule, which requires that broadcasters offer comparable time to opposing candidates. NBC ended up giving Donald Trump a spot during NASCAR. Instead of a complete third season, Amazon decided to give Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens a 90-minute sendoff after he was accused of sexual assault by a slew of women. At one point, Gaiman offered to step back so that the series would be able to finish its story. Michael Sheen and David Tennant, who play the angel Aziraphale and demon Crowley, respectively, will return for the one-off television movie that will begin shooting in early 2025 in Scotland. Two of daytime’s most beloved stars died this year — Days of Our Lives‘ veteran Bill Hayes, the actor who played Doug Williams for more than 50 years, and his colleague Drake Hogestyn, who portrayed John Black since 1986. The Morning Joe hosts faced an online backlash after they met with Donald Trump for what they described as a “restart” of their communication with the president-elect to raise concerns about his attacks on the media. Despite the public spanking, Scarborough claimed they’ve been “flooded with [supportive] phone calls from people” after the now infamous meeting. Kurt Sutter — who was fired from FX’s Mayans M.C. in 2019 — got the ‘ol heave-ho yet again in October, this time from his Netflix series The Abandons just three weeks before it was slated to wrap production in Calgary. Sutter was the executive producer/showrunner on the series, which he also created. The departure was believed to stem from creative differences over the direction of the big-scale production — a western that Sutter had always wanted to make. Bro, your fans miss you. Get it together, man! The season that culimated with Jenna Johnson and Joey Graziadei winning the Mirror Ball Trophy was definitely one for the record books. The long-running variety show on ABC hit multiple milestones with its voting, but that was only just the beginning. The November finale broke the fan voting record once again with 32 million votes for the five finalists — 12 million more than what was received for the semi-finals. The Investigation Discovery docuseries that set out to uncover the toxic and dangerous culture on the sets of Dan Schneider’s Nickelodeon children’s shows in the late 1990s and early 2000s was a pearl clutcher for Gen Xers who grew up loving the goofy tween comedies. After the limited series dropped, Schneider apologized for his behavior that was depicted on Quiet On Set and vowed to hold himself accountable for how he acted on his Nickelodeon shows. Then, he sued Warner Bros, Maxine Productions, Sony Pictures and producers Mary Robertson and Emma Schwartz for defamation. Good luck with that, big guy. The strong reaction to the soap’s decision to boot the popular actress who’s played Sam McCall since 2003 was a keen reminder to the broadcast networks that yes, people do still care about their stories. Despite a looming defamation suit and the lingering questions over what should or shouldn’t constitute a “true story” for TV, the semi-autobiographical series Baby Reindeer took home Emmys in September for Best Series, Writing, Actor (Gadd) & Actress (Jessica Gunning). “The show has done some phenomenal things worldwide for so many people,” Gadd told the press after the ceremony. In a major step toward the long-awaited fourth season of Apple TV+’s hugely popular soccer comedy, the series’ studio Warner Bros. Television in August picked up the options for Hannah Waddingham, who plays AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Walton; Brett Goldstein, who plays hardman Roy Kent; and Jeremy Swift, who plays Director of Football Operations Leslie Higgins. If the heavens align, production on a fourth season may start in early 2025. NBC Universal’s coverage of the Paris Olympics was a cornucopia of delight and intrigue, from Celine Dion’s appearance on the Eiffel Tower during the opening ceremony to Stephen Nedoroscik’s stellar performance on the pommel horse for the U.S. Men’s Gymastic Team. Even Raygun of Team Australia — aka the embattled B-girl — became a veritable pop-cultural sensation even though she lost during the round-robin stage of the women’s breaking competition. Also, Snoop Dogg. The NBA and WBD end their months-long legal dispute in November by agreeing to an 11-year partnership for b-ball content. The pact is also meant to accelerate global growth of WBD’s TNT Sports Bleacher Report & House of Highlights. The year saw significant exits from the cable news world. Just this month, Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto announced he was exiting after 28 years with the network. Alisyn Camerota, Poppy Harlow, Chris Wallace and Gloria Borger signed off from CNN, Andrea Mitchell ditched MSNBC, Eric Molling departed Newsmax, and León Krauze and Jorge Ramos left Univision. President Biden’s first and subsequently last debate with Donald Trump in June was a historic game-changer, as his poor performance panicked Democrats into calling for an immediate change to the ticket. VP Kamala Harris stepped up and gave an impressive performance in the next debate against Trump on ABC, but, alas — we know what happened after that. CBS couldn’t help but feel bullish about its development for the 2024-25 season; it had NCIS: Origins, Matlock and Watson in the pipeline in addition to a second season of the Australian NCIS: Sydney. But that meant something had to go. In that case, it was the sleeper hit So Help Me Todd, not to mention NCIS: Hawaii and the legacy powerhouse that is Blue Bloods. Fans revolted with emails and petitions but CBS stood firm by saying things like “everything needs to come to an end sometime” but not acknowledging that NCIS has been on the air since the Dubya administration. Netflix‘s much-hyped matchup between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul took some hits before the former heavyweight champion and the YouTuber even landed their first blows. The event was plagued with glitches because just about every subscriber — and then some — hoped to see the senior Tyson clobber the lippy whippersnapper. Sadly, that didn’t happen. But lots of money was made! The soap world got a huge vote of confidence this year when CBS decided to develop Beyond the Gates, a new daytime series from CBS Studios / NAACP Venture in partnership with P&G Studios. It’s the first one-hour, Black daytime drama to air on television and the first daytime drama to premiere since Passions in 1999. But something had to give to make way for another sudser; the victim was The Talk, which launched in 2010 as CBS’ response to ABC’s The View. The Talk evolved over the years, which included introducing a co-ed panel. But modest ratings and high costs prompted the network to say goodbye to the talker after 15 seasons. In September, Hoda Kotb revealed that she was leaving Today, after co-anchoring since 2018, “I’ve been weighing this decision for quite a while – Am I truly ready? But, my sixtieth birthday celebration on the Plaza felt like a shift. Like a massive, joyful YES, you are! I saw it all so clearly: my broadcast career has been beyond meaningful, a new decade of my life lies ahead, and now my daughters and my mom need and deserve a bigger slice of my time pie.” Her last day is January 10. The FX remake of Shōgun took home a staggering 18 Emmys in September, including one for Outstanding Drama Series. During the acceptance speech for the latter award, Co-creator/executive producer/showrunner Justin Marks thanked Disney and FX executives for greenlighting “a very expensive subtitled Japanese period piece whose central climax revolves around a poetry competition.” The series has been picked up for another season. In a not-so-coincidental turn of events, George Stephanopoulos signed a new deal with ABC News after the network agreed to a $16 million settlement with President-elect Donald Trump, who sued in March over comments that Stephanopoulos made on This Week about the defamation case brought against Trump by writer E. Jean Carroll. A source told Deadline that the new contract was agreed to before the settlement. Sure, Jan. Significant change occurred at the behemoth media companies this year. Warner Bros. Discovery slimmed down from three divisions to two and established a clear separation between linear networks and the streaming and studios businesses. And Comcast formally unveiled plans to spin out most of its linear cable networks (except Bravo) into a separate company, a move that President Mike Cavanagh said puts all of NBCUniversal “on a new growth trajectory.” Norah O’Donnell exited her role as anchor of CBS Evening News after five years in the chair. She had previously been co-anchor of CBS This Morning and, before that, chief White House correspondent. In the meantime, layoffs at Paramount further impacted the network’s news division; CBS Saturday Morning co-host Jeff Glor got the boot, along with Anna Werner, senior consumer investigative correspondent, and Ben Tracy, senior national and environmental correspondent.

Title: The Goal is Higher Testosterone, Not Muscle?
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2024/12/24/the-goal-is-higher-testosterone-not-muscle/
Time Published: 2024-12-24T17:51:26Z
Full Content:
For example ,,, ￼ you would not want to be the world’s most muscular and glorious demigod body if you only got two hours of sleep a night, and felt like you were physiologically dying, and had very low testosterone. ￼ Similarly speaking, it wouldn’t matter if you were like the worlds strongest man, you could lift like 100,000 pounds or whatever, but, once again, you had naturally low mood, low testosterone, and once again only slept two hours a night? So one random thought I have in regards to fitness is the criticality of sleep and recovery. For example, I think I have a simple antidote, to reset your circadian rhythm, or sleep patterns, for dinner, the night prior, eat a shit load of beef ribs. Why beef ribs? First, ancient Greek literature, the Iliad confirms this. ￼￼ For example, when Achilles had his friends joined him in his hut, he carved out the backbone of the ox, often prized, the most choice meat. Also, it is easily accessible, you could find it at any Costco, even Food 4 Less. Even with the price of inflation, it is still affordable, around 499 a pound, or 449 a pound. I found a very very simple recipe, just take a baking tray and cover it with aluminum foil, and you don’t even have to season the ribs or prepare them, just put them directly on the aluminum foil, heat the oven at 325°, let it cook for an hour and a half, and boom you’re done! And then later you could just coat it with some salt pepper and garlic powder, and smoked paprika is actually good too. Anyways, after consuming about two trays of beef ribs, I’ve been sleeping way better, like on average another two or three hours a night, which I feel at least 500% better in the morning? The weird idea is in a lot of self improvement circles is that waking up super early every day, at like 3:30 AM or for whatever is considered virtuous. No. I would actually say that the ultimate virtue and active mainlines is to try to secure at least 8 to 12 hours of sleep a night. Why? Simple biology; assuming that during the day you are doing some sort of physical exercise and weightlifting, then what that then means is that the corresponding rest and recovery time will also be in similar accordance. Also, a simple thoughts; the stronger you become the heavier way to lift, you must also correspondingly spend equal amounts of time stretching, warming up etc. For example on the road to hitting my legendary thousand pound Atlas lift, all of these low testosterone guys would always tell me ￼“be careful”, which was their strange way of trying to feel superior to me that they thought I was doing something foolish in which I actually might injure myself? The simple idea that I have is once again, obviously! The higher weight you go, the more careful you become. And my personal way of mitigating safety was simple; spending at least two or three times more effort stretching warming up, doing dynamic exercise exercises like a bunch of yoga stuff on steroids. And this is where a lot of fools also don’t understand; when that would be warming up for my really really heavy weight lifts, I would also do a lot of calisthenics that looks like I would just do a single muscle up to warm up, planches etc. ￼ So currently my practical thought is the best car or vehicle to own in LA, maybe anywhere in Southern California, maybe even America is probably a white Toyota plug-in Prius prime. Why? First, once again you want to have the best of all worlds! For example, when you become dumb rich, it ain’t about showing off, rather, it is about adding more convenience to your life. For example, you want maximum optionality. What that means is you want to have access to gasoline pumps when necessary, and also you want to have access to electric charging ports when also available. But you don’t want to be dependent on either. ￼ Once again, do you want to have the optional not the dependence. So I just finished reading principles of economics by Saifedean, and one really really fascinating idea I encountered is this idea that perhaps, what if a lot of these doomsday Colts were simply predicated on false science math and philosophical principles? For example, just ChatGPT; what percentage of the earths crust has been mined for oil, and it will spit out an absurdly tiny number. Also all this hysteria when it comes to carbon dioxide and carbon footprint whatever; also once again, just ChatGPT the percentage of carbon in the earths atmosphere, compared to nitrogen which is about 70%, oxygen which is about 20%, and carbon which I think is like .01%? Anyways, I think the biggest issue here is that almost 99.9999% of all these doomsday cults is that once again, the world is going to shit, and it is precisely because we are boiling the earth, carbon footprint, running out of oil etc. But what if I could tell you, that with 100% certainty that human beings will be fine for the next hundred million years on planet earth, and even at the rate we are going, we have only tapped .001% of the earths natural gas and oil supply, in that, we would never run out of natural minerals even for the next hundred billion years? Certainly I cannot make this prediction but this is a thought experiment. If this were the case, then what? ￼￼ anyways, the reason why I think this is important is that even though I am 100% fan of Tesla Elon Musk, the truth is, getting an electric vehicle or a Tesla is more about fashion rather than saving the planet or whatever. Even an ancient Taoist philosophy says this; How dare you have the audacity to think that somehow the planet needs your help? I think there are virtues to arrogance, but also, the arrogant line of thinking that somehow the Earth needs our help, is also an arrogant thought? Sandbox thinking So currently I really really like this idea of a sandbox. The general idea is that what if we lived in the world in which we had unlimited time unlimited resources, essentially god mode, then how would we proceeded and live life? ￼￼ first, I think 99.9999% of the current modern-day misery that most humans face is body poverty. It don’t matter if you make seven figures or eight figures at Google, at Apple, Meta or Facebook whatever; it seems that almost all these people that I know who work in tech, all of them have extreme bodily poverty? Once again, not enough time weightlifting, too much time jerking off to VR porn, or going on Reddit late at night, with incognito browser on, or their VPN on with pirate bay, whatever it may be. Also, not enough meat consumption. All of these bizarre virtues signaling folks with plant-based diets whatever. Also once again, this anti-sleep mentality, the strange idea that sleeping is a vice? I find everybody on all sides of the political spectrum bad. Republicans and Democrats are bad, Libertarians are bad, moderates are bad etc. The left the right the alt left the alt right whatever. ￼ I don’t know any independent thinkers. All thinkers are dependent on others, nobody stands on their own two feet. I think currently the only independent thinkers that I appreciate and love include Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos, Michael Saylor, NASSIM Taleb etc. But once again, these individuals are good role models but not the end in itself. For example you could spend 100,000 years studying Elon Musk but the truth of the matter is you do not want to become Elon Musk. Why? The critical issue here is he has extreme body poverty until you see him topless on a yacht, with a golden bronze tan, and a six pack, don’t follow him. In some ways Jeff Bezos might be a better guide, look at him, he’s so fucking jacked. But then again I’m pretty sure that Bezos is on the juice, I’m sure he trains good, but he also does steroids good. Michael Saylor is a good example, he knows the virtues of intermittent fasting, and at the age of 59 he looks great! But I also think that maybe he could get into weightlifting; I want to see a sleeveless Michael Saylor with huge guns. MSTR FOLKS email me at Eric@erickim.com for tips So some simple training ideas: First, killing 10 birds with one stone. What that means is just go on a morning walk around town, with your 60 pound weight vest on! Titan.fitness is good ￼ Also, a very simple thing you could do is just get those wooden gymnast rings, you get on Amazon or Titan fitness, and just hook it up in your garage or backyard your front lawn, on a tree, your parking spot whatever ,,, and with your 60 pound weighted vest on, just do a few ups dips, “skin the cat”, Essentially an exercise in which you’re holding the rings you do kind of a backflip and un backflip it again, planches etc. ￼ Currently I think actually one of the most underrated exercises is the rack pull. Essentially, you rack your barbell at around waist level, and then you load it up with weights, and then you kind of do like a mini hip thrust, and you just get it off the rack for like half an inch and you’re done. Imagine like doing like a super mini deadlift, but it is far superior because you don’t have to deal with racking and unracking the weights annoyingly off the floor, and also, the transfer injury is almost nailed because there is not much load on your lower back. A rack pull is more like a hip thrust, meets thigh exercise, meets upper back and trap exercise? ￼ Another very simple one is the Atlas lift, once again, you don’t have to squat all the way down. You just rack up the weight, like you’re doing a squad, and the only goal is to just lift it up half an inch. For the fools who say this don’t do nothing, I have like the most insanely jacked legs thighs calves quads of all time and once again I’m not on steroids. It don’t matter if they are vegan plant-based, professional or whatever, everyone is on steroids! Even your favorite vegan power lifter and weightlifter is on steroids! Even your favorite yoga instructor or calisthenics or CrossFit instructor is also on steroids. Note, steroids are vegan! Ha ha. My massage therapist Aaron at massage envy in Beverly Hills, 100% recommended, told me something interesting that all body mechanics are pretty much the same, but the only difference is our levels of fitness. Also he encouraged me that because I am so physically active, to once again, the more physically active you become, the more time you must also dedicate to stretching mobility work etc. As an investor, you need to have big balls and high testosterone, good mood, good sleep, good physiological and mental health. The primary issue is that a lot of these degenerate traders, have very very poor physical and physiological health. If you’re checking prices like 100 times a day, this is bad. I would actually make the argument if you’re like a single person, and assuming that you’re trading bitcoin and investing a micro strategy stock whatever, the intelligence strategy is if you want to get your mind off things, invest in your physical fitness and health 10x. What that then means is like spend maximum time outside, outdoors, walking outside in the elements, go on nice hikes, be a nature, spend some time with the gym or weightlifting at home, essentially embrace a natural lifestyle. Also, quit marijuana, alcohol. These are all bad toxins. Just be sober. When in Doubt, Buy More Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed higher Tuesday in thin trading ahead of the Christmas holiday, as tech stocks continued their strong start to the week. At 1:00 p.m. ET (18:00 GMT), both S&P 500 rose 1.1%, the Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%, or 350 points. The New York Stock Exchange is set to close early Tuesday for Christmas Eve, and the market is shut on Christmas Day. Tech added to its strong start to the week as the so-called Mag 7 including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) climbed, though NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) traded flat. Chip stocks, which racked up stocks gains a day earlier, were marginally higher Biden after the Biden administration launched a new trade investigation into Chinese-made legacy chips, which could elad to fresh tariffs on Chinese semiconductors. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) shares were flat recovering intraday loss Tuesday as the airline briefly grounded all flights in the U.S. due to a "technical issue." The ground stop was later lifted. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) slipped, halting its recovery from a recent plunge that was triggered by results from a late-stage study of its weight loss drug that fell of expectations. BofA Securities stated its clients continued to buy US equities for the seventh straight week. Specifically, inflows reached $10 billion – the second-largest amount since 2008 and the biggest since January 2017. Similar to recent weeks, purchases were spread across both individual stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with stronger inflows directed toward single stocks. Large-cap stocks saw the bulk of the buying activity, while small caps experienced more subdued inflows. Institutional and retail investors increased their equity holdings for another week – the third for institutions and the second for retail clients. In contrast, hedge funds were net sellers for the second consecutive week. The rolling four-week average of inflows from institutional clients hit its highest point in nine months, reflecting a typical pattern of renewed buying activity following October’s tax-loss selling by mutual funds. “Private clients typically are big sellers in December amid tax loss selling vs. big net buyers in January. While this group has been a buyer of ETFs this month, it has sold single stocks, though slightly less so than in the average December,” BofA strategists led by Jill Carey Hall noted.

Institutional investors and professional traders rely on The Fly to keep up-to-the-second on breaking news in the electric vehicle and clean energy space, as well as which stocks in these sectors that the best analysts on Wall Street are saying to buy and sell. Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter From the hotly-debated high-flier Tesla (TSLA), Wall Street’s newest darling Rivian (RIVN), traditional-stalwarts turned EV-upstarts GM (GM) and Ford (F) to the numerous SPAC-deal makers that have come public in this red-hot space, The Fly has you covered with “Charged,” a weekly recap of the top stories and expert calls in the sector. Q4 DELIVERIES: Barclays expects Tesla to report Q4 deliveries of 515,000 units, up 6% year-over-year and just above the consensus estimate of 511,000. A beat could keep the stock’s narrative momentum strong, but the focus on Tesla’s fundamentals is limited overall, the firm tells investors in a research note. Barclays believes a slight near-term volume miss “would likely do little to dampen” Tesla’s autonomous vehicle and artificial intelligence push, which it says has recently come into greater focus ahead of the planned “Unsupervised FSD” launch in 2025. Conversely, a slight beat on Q4 is likely immaterial to the majority of the current Tesla bull case, the firm adds. It keeps an Equal Weight rating on Tesla with a $270 price target. NOT AS POSITIVE: Barclays also said it believes the post-election rally in shares of Tesla reflects a “sharp disconnect” between the stock and the company’s fundamentals. Technicals and options are playing an outsized role in the rally, the firm tells investors in a research note. Barclays believes Tesla shares are now best comped to crypto. There are little incremental positives to Tesla’s fundamentals from the election, but Elon Musk’s premium is now elevated, contends the firm. The last six weeks “serve as a reminder that Tesla remains a narrative king within the market, with fundamentals cast aside,” it adds. While 2025 consensus earnings estimates are up slightly in the past six weeks, Tesla’s multiple has increased to a “frothy” 145-times 2025 numbers, up from 80-times immediately pre-election, Barclays points out. It calls Trump’s “not as positive as you’d think” for Tesla’s fundamentals. The firm keeps an Equal Weight rating on Tesla with a $270 price target. AV DEPLOYMENT: Tesla is in early talks with the authorities in the city of Austin, Texas, about its autonomous vehicle technology, Bloomberg’s Kara Carlson reports. A Tesla employee has been in touch with the city’s autonomous vehicle task force since at least May to establish safety expectations for the vehicles, the report says, citing emails acquired by public records requests. Click here to check out Tesla’s recent Media Buzz Sentiment as measured by TipRanks. SOLAR INDUSTRY: Roth MKM notes that the American Active Anode Material Producers has filed anti-dumping and countervailing duty petitions against imports of active anode material from China with alleged average dumping margins from 828%-921%, adding that the firm believes this case could have “a wide range of impacts” as the petition covers active anode material regardless of whether it is imported independently, as part of a compound, or in a battery. Roth, which believes the anode typically represents about 10%-15% of the cost of a battery, says a potential added tariff cost could be “disruptive to the industry” and a negative for suppliers that source anode material from China, directly or indirectly. Some names that the firm says could be impacted include Fluence Energy (FLNC), Stem (STEM), Enphase (ENPH), SolarEdge (SEDG), Energy Vault (NRGV), Clearway Energy (CWEN), Enlight (ENLT), Ormat (ORA), Sunnova (NOVA) and Sunrun (RUN). BUY SUNRUN: TD Cowen initiated coverage of Sunrun with a Buy rating and $21 price target. The company is positioned to drive contracted subscriber value growth, supported by higher battery attachment and investment tax credit levels along with fixed cost absorption, through its scale and “leading” residential solar financier market share, the firm tells investors in a research note. TD Cowen says Sunrun will raise non-recourse debt against contracted subscriber value, providing confidence its 2025 cash generation targets are achievable.

Title: Hennessy Predicts 2025 Will Be Good Year For Mid-Cap Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lcarrel/2024/12/24/hennessy-predicts-2025-will-be-good-year-for-mid-cap-stocks/
Time Published: 2024-12-24T15:02:35Z

Portfolio managers of the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund, from left, Joshua Wien, Ryan Kelley, ... [+] Neil Hennessy discussing stocks in the Hennessy Funds office. After this year’s tremendous runup in mega-cap tech growth stocks, next year the market will probably see a shift to value and mid-cap stocks predicted Neil Hennessy, chairman and chief market strategist of Hennessy Funds, at the company’s recent market outlook press conference. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, with a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27, and the S&P 500 Index’s P/E at 24, are both distorted by tech stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA). The year-to-date returns of the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite are 15.7%, 26%, and 31% respectively, as of Dec. 20, according to Morningstar. This rapid expansion is unsustainable and will create volatility in the indexes. “People are going to end up being very disappointed with the indexes or they're going to enjoy the roller coaster ride because it's going to be all over the place,” said Hennessy, who is also the chairman and chief executive of Hennessy Advisors (HNNA), the funds’ parent company. Based in Novato, CA, the firm has 17 funds with $4.8 billion in assets under management. He predicts 2025 will see the market shift from growth stocks to value investing and stock picking, especially in small- and mid-cap stocks. Mid-caps are companies with capitalizations between $1 billion and $10 billion. He likes mid-caps because they’re undervalued, at about 18x forward earnings, compared to companies with large-capitalizations. Mid-caps are also diversified, have multiple business lines, and are more nimble than large-caps. They also have strong performance potential with lower volatility compared to small-cap stocks. Over the long-term, mid-caps outperform large-caps, and could experience a surge as large-cap stocks face increased volatility, said Hennessy. For the broader economy, the firm forecasts inflation will remain under control, and interest rates will remain stagnant, neither helping nor hurting businesses or consumers. However, consumers are expected to be resilient, with consumer spending expected to stay robust despite projections of a slower holiday season. Other positive factors include low unemployment, strong job openings, as well as, healthy corporate profits and cash flows. The perennial market bull said that aside from AI and cryptocurrencies, there is not widespread euphoria in the market, and that investors need to focus on diversification and stock picking. Going forward, he thinks U.S. equities offer moderate risk for reward because of a positive outlook for earnings, and a lot of cash for stock buybacks and dividends. Overall, there is still a lot of cash on the sidelines. As of Oct. 31, S&P 500 companies held $7.1 trillion on their balance sheets, according to Bloomberg. Money market funds held $7.0 trillion and bank deposits are at record highs of $17.3 trillion, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Investment Company Institute (ICI), a fund company trade group. He sees sector rotation into more defensive sectors —consumer discretionary, industrials, and utilities) if the growth stocks slowdown. Financial stocks are also expected to do well on improving interest rates and a healthy banking system. Hennessy pointed to the stock-picking success of the firm’s Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (HFMDX) (up 30.8% last year and year-to-date returns of 36.3%, according to Morningstar,) as a way to capture returns without relying on the "Magnificent 7" tech stocks. The fund has outperformed the S&P 500 over 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year periods, according to Morningstar, and received the firm’s 1% ranking as of the end of the third quarter. The concentrated portfolio of just 30 stocks focuses on mid-cap stocks with a strategy of combining value investing, earnings momentum, and stock momentum. Consumer discretionary and industrials make up more than 50% of the fund. The fund has a lower valuation than the overall market with a price-to-sales ratio of 0.9 vs. the Russell Midcap Indexes’ 1.8 and a forward PE ratio of 12.6. It won the 2024 Refinitiv Lipper Fund Award for Best-in-Category performance for the 5-year period, beating 826 funds. It charges an expense ratio of 1.34%.

Title: Retail investors buy Novo dip after disappointing weight-loss drug data

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Bhanvi Satija (Reuters) - U.S. retail investor fund flows into Novo Nordisk (NVO) surged 32-fold on Friday, as the Danish drugmaker's weaker-than-expected obesity drug data offered a rare dip-buying opportunity, according to Vanda Research. Daily net flows climbed to $15.6 million from $0.49 million a day earlier, after eagerly anticipated data showed Novo's experimental drug, CagriSema, helped patients cut 22.7% of their weight—short of the anticipated 25%. Novo competes with U.S. rival Eli Lilly (LLY) in the burgeoning market for weight-loss treatments, which is projected to exceed $150 billion in revenue within the next decade. "Retail investors love to buy dips, especially in popular stocks..and do so, until that doesn't work anymore," said Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda (VNDA). Shares of Novo Nordisk dropped 27% on Friday, erasing over $100 billion in market value. Its U.S.-listed shares tumbled 21% to $81.50, their lowest level since August 2023. "Right now Novo only dipped below S&P 500 performance for the first time in 2 years so, probably too early to see them (retail investors) give up on their buy-the dip-bias," he said. The retail flows on Friday likely provided an exit for institutional investors. Funds from retail investors touched a one-day high of $23.5 million on March 7, data from Vanda shows, after Novo's amycretin drug helped obese patients cut 13% of their weight in a study. The success of Novo’s Wegovy and Lilly’s Zepbound weight-loss drugs has revived retail interest in the healthcare sector. "With their GLP-1 product in the market and Eli Lilly being a lot on the news...a lot of retail investors know about Lilly," said Sel Hardy, vice president of equity research at CFRA. She suggested that a sell-off, like Lilly's stock dip in October, and mid-November, could provide “an attractive entry point” for retail investors Net retail flows into Lilly have outpaced Novo in the second half of 2024, according to Vanda. For Lilly, net retail purchases peaked in August after its weight-loss drug sales surpassed $1 billion for the quarter, prompting a $3 billion forecast increase. However, retail activity in these stocks lags behind tech giants such as Nvidia and Tesla, where activity often reaches the high teens.

Title: Is This Nancy Pelosi's Stock Pick Set To Overtake Nvidia? AI Chip Race To Heat Up By 2025

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Fund manager Stephen Yiu of Blue Whale Growth Fund has forecasted that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) will yield substantial returns for investors by 2025, potentially surpassing AI chip heavyweight Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). What Happened: Yiu said that tech giants like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google LLC (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are looking to broaden their AI chip supplier base. Despite their substantial purchases of Nvidia’s GPUs, these companies are now also creating their own custom chips for AI applications, CNBC reported on Monday. Don’t Miss: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast — here’s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate. Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Yiu sees Broadcom as the next Nvidia in terms of potential outperformance, thanks to its strong partnerships with major tech firms. “Nvidia's GPUs are very powerful, but at the same time also very expensive,” Yiu noted. “From Microsoft's perspective, you don't want to become overly dependent on one single supplier.” Broadcom’s year to date returns have climbed 103.42% this year, as of Monday pre-market hours, according to Benzinga Pro. It hit a market cap of over $1 trillion after announcing that its AI revenue tripled to $12.2 billion in 2024. The company is working with three major cloud computing customers, Meta, Alphabet, and ByteDance, to develop custom AI chips. Despite still holding an investment in Nvidia, Yiu has significantly cut it from nearly 10% of his fund's portfolio. He views Broadcom as a more attractive investment opportunity due to its smaller size. “For a $1 trillion company to grow 50% to become $1.5 trillion is reasonable. But for Nvidia to do that, they would need to add another $1.5 trillion, which is a very big number,” he elaborated. Trending: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. Why It Matters: Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan has expressed strong confidence in the sustainability of the AI boom. Big tech companies like Google, Meta, and ByteDance are investing heavily in designing custom processors to accelerate the training and deployment of AI systems. Even OpenAI and Apple have partnered with Broadcom to develop their AI server chips, diversifying their exposure to Nvidia. Kurv Investment Management’s CEO Howard Chan recently mentioned that chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom are leading the AI wave. He noted that demand is outstripping supply in this sector, benefiting chipmakers and cloud computing service providers. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), known for her active stock market investments as a member of Congress, disclosed in June that she had acquired call options on Broadcom. These options, adjusted to a strike price of $80 after a 10-for-1 stock split, are set to expire in June 2025. Pelosi, a widely followed Congressional trader, has drawn significant attention to her stock holdings, inspiring dedicated Pelosi portfolio trackers. Check It Out: EquityMultiple's ‘Alpine Note — Basecamp Series' is turning heads and opening wallets. This short-term note investment offers investors a 9% rate of return (APY) with just a 3 month term and $5K minimum. The Basecamp rate is at a significant spread to t-bills. This healthy rate of return won't last long. With the Fed poised to cut interest rates in the near future, now could be the time to lock in a favorable rate of return with a flexible, relatively liquid investment option. What's more, Alpine Note — Basecamp can be rolled into another Alpine Note for compounding returns, or into another of EquityMultiple's rigorously vetted real estate investments, which also carry a minimum investment of just $5K. Basecamp is exclusively open to new investors on the EquityMultiple platform. Looking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

Title: Nvidia dominated 2024 big-time. Next year? Plenty of challenges.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) has had the kind of year most companies can only dream of. Its revenue and stock price soared thanks to prescient investments in artificial intelligence technologies that are paying off handsomely on the back of the generative AI wave. That’s not all. It’s repeatedly swapped places with Apple (AAPL) as the largest publicly traded company in the world by market cap, topping the $3 trillion mark. CEO Jensen Huang has become one of the most in-demand executives in Silicon Valley, meeting with everyone from fellow tech luminaries to world leaders and then some. And there’s more to come. The company is ramping up production of its high-powered Blackwell chip for AI applications and expects to ship several billion dollars worth of the hardware in the fourth quarter alone, with far more expected throughout the year ahead. “Nvidia really has the [hardware and software] for the AI computing era,” Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance. “It's all connected inside the [server] rack, outside the [server] rack, and then the software is very well … liked within the developer communities.” But the competition isn’t sitting idly by. Companies like AMD (AMD) are angling to poach Nvidia’s customers and slice into its estimated 80% to 90% market share. Even Nvidia’s own customers are working on chips meant to cut down on their reliance on the graphics giant’s semiconductors. And Wall Street is getting on board. Nvidia stock was down 1% before the bell on Thursday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), which works with companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to design AI chips, are up 113% year to date and rocketed 44% in just the last month after CEO Hock Tan said AI could represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity for the company in 2027 alone. Still, taking on Nvidia will be a tough task for any company. And dethroning it as the AI king, at least in 2025, will be all but impossible. Nvidia grabbed a first-mover advantage in the AI market on the back of early investments in AI software that unlocked its graphics chips to be used as high-powered processors. And it’s managed to hold onto that lead in the space thanks to continued advances in its hardware, as well as its Cuda software that allows developers to build apps for its chips. Because of that, so-called hyperscalers, massive cloud computing providers including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet’s Google, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others continue to plow cash into buying up as many Nvidia chips as possible. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported total revenue of $35.1 billion. Of that, $30.8 billion, or 87% came from its data center business. “Everybody wants to build and train these huge models, and the most efficient way to do it is with CUDA software and Nvidia hardware,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. Nvidia is expected to continue to power the bulk of the AI industry in 2025 as well. The company’s Blackwell chip, the successor to its popular Hopper line of processors needed to power AI applications, is in production — and its customers, like Amazon, are already adding new cooling capabilities to their data centers to handle the immense heat the processors generate. “I don't know what the current backlog [for Nvidia’s chips is], but if it's not a year, it's close to a year,” O’Donnell said. “So, they're pretty much sold out for most of everything they're probably going to make next year already.” With hyperscalers calling for increased or at least the same level of capital expenditures in 2025 as in 2024, you can expect a chunk of that will end up going to the purchase of Blackwell chips. While Nvidia will retain control of the AI crown, there’s no shortage of challengers looking to take its throne. AMD and Intel (INTC) are the top contenders among chipmakers, and both have products on the market. AMD’s MI300X line of chips is designed to tackle Nvidia’s H100 Hopper chips, while Intel has its Gaudi 3 processor. AMD is better positioned to steal market share from Nvidia, though, as Intel continues to struggle amid its turnaround efforts and hunt for a new CEO. But even AMD is having a difficult time cracking Nvidia’s lead. “What AMD needs to do is make software really usable, build the systems where there's more demand …with developers, and ultimately, that could create more sell through,” Newman said. “Because these cloud providers are going to sell what their customers ask for.” It’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Nvidia’s customers are increasingly developing and pushing their own AI chips. Google has its Broadcom-based tensor processing unit chips (TPUs), while Amazon (AMZN) has its Trainium 2 processor and Microsoft (MSFT) has its Maia 100 accelerator. There’s also concern that the shift to "inferencing AI models" will reduce the need for high-powered Nvidia chips. Tech companies develop AI models by training them on huge amounts of data, otherwise referred to as the training process. Training requires incredibly powerful chips and lots of energy. Inferencing, or actually putting those AI models to work, is less resource- and power-intensive. As inferencing becomes a larger part of AI workloads, the thinking goes, companies will back away from needing to purchase so many Nvidia chips. Huang has said he is prepared for this, explaining at various events that Nvidia’s chips are just as good at inferencing as they are at training. Even if Nvidia’s market share slides, it doesn’t necessarily mean its business will be doing any worse than before. “This is definitely a case of raising all boats,” Newman said. “So even with much stronger competition, which I think they certainly will have, that doesn't mean they're going to fail. This is people building a bigger pie.” Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) has had the kind of year most companies can only dream of. Its revenue and stock price soared thanks to prescient investments in artificial intelligence technologies that are paying off handsomely on the back of the generative AI wave. That’s not all. It’s repeatedly swapped places with Apple (AAPL) as the largest publicly traded company in the world by market cap, topping the $3 trillion mark. CEO Jensen Huang has become one of the most in-demand executives in Silicon Valley, meeting with everyone from fellow tech luminaries to world leaders and then some. And there’s more to come. The company is ramping up production of its high-powered Blackwell chip for AI applications and expects to ship several billion dollars worth of the hardware in the fourth quarter alone, with far more expected throughout the year ahead. “Nvidia really has the [hardware and software] for the AI computing era,” Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance. “It's all connected inside the [server] rack, outside the [server] rack, and then the software is very well … liked within the developer communities.” But the competition isn’t sitting idly by. Companies like AMD (AMD) are angling to poach Nvidia’s customers and slice into its estimated 80% to 90% market share. Even Nvidia’s own customers are working on chips meant to cut down on their reliance on the graphics giant’s semiconductors. And Wall Street is getting on board. Nvidia stock was down 1% before the bell on Thursday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), which works with companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to design AI chips, are up 113% year to date and rocketed 44% in just the last month after CEO Hock Tan said AI could represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity for the company in 2027 alone. Still, taking on Nvidia will be a tough task for any company. And dethroning it as the AI king, at least in 2025, will be all but impossible. Nvidia grabbed a first-mover advantage in the AI market on the back of early investments in AI software that unlocked its graphics chips to be used as high-powered processors. And it’s managed to hold onto that lead in the space thanks to continued advances in its hardware, as well as its Cuda software that allows developers to build apps for its chips. Because of that, so-called hyperscalers, massive cloud computing providers including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet’s Google, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others continue to plow cash into buying up as many Nvidia chips as possible. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported total revenue of $35.1 billion. Of that, $30.8 billion, or 87% came from its data center business. “Everybody wants to build and train these huge models, and the most efficient way to do it is with CUDA software and Nvidia hardware,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. Nvidia is expected to continue to power the bulk of the AI industry in 2025 as well. The company’s Blackwell chip, the successor to its popular Hopper line of processors needed to power AI applications, is in production — and its customers, like Amazon, are already adding new cooling capabilities to their data centers to handle the immense heat the processors generate. “I don't know what the current backlog [for Nvidia’s chips is], but if it's not a year, it's close to a year,” O’Donnell said. “So, they're pretty much sold out for most of everything they're probably going to make next year already.” With hyperscalers calling for increased or at least the same level of capital expenditures in 2025 as in 2024, you can expect a chunk of that will end up going to the purchase of Blackwell chips. While Nvidia will retain control of the AI crown, there’s no shortage of challengers looking to take its throne. AMD and Intel (INTC) are the top contenders among chipmakers, and both have products on the market. AMD’s MI300X line of chips is designed to tackle Nvidia’s H100 Hopper chips, while Intel has its Gaudi 3 processor. AMD is better positioned to steal market share from Nvidia, though, as Intel continues to struggle amid its turnaround efforts and hunt for a new CEO. But even AMD is having a difficult time cracking Nvidia’s lead. “What AMD needs to do is make software really usable, build the systems where there's more demand …with developers, and ultimately, that could create more sell through,” Newman said. “Because these cloud providers are going to sell what their customers ask for.” It’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Nvidia’s customers are increasingly developing and pushing their own AI chips. Google has its Broadcom-based tensor processing unit chips (TPUs), while Amazon (AMZN) has its Trainium 2 processor and Microsoft (MSFT) has its Maia 100 accelerator. There’s also concern that the shift to "inferencing AI models" will reduce the need for high-powered Nvidia chips. Tech companies develop AI models by training them on huge amounts of data, otherwise referred to as the training process. Training requires incredibly powerful chips and lots of energy. Inferencing, or actually putting those AI models to work, is less resource- and power-intensive. As inferencing becomes a larger part of AI workloads, the thinking goes, companies will back away from needing to purchase so many Nvidia chips. Huang has said he is prepared for this, explaining at various events that Nvidia’s chips are just as good at inferencing as they are at training.

Title: What's New With American Express Stock?

Time Published: 2024-12-24T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
05 July 2022, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rottweil: An American Express Gold Card is lying in an office. ... [+] Photo: Silas Stein/dpa (Photo by Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images) American Express (NYSE: AXP) stock remains up by about 55% over the past year, considerably outperforming the S&P 500 which remains up by about 23% this year. In comparison, peer Capital One (NYSE: COF) is up 33% year-to-date, while Visa and Mastercard stocks are up by about 22% and 23% respectively. So what are some of the trends that have driven American Express stock higher of late? American Express has posted strong financial results, beating earnings estimates over the first three quarters of this year. For Q3 2024, American Express’ revenue was up by about 8% year-over-year to $16.6 billion, while adjusted earnings came in at $3.49 per share, up about 6% compared to last year. American Express has a large base of affluent card members compared to its key rivals and these customers have continued to spend strongly, helping the company’s business. Billings, a metric representing cardholder spending, was up by about 6% from a year ago. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. The company’s fee revenue grew by a robust 18%. The average fees per card - which includes transaction fees, subscription fees, as well as commissions - increased 13% year over year in Q3. Amex’s customer cohort is attractive to merchants given their higher spending power. This means that Amex charges merchants higher discount rates than Visa and Mastercard (about 3%). The company also added about 3.3 million new card acquisitions and this is also helping to drive up subscription fee-related revenues. Amex also has multiple partnerships including Marriott International and Delta, enabling customers to earn attractive rewards and further incentivizing spending activity. Admirably, AXP stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 4 years Returns for the stock were 37% in 2021, -9% in 2022, and 29% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk than the benchmark index, making the ride less of a roller-coaster, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, what lies ahead for Amex? The company’s full-year revenue guidance was a bit softer than expected, projecting that revenue growth would come in at the low end of its previous guidance of 9% and 11% for the year. However, the company raised its EPS guidance for the fiscal year to $13.75 to $14.05 per share, up from $13.30 to $13.80 previously. There are a couple of trends that could drive AXP stock going forward. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times since September, and lower rates could likely drive consumer spending to an extent benefiting AXP’s transaction volumes and fee revenues. The strong rebound in travel-related spending is also likely to help the company given that it specializes in premium travel credit cards. The company has been expanding quickly among Gen Z and millennial customers, with its total rate of card additions coming in at about 3 million each quarter in recent quarters. Although this segment is unlikely to meaningfully drive card spending growth in the medium term, younger customers could emerge as high-value clients in the long run. The election of Donald Trump to the U.S. Presidency could signal an easier regulatory environment for financial players such as American Express and this could also help the company to an extent. We value AXP stock at about $255 per share, which is slightly below the current market price. See our American Express valuation for more details.

Title: Apple Nears $4 Trillion Valuation, Surges Past Nvidia, Microsoft. Here's Why
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/apple-nears-4-trillion-valuation-surges-past-nvidia-microsoft-heres-why-7321364
Time Published: 2024-12-24T09:25:23Z
Full Content:
Apple is closing in on a historic $4 trillion stock market valuation, powered by investors cheering progress in the company's long-awaited AI enhancements to rejuvenate sluggish iPhone sales. The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16% jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalization. The latest rally in Apple shares reflects "investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades," said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a "hold" rating. Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones. In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology. Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800% over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period. Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite. The company expects overall revenue to increase "low- to mid-single digits" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series. However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025. "Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand," Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's "top pick" heading into 2025. The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations. "I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today," said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares. Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10% on goods coming from China. "We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018," Woodring said. Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year. "Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Fed's action "could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology." "Apple's approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Ford Motor (F) Is in Trouble – Here’s Why

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls Before 2025 Begins: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) stands against other stocks in Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut and its guidance that suggested fewer rate cuts moving ahead. “I guess you could say the baby got thrown out with the bathwater. It was truly hideous, a little unexpected, and yes, wicked. Even though the market’s barely oversold, we may not get that quick snapback we normally expect in a deeply oversold market,” Cramer said. Jim Cramer said Jerome Powell’s comments and tone were “stern” and his conference call “confounded” investors. Cramer said inflation has not come down enough and that has made the Fed’s job difficult. Cramer then talked about different sectors and companies that need rate cuts amid a slowdown. “I really wish the Fed hadn’t been so defensive about the need to cut rates going forward. A slower approach would have been much better. If they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting, we’d be in a better position. This time, they telegraphed the wrong thing, hence today’s meltdown. However, if the weaker part of the economy deteriorates further or inflation comes down, the Fed still has room to cut. Here’s the bottom line: a previously data-dependent Fed chose not to be data-dependent today with its pronouncements, and that’s what drove the market down. This happened despite the quarter-point rate cut—something that’s typically good news for stocks—but it turned out to be the very opposite.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he is talking about. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A Ford truck roaring down a highway, with powerful headlights blazing its way. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 36 Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC expressed his concerns over rising warranty costs of Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and said the stock does not have a lot of “MOJO.” “Ford does not have a lot of mojo in this note by Jefferies. This is one of the reasons—what can save the Fed when they cut. Ford has an inventory drifting up to 96 days. That says to me price cut, way too much, way too much. And by the way, that’s far more than GM—26. Wow. I mean, GM and Stellantis have much lower inventories.” Ford shares have gained about 10% over the past 10 years, a stark contrast to the S&P 500’s 250%. Legacy automakers like Ford are grappling with challenges from newer competitors, the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), and the rapid rise of autonomous technology. Ford’s Model e segment continues to drain cash as Ford works to strengthen its EV business. While the company has some strong products, it faces stiff competition from Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN), and other EV makers, leading to significant losses. Year-to-date, Ford’s EBIT has dropped to $8.1 billion, down from $9.4 billion in the same period last year. Ford’s struggle to reduce warranty costs remains a concern. The company issued 62 recalls in 2024, far surpassing General Motors Company (GM), which had 33. Since 2021, Ford has had the industry’s highest recall rate, reflecting poorly on management’s efforts to lower warranty expenses and damaging the brand’s reputation. Overall, F ranks 10th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins.

Title: Apple Approaches $4 Trillion Valuation as Investors Bet on AI Momentum

Photo Credit: Reuters Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs under President-elect Donald Trump Apple is closing in on a historic $4 trillion (roughly Rs. 3,40,73,552 crore) stock market valuation, powered by investors cheering progress in the company's long-awaited AI enhancements to rejuvenate sluggish iPhone sales. The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16 percent jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion (roughly Rs. 42,59,194 crore) to its market capitalisation. The latest rally in Apple shares reflects "investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades," said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a "hold" rating. Valued at about $3.85 trillion (roughly Rs. 3,27,95,962 crore) as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first US company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones. In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology. Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800 percent over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period. Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite. The company expects overall revenue to increase "low- to mid-single digits" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series. However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025. "Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand," Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's "top pick" heading into 2025. The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations. "I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today," said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares. Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if US President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10 percent on goods coming from China. "We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018," Woodring said. Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year. "Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Fed's action "could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology." "Apple's approach to $4 trillion (roughly Rs. 3,40,73,552 crore) market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments. © Thomson Reuters 2024 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Mega automobile mergerNissan and Honda have begun official merger discussions, the two companies announced on Monday. Negotiations will end June 2025. Japan-listed Honda shares were last up 13.4% on Tuesday and on track for their best day since October 2008, after the company announced plans to buy back 24% of its issued shares by Dec. 23 next year. Taiwan tops Asian marketsAs of Dec. 23, Taiwan's Taiex had gained 28.85%, making it the best-performing stock market in Asia-Pacific in 2024. The Taiex's focus on tech and tech-related stocks helped supercharge its performance. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company soared 82.12% in 2024, and Foxconn — which trades as Hon Hai Precision Industry — advanced 77.51%. Positive start to holidaysU.S. markets rose on Monday on the back of a strong showing by large tech stocks. The New York Stock Exchange closes early Tuesday for Christmas Eve. Asia-Pacific stocks traded mixed on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped roughly 0.4% even as Honda shares popped. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed more than 1%. UK GDP not OKThe U.K. economy failed to expand in the three months ending September, according to revised figure from the Office for National Statistics, published Monday. Previous estimates had pegged third-quarter gross domestic product at 0.1%. Earlier this month, data from the ONS showed the U.K. economy had unexpectedly contracted by 0.1% in October. [PRO] Buffett's biggest war chestWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is currently holding $325 billion in cash — the largest amount it's hoarded in absolute terms. Cash now comprises around 30% of Berkshire's total assets, the highest proportion in 34 years, according to data from Oppenheimer. Buffett sold large quantities of Apple and Bank of America shares this year. Why is the 94-year-old legendary investor holding on to so much cash? Analysts weigh in. U.S. markets began the trading week in holiday cheer. The S&P 500 gained 0.73% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recovering from earlier losses, ticked up 0.16%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.98% on the back of strong performances from large tech firms such as Nvidia, Tesla and Meta Platforms. However, shares of bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy slumped 8.8% on its first day in the Nasdaq-100 index, following the cryptocurrency's price falling to below $93,000 on Monday. That said, MicroStrategy is still among the best-performing U.S. tech companies valued at $5 billion or more, according to FactSet data. Its shares have rocketed 426% so far this year, mostly thanks to the company's stockpile of bitcoins, which it started to amass in 2020. With the rally in bitcoin following Donald Trump's election victory, MicroStrategy's bitcoin holding is now worth around $42 billion. It's the basis for the company's market capitalization ballooning to $82 billion from roughly $1.1 billion from the time it began buying bitcoin in bulk. Investors looking to ride on MicroStrategy's explosive rise should remember that the company's share price is currently trading on the back of bitcoin prices. The flipside of it is that if bitcoin prices crater for any reason — volatile as cryptocurrency can be — MicroStrategy shares may stumble too. Trading is likely to be thin this week. Markets in the U.S. will close early on Tuesday and take a break on Wednesday for Christmas Day. But light trading doesn't mean small moves in markets.

Title: Will Novo Nordisk (NVO) Stock Recover To $145 Levels?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/24/will-novo-nordisk-nvo-stock-recover-to-145-levels/

CEO Lars Fruergaard Joergensen delivers a statement during a presentation of the new production site ... [+] of Novo Nordisk "Site Odense" in Kroghs park in Odense, Denmark, on December 16, 2024. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) Novo Nordisk ADR (NYSE: NVO) currently trades at $89 per share, nearly 40% below its peak level of over $145 seen in June of this year. In contrast, its closest peer, Eli Lilly stock is down 15% over this period. NVO stock was trading around $55 in early June 2022, just before the U.S. Fed started increasing rates, and is now 60% above that level, compared to 45% gains for the S&P 500 during this period. This outperformance of NVO stock can be attributed to a ramp up in sales of its obesity drugs. Novo Nordisk is based out of Denmark. Notably, Denmark’s interest rates are lower than those in the U.S. As an aside, after dropping 20% the first half of the year, and then recovering, see Why Is Expedia Stock Up 24% This Year? NVO stock has struggled in the past few months. In fact, Novo was down over 20% on Friday, December 20, after the company reported underwhelming results from a late-stage clinical study for its obesity treatment – CagriSema. The trial showed that CagriSema helped patients reduce their weight by 22.7%, below the 25% Novo Nordisk was targeting. But, even before this fall, the stock was underperforming, with slower than anticipated sales growth for its obesity drugs. In fact, the company missed Q3 revenue and earnings estimates, weighing on its stock. While NVO stock has had a tough ride lately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. In this note, we capture trends in the company’s stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022. It compares these trends to the stock’s performance during the 2008 recession. Timeline of Inflation Shock So Far: In contrast, here’s how NVO stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis. NVO stock declined from nearly $5.40 in April 2008 (pre-crisis peak for the stock) to $3.20 in early March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying it lost 40% of its pre-crisis value. It recovered post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $5 in early 2010, rising about 56% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124. Novo Nordisk’s revenue rose over 2x from 127 billion DKK in 2020 to 271 billion DKK for the last twelve-month period. This can primarily be attributed to the success of its diabetes and obesity drugs – Wegovy and Ozempic. While Ozempic’s sales have risen 4.5x from $21.2 billion DKK in 2020 to 95.7 billion DKK in 2023, Wegovy’s sales have surged to $31.3 billion in 2023, since its launch in 2021. The company’s operating margin has also expanded from 42.6% to 43.7% over the same period. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of 21.20 DKK per share for the last twelve month period, versus 9.01 DKK per share in 2020. Novo Nordisk’s total debt increased from 10 billion DKK in 2020 to 57 billion DKK now, while its cash increased from around 13 billion DKK to 75 billion DKK over the same period. The company also garnered 118 billion DKK in cash flows from operations in the last twelve months. Novo Nordisk is a net debt positive company, and it has a sufficient cash cushion to meet its near-term obligations. While the Fed’s efforts to tame runaway inflation rates has helped market sentiments in the past, its recent hawkish outlook for 2025 is now worrying investors. We believe Novo Nordisk stock has the potential for some gains once markets finds a footing, digesting the news of fewer than anticipated rate cuts next year. Although the development around CagriSema doesn’t bode well for NVO stock, we think after a meaningful 40% correction from its recent highs, the headwinds appear to be priced in. Notably, the $123 average of analysts price estimates reflects a solid 45% upside potential from here. Admirably, NVO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last three years. Returns for the stock were 63% in 2021, 23% in 2022, and 55% in 2023. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While NVO stock looks like it has some room for growth, it is helpful to see how some of its peers, such as Eli Lilly, fare on metrics that matter.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed higher Tuesday in thin trading ahead of the Christmas holiday, as tech stocks continued their strong start to the week. At 1:00 p.m. ET (18:00 GMT), both S&P 500 rose 1.1%, the Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%, or 350 points. The New York Stock Exchange is set to close early Tuesday for Christmas Eve, and the market is shut on Christmas Day. Tech added to its strong start to the week as the so-called Mag 7 including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) climbed, though NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) traded flat. Chip stocks, which racked up stocks gains a day earlier, were marginally higher Biden after the Biden administration launched a new trade investigation into Chinese-made legacy chips, which could elad to fresh tariffs on Chinese semiconductors. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) shares were flat recovering intraday loss Tuesday as the airline briefly grounded all flights in the U.S. due to a "technical issue." The ground stop was later lifted. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) slipped, halting its recovery from a recent plunge that was triggered by results from a late-stage study of its weight loss drug that fell of expectations. BofA Securities stated its clients continued to buy US equities for the seventh straight week. Specifically, inflows reached $10 billion – the second-largest amount since 2008 and the biggest since January 2017. Similar to recent weeks, purchases were spread across both individual stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with stronger inflows directed toward single stocks. Large-cap stocks saw the bulk of the buying activity, while small caps experienced more subdued inflows. Institutional and retail investors increased their equity holdings for another week – the third for institutions and the second for retail clients. In contrast, hedge funds were net sellers for the second consecutive week. The rolling four-week average of inflows from institutional clients hit its highest point in nine months, reflecting a typical pattern of renewed buying activity following October’s tax-loss selling by mutual funds. “Private clients typically are big sellers in December amid tax loss selling vs. big net buyers in January. While this group has been a buyer of ETFs this month, it has sold single stocks, though slightly less so than in the average December,” BofA strategists led by Jill Carey Hall noted.
