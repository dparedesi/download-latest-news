A federal judge in Texas largely denied a request by the world’s largest asset managers to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general claiming they colluded to reduce coal output, in a case that threatens how the U.S. firms oversee trillions of dollars. U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Texas said most of the claims brought by the states can proceed, including allegations that BlackRock Inc., BlackRock Group Inc. and the asset management arm of State Street Corp. collectively used their stock to attempt to substantially lessen competition. Kernodle dismissed part of the lawsuit that was based on alleged violations of state law. In his Friday ruling, Kernodle said the states “have identified enough circumstantial evidence to suggest that defendants agreed to collectively pressure coal companies to reduce the output of coal in the relevant markets and disclose future output information.” Representatives for the firms didn’t immediately return requests for comment on the ruling. In their lawsuit, Texas and other Republican-led states claimed the asset managers colluded to pressure coal producers to reduce their production under the guise of pursuing environmental goals. The states cite the firms’ participation in carbon-reduction alliances as evidence of a “syndicate.” BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard hold major stakes in coal producers and profited when energy prices soared, according to the suit. More recently, the firms have pulled back from ESG in the U.S. and participation in groups such as Climate Action 100+ and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Texas even removed BlackRock from its blacklist of companies that boycott fossil fuels. But the lawsuit, filed in November, said that formal withdrawal from Climate 100+ “does not change the reality that defendants’ holdings threaten to substantially reduce competition in violation” of U.S. antitrust law. Lawyers for the three firms argued at a hearing in June that the firms did nothing to influence coal companies. “The antitrust claims in this case are unprecedented, they’re unsound and they’re unsupported,” said Gregg Costa, a lawyer representing BlackRock. “The claims just don’t add up.” Topics Lawsuits Texas Legislation

Title: How Jamie Dimon becomes Sam Altman’s biggest competitor

UPDATED 16:13 EDT / AUGUST 03 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and George Gilbert Last November, we argued that JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is sitting on a treasure trove of unique data that will never find its way into proprietary large language models via the internet. And as such, he was OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s biggest competitor because his data is more valuable than the democratized insights from these LLMs. Our premise was and continues to be that foundation model companies are waging an internecine battle chasing artificial general intelligence (“Messiah AGI”) and the true holy grail is what we called “enterprise AGI” — meaning applying AI to proprietary data inside of enterprises will ultimately prove to be the most valuable economic endeavor. Today we extend that argument and posit that agents and enterprise digital twins, powered by that proprietary data, will drive the next wave of AI value. In our previous “Jamie Dimon” episode, we set a framework for the why. In this Breaking Analysis, we explain how enterprises such as JPMC will drive value in a way that frontier model vendors cannot. We’ll examine our original premise and share data that further reinforces the challenges foundation model vendors face, making it a daunting business. Moreover, we’ll explain why agents, programmed by data, will ultimately provide the biggest value unlock for enterprises in the coming years. We think of agent evolution in three distinct waves as shown below: Consumer agents – ChatGPT in its GPT-3/4 era gave us the first taste of a personal digital assistant. GPT-5 will likely deliver the first general-purpose, consumer-grade agent that can act on a user’s behalf, not just chat. Coding agents – Anthropic’s Claude paired with Cursor shows what happens when you post-train with reinforcement learning onto a strong base model and aim it at software engineering. Code is a good proving ground because outcomes are objectively testable, much like math problems. Enterprise agents – We believe this is the next frontier – i.e. agents powered by a live digital twin of the business. Not digital twins of something physical such as a factory like Nvidia Corp.’s Omniverse, rather an enterprise. Here the landscape changes. It’s not just about bigger models; it’s new vendor tech stacks, new vendor business models, and new customer operating models that we’ll explain. The value is so large that even Jamie Dimon, with his huge balance sheet and orders of magnitude more useful data than frontier labs have access to, is stepping onto Sam Altman’s playing field. With that framing in place, let’s walk through why the jump from consumer/coder agents to enterprise agents is not a linear extrapolation, and what new technology and organizational layers have to materialize before Jamie Dimon can realistically challenge OpenAI’s lead. We make the following additional points on this topic: Dimon, as we’ve talked about before, is a proxy for enterprises and the proprietary data and know-how that they have within their four walls that frontier LLMs cannot train on. This is why the real value will come from enterprises applying that data and know-how to extending the frontier LLMs or models that are similar to that and we’ll explain why. The real revolution is that we’ve moved from scaling laws in the pre-training era—which is the GPT models that ChatGPT and similar products were built on, to the post-training era, which is where we start using reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a fancy term for trial-and-error learning and, for trial-and-error, you have to be able to learn from your mistakes. So that’s where agents in the enterprise first take off. And then our contention is that to go beyond that is where we’re going to need a new type of technology platform — the enterprise digital twin. To get real value out of that, we’re going to have to go with a new—not just new technology model at the foundation where the data is — but a new operations model where firms have to organize around end-to-end outcomes like onboarding a new customer, not departmental or functional specialization. As such, we’re going to need lots of changes. And the main point is that Jamie Dimon (as a proxy for leading enterprises) and the value he’s going to extract from this era of AI is going to need completely different scaffolding and sets of business models for customers like him, as well as the vendors that supply him, compared to the era where ChatGPT is creating and capturing value today. In short, we believe this shift — from pre-training scale to post-training skill, and from siloed workflows to outcome-centric twins — sets the competitive chessboard for the next decade of enterprise AI. Let’s drill into the first wave a bit deeper ChatGPT on GPT3.5 got it all started. but GPT-5 is where we think ChatGPT’s real value as a general-purpose consumer agent begins. OpenAI’s own revenue projection (dotted red line below) climbs from low-single billions in 2024 to >$50 billion by 2027 — a growth curve that many people feel threatens Google Search – we’ll see. The red call-outs above are instructive as there are caveats, technical rewirings and business model changes that have to fall into place before GPT-5-class agents can move from cool demo to must-have personal assistant. Specifically: Thirty years ago investors hailed the commercial internet as the greatest legal creation of wealth in history. Today we hear equally grand pronouncements that generative AI surpasses fire, the wheel and electricity. GPT-5 will likely justify a good share of that hyperbole. By unifying multimodal reasoning — voice, video, tool use, research, code execution — OpenAI is poised to ship the first truly full-stack consumer agent, a blockbuster product by any historical yardstick. But the leap from headline to habit requires upheaval on multiple fronts: The headline is that GPT-5 can ignite massive consumer adoption, yet widespread value capture hinges on re-plumbing the web and re-monetizing content. That’s before we even tackle the additional hurdles unique to enterprise deployment, which carry their own technology, governance and operating-model demands. Before we get too excited about GPT-5, let’s stare at the brutal economics of scale. The data below tells a big story. Upper-right chart: That “scaling-law” line (log of compute petaflops for pretraining on the X-axis, log of test-loss, which is a fancy way of describing accuracy and the ability to recognize ever finer patterns, on the Y-axis) moves steadily down — but every inch of improvement demands an order-of-magnitude jump in PF-days (petaflop-days) of compute. Let’s unpack where the above numbers come from. On the slide above, the left axis shows estimated training cost per generation; the right axis plots the corresponding test-loss improvement. The $35 million mark for a GPT-3-class model is the common reference point. Each successive generation requires roughly a 10-times to to 30-times increase in training FLOPs, but after algorithmic and hardware efficiencies the all-in cash outlay still grows about five to 10 times each cycle. Numbers often look smaller because they capture only the final two- or three-month production run. That explains the confusion around DeepSeek’s reported $6 million cost; the figure omitted the research runs, data-ablation experiments and restarts that consume three to 10 times more compute before the last pass even begins. The slide’s curve makes a second point clear. Each jump in spend buys only an incremental drop in test loss — better predictive accuracy, more reliable answers, finer pattern detection. Keeping pace on pretraining alone is already pushing costs toward $10 billion for a single next-gen run. At that level the market cannot sustain many players unless they add a strongly differentiated layer on top of the base model. Coming bottlenecks in high-quality training data and intense competition will squeeze both the magnitude and the lifespan of any price premium on raw application programming interface access. Reinforcement-learning can address the law of diminishing returns by opening up a new scaling vector. And inference-time “reasoning” opens up yet another dimension of scaling. But the pretraining foundation still needs to keep advancing. This means the capital intensity of playing at the frontier model layer continues to increase exponentially. The economics of amortizing pretraining works as long as the end market continues to grow at a similar pace. But when the market growth slows, the cost of pretraining is going to look like a game of musical chairs when the music stops. So far we’ve focused on compute costs, but there’s an equally brutal constraint we need to discuss, which is that we’re running out of free, high-quality human text. The chart above tracks the “effective stock” of usable internet tokens (green band) versus the projected size of datasets consumed by frontier models (blue band). Those two curves meet around 2027-28 — meaning every extra point of model improvement will require new strategies. We should point out though that synthetic data is easy to generate with computer code because you can test it and therefore, the synthetic data now has more signal in it. Does it work? Does it not work? And you have all sorts of tests and that’s why as we’ll see, coding agents take off first. But the first way of trying to get past this data wall as we’re going to show is to use human-generated reasoning traces, which is when you get essentially a wide range of experts in different fields to try and elaborate on their problem-solving strategies to get to a solution for how to solve problems in specific domains, and that’s super expensive. As such: Model vendors will see their cost of goods sold for training data rise significantly. Depending on the posture of public policy, they may have to pay to license proprietary publisher data. Those deals are already starting as we saw with the recent Amazon/NYT deal. Whether this is the first of many or a high-water mark remains to be seen. More important, model vendors will have to source ever more sophisticated problem sets and “reasoning traces” from human experts in ever more fields. That’s what data vendors such as Scale.ai specialize in sourcing. Alex Wang of Scale AI says the next breakthroughs hinge on human-annotated chains of thought — not just more scraped text prose. Annotation at that depth is expensive and slow. It’s the next bottleneck. That type of data scarcity reshapes the economics of pretraining frontier models. And it’s why Meta reportedly shelled out ~$15 billion for a 50% stake in Scale.ai’s network of experts. [Listen to Alex Wang explain this phenomenon] A key point made by Wang is: “Data production will be the lifeblood of future AI systems” and he emphasized the human element – and this is why Meta paid $15 billion to acquire Alex. Some additional context to Alex Wang’s comments: Data production is very similar to spice production; it will be the lifeblood of future AI systems. The best-and-brightest people are one key source of that lifeblood, but proprietary data is just as critical. JPMorgan alone holds hundreds of petabytes of data, while GPT-4 trained on less than one petabyte. Enterprises and governments own orders of magnitude more proprietary data than has ever been fed into a frontier model, and that reservoir can power the next wave of truly elite systems. The open question is the role of synthetic data. The most plausible path is hybrid human-AI generation: AI handles the bulk creation, while domain experts — people with deep reasoning skills — inject high-fidelity corrections and insights. Hybrid human-AI data is the only way to achieve the extreme quality and nuance that future models will require. Meta’s reported $15 billion deal for Scale AI underscores this reality. The acquisition was less about tooling and more about access to Alex Wang, a small cadre of specialists, and Scale’s network of expert labelers across multiple domains. Human expert reasoning traces have emerged as the new bottleneck for frontier labs. In effect, these firms are calling for patriotic data contributions so everyone else can benefit, because without those human-validated traces, large language models will stall at their current ceiling. The funny part of Alex Wang’s comment was that he was basically calling on experts in every field to “contribute” their expertise for the benefit of mankind. Scale pays these experts for their time, but it’s still hourly wage labor. The tongue-in-cheek headline, “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,” was at the heart of Karl Marx’s economic philosophy. If you squint hard enough, that sounds an awful lot like what Alex Wang is proposing: Subject-matter experts contribute their knowledge for model training for the benefit of mankind. After the $15 billion acquihire, Alex Wang could be history’s richest communist. In the enterprise, there’s a very concrete use case that is already taking off and gives every indication of supporting frontier model training on its own. Why is coding is such a popular use case? And why are software engineering agents the first killer application in the enterprise? Let’s dig in. The face at the top on the graphic below is Anthropic PBC CEO Dario Amodei, whose Claude model powers Cursor the product — the software engineering agent. And Cursor is just the leading example of many software engineering agents. We’re still on the same intelligence-over-time curve, after the ChatGPT consumer bump, we see a new step-function labeled “Claude + Cursor SWE Agents.” The revenue table on the left — $1 million at launch, $100 million by month 12, $300 million by month 24, $500 million by month 30 — illustrates just how fast the uptake has been. What makes coding uniquely suited for early enterprise-agent success, and what hurdles remain before we can generalize this model to finance, supply-chain or customer-service domains where the feedback signals aren’t as clear? The answer is provided in the commentary below: Trial-and-error learning – reinforcement learning in formal terms – explains the breakout success of software-engineering agents. Unlike foundation models that consume 15 trillion tokens of data, a coding agent generates its own data. It proposes a solution, runs a test and immediately learns from pass-or-fail feedback. This loop supplies endless synthetic data and intrinsic reward signals, eliminating the need for vast proprietary datasets. Just as important, the workflow drops neatly into established developer tooling, so adoption requires no organizational surgery. These conditions made software engineering the natural beachhead for AI agents. Cursor is the iconic reference point, but dozens of similar tools are scaling fast, nearly all gravitating to Anthropic’s Claude frontier model as the preferred engine. Most products focus on writing net-new code or translating between languages; wholesale refactoring of legacy codebases is a harder problem and remains largely untapped. Success in software and math does not automatically port to other enterprise domains, where equivalent, high-fidelity feedback loops are harder to construct – a challenge we explore in subsequent slides. Let’s dig deeper into why SWE and math are such good examples. The chart below tracks accuracy on a basket of “intelligence” benchmarks – grade-school math, competitive math, software engineering task suite, multi-subject exams — over the past five years. Y-axis is benchmark accuracy; X-axis is calendar year. Everything meanders upward until sometime in 2024, then the red box shows a near-vertical surge. What changed? Post-training reinforcement learning on top of an already-strong base model. During the pretraining era – essentially up through mid-2024 – data efficiency was modest, reliant on scraping the vast but finite reservoirs of freely available Internet text. Once those wells began to run dry, progress hit diminishing returns. The inflection arrived in late 2024, when the post-training era took hold. Trial-and-error learning, i.e., reinforcement learning, allowed models to generate candidate outputs, verify them autonomously, and update weights based on right-or-wrong signals. Benchmarks in math and coding responded almost immediately, climbing at a near-vertical rate. The mechanism is straightforward: An agent checks its own work; if the test passes, the gradient reinforces that solution. If it fails, the model adjusts. That loop delivers dramatic gains without requiring trillions of new tokens. Both domains offer an immediate, unambiguous reward signal – code compiles or it doesn’t or it passes a unit test or it doesn’t; the math is either right or wrong – so the agent can as an objective verification tool, retry and learn. That tight loop means you don’t need another 10 trillion tokens of pretraining data; you just need a verifiable reward. But the catch is called out on the right of the graphic. The recipe doesn’t yet generalize to, say, legal reasoning or financial forecasting, where the ground truth is fuzzy, delayed or buried in human judgment. Generalizing the technique remains an open challenge. Two paths are emerging: The critical takeaway is once a domain provides an automated verifier, post-training efficiency explodes. The race is now to identify or construct verifiable environments beyond software and mathematics. There may be a new way of generating synthetic data that gets us past both the data bottleneck and the challenge of objectively verifiable rewards – something that appeared not long after Wang cashed his check. It has to do with trial-and-error learning (the fancy term is reinforcement learning) and models that can verify subjective, not objective, answers without humans in the loop. In other words, we may have a way of getting past human expert annotators detailing their reasoning to get to a correct answer. It appears GPT5, or an upgrade that comes soon after, will try to generate some combination of expert questions, answers, and the reasoning traces to get to the answers. Another model, acting like a teacher or verifier, will grade the right answers and the reasoning traces. This way the models might be able to get on a steep learning curve for more subjective answers just the way they’ve been learning math and coding. With verifiable rewards, SWE agents have been improving much faster than the general purpose underlying models. Once you inject reinforcement learning into a reliable reward signal, progress goes exponential. On the chart below, the Y-axis plots “task length” (think: wall-clock work a human would need). The gentle green slope (seven-month cadence) is overshadowed by the blue trend line on the right – halving the time horizon every 70 days. Left chart (METR data). Across general agent benchmarks the length of tasks an AI can complete without human hand-holding doubles roughly every seven months. GPT-2 could answer a trivia question; GPT-4o can spend ~15 minutes autonomously optimizing code for a custom chip. The slide isolates the core issue in agent self-improvement. For broad, loosely verified tasks the only boost comes from generic gains in the base model and occasional evaluation cycles – yielding a doubling of autonomous task-length roughly every seven months. In contrast, software-development agents operate with a hard reward signal: They either pass the unit test or they don’t. That verifiable feedback drives reinforcement learning that doubles task complexity every 70 days. The metric here is simple, how long the agent can run without human intervention. The sharper slope proves that hard, binary reward signals accelerate learning by an order of magnitude. That is the essential takeaway. Before crowning one model king, let’s look at the brutal economics of the models beneath the rise of agentic AI products. In the chart below, the Y-axis is the composite benchmark score; each colored step represents a new model release. The dark line highlights OpenAI’s leading model, which itself changes (with each square dot), and the quick catch-up by rivals (the other colored lines). The staircase chart plots an independent “AI-intelligence index” for frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, DeepSeek, Alibaba, and others over the past 24 months. What stands out is how small both dimensions have become. GPT-4o takes the lead but within weeks DeepSeek R1 or Gemini 3 closes the gap. Switching costs between APIs are measured in a few lines of Python code, so the CAP shortens with every release. In other words, you can spend a billion dollars on compute and data only to enjoy a six-week pricing umbrella before the market reduces your advantage to zero. The point is, spending $10 billion and multiple years on a frontier training run no longer guarantees a lasting edge. The moment a new model lands, the competitive lead can evaporate almost as quickly as a new consumer gadget cycle. Unlike the pharmaceutical industry – where patent protection secures a decade of exclusivity – model training enjoys no comparable moat. The current race revolves around ever‐larger compute clusters and incremental algorithmic tweaks. Hardware scale is available to any firm with sufficient capital; algorithmic insights diffuse quickly through open research and employee mobility. Proprietary training data helps, but it is only one ingredient and rarely decisive. To achieve both a substantial competitive-advantage gap and a durable competitive-advantage period, the game must shift. The next era will require an entirely different data foundation, one capable of conferring a sustained, defensible edge. That foundation is the enterprise digital twin discussed in the sections that follow. To tease the last section, Jamie Dimon and any other enterprise that can model their data into a digital twin of operations, can train proprietary agents that have a very high CAG and a durable CAP. All the capex may be going into a half-dozen or more frontier labs, but the sustainable differentiation will lie in these enterprises. Let’s now explore how this dynamic shows up in pricing models for the underlying frontier models. The chart below lays this out. Here’s the killer behind those shrinking advantage windows: token prices are in free-fall. Y-axis is log-scale price per million tokens (from $100 down to sub-penny). X-axis spans October 2021 to April 2025. Each diagonal line shows successive model releases driving price down an order of magnitude every few months. So USD per million tokens against release dates. Every colored trend-line is a different capability tier -GPT-3.5-class (teal), GPT-4-class (pink), GPT-4o-plus (blue). Regardless of tier, prices are declining on an exponential glide-path: In other words, you can burn $10 billion on GPT-6 training and watch the market re-price that output at a fraction of the margin in a single quarter. Throw in minimal switching costs for customers of the API and you get the picture. The point is that packaged agents — bundled with proprietary data and workflow context — are where we think the durable economics will live. The accelerating collapse in API pricing stands apart from the economics of products built on top. Venture capital is pouring into frontier labs at an unprecedented rate. Nation-state funds are underwriting domestic model efforts, Chinese labs are proliferating and high-profile entrants – Elon Musk among them – are scrambling to join the race. The parallel to the late-’90s internet bubble is hard to ignore – tens of billions chasing what increasingly looks like a mirage. Today the consumer-agent crown already sits with the incumbent leader, and the leading API position belongs to Anthropic. Durable differentiation will not come from another round of capital-intensive model training; it will come from doing something genuinely different. That necessity ushers in the next era, where the advantage shifts to differentiated data foundations and domain-specific agent platforms. Let’s come back to our three eras of AI. We’ve come full circle: Consumer chatbots got us started, coding agents proved to be a flywheel, but enterprise agents are where the real money — and long-term moat — will be built in our view. Think of the trajectory in three discrete eras, mapped on the curve you’ve seen all episode: The core takeaway is AI is programmed by data, and true durable differentiation will come from proprietary data. Consider JPMorgan Chase as a stand-in for any advanced enterprise. Initial estimates pegged its private corpus at roughly 150 petabytes – already hundreds of times the half-petabyte to 1-petabyte used to train a GPT-4-class model. More recent figures suggest the bank may hold on the order of an exabyte. Yet volume alone isn’t the story; it’s how that data is modeled to represent day-to-day operations. Enterprise data is dense, high-signal and – if properly organized – far richer than the broad, low-signal crawl that feeds frontier models. Unlocking that value demands several shifts: These elements will trigger new go-to-market motions, a fresh generation of application-platform vendors, revamped technical stacks, and — ultimately — organizational and business-model change for the enterprises that adopt them. Let’s dig into what enterprise AGI will actually look like. Below is a classic diagram many use to describe the elements of agentic AI – but key pieces are missing to power the enterprise in our view. Most agent diagrams look identical – tools on the left – calendar, calculator, code interpreter, search; cognitive modules on the right – planning, reflection, self-critique, chain-of-thought, sub-goal decomposition; a memory stack across the top; and an action port along the bottom. The entire picture is algorithm-centric because that is what computer-science researchers reward. Data hardly shows up, yet in the enterprise data is everything. This particular diagram – borrowed from a recent Stanford Computer Science lecture – omits the component that actually creates value – the environment or world model. An agent learns only by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback on the outcome. In academic settings that omission is an afterthought; in a business context it is the difference between a toy and a system that can move revenue, cost, or risk. The absence of a first-class data layer in mainstream agent thinking underscores why enterprise agents remain an under-explored frontier. The disruption is staring the industry in the face, but few acknowledge it because the conversation is dominated by algorithmic heroes rather than data realism. Let’s pull some examples from real-world models where agents got started. Before we take too many liberties with the phrase enterprise digital twin, it helps to remember the very first twins that ever mattered to AI researchers were seen in gaming. DeepMind’s AlphaStar learned to dominate StarCraft II not just because its model architecture was magic , but because the entire game environment – the 4-D map of units, resources, timing and fog-of-war – was exposed as a perfect, real-time, real-world model. On the graph below we show the match-making-rating or MMR percentile on the X-axis, skill level on the Y-axis. The blue curve is human progression from silver to grandmaster; the red dot is AlphaStar smashing through the top percentile – discovering strategies no human had ever tried, courtesy of reinforcement learning a digital twin. The crucial insight is the mapping of people, places, things and activities inside a game world to the same four dimensions — people, places, things and processes—inside a business. Conventional data platforms provide static snapshots, a kaleidoscope view. Agents require a richer, dynamic representation that captures how actions ripple across the enterprise. When an agent modifies a step in a process it needs the map to trace the impact on downstream people and workflows. Reinforcement learning flourished first inside environments that already contained such world models. DeepMind’s AlphaStar for StarCraft and OpenAI’s work on the Dota strategy game are canonical examples. Each environment supplied continuous, verifiable rewards – intermediate signals that tested strategic choices and an ultimate win-or-lose outcome. These conditions allowed agents to iterate rapidly and improve. The same principles apply to the enterprise. By constructing a four-dimensional digital twin – people, places, things, processes – businesses can deliver the feedback loops agents need to learn, adapt and ultimately drive measurable results across complex operations. Lessons from AlphaStar and Dota form the blueprint for this more advanced, enterprise-grade implementation. If an agent can exploit a synthetic world model to beat 99% of pro gamers, imagine what it can do when the “map” is a digital twin of a bank or a live model of a supply-chain. But that also means enterprises – not vendors – must own and curate the world model so the agent can learn with verifiable rewards. The point is that the lessons from AlphaStar will translate to finance, healthcare and manufacturing, anything with a digital twin. Minecraft serves as the next reference world model. In the Voyager project the environment is more open-ended than StarCraft. An agent starts by learning how to craft simple stone tools, then uses those tools to build basic structures. As competence grows it discovers how to forge more advanced implements, each new capability unlocking a broader range of tasks. Over time the agent accumulates skills and expands the set of tools at its disposal. That progressive, self-directed skill acquisition is critical because every new ability enriches the environment and, in turn, furnishes richer feedback for further learning. The pattern – learn a tool, use it to create value, learn the next tool – provides an important template for constructing an enterprise world model where agents continuously extend their own action space. Now let’s really try to double down on the importance of data. Every headline about AI credits the algorithm – AlexNet, Transformers, RLHF, the new reasoning stacks – but the right side of this slide reminds us that each breakthrough was really sparked by a new dataset era. A recent blog post by Jack Morrison, highlighted on the Latent Space podcast, underscores a recurring blind spot: Everyone fixates on algorithmic breakthroughs while ignoring the dataset hiding in plain sight. Morrison sketches the reasoning era and notes that agents will learn from verifiers — calculators for math, compilers and unit tests for code — yet leaves the critical dataset box essentially blank. The dataset is obvious. Every organization is building, or will build, a platform that captures an ever-larger digital twin of its operations. That twin — people, places, things, processes — is the immense, high-fidelity corpus that will power enterprise-grade reasoning. Let’s now connect enterprise agents with digital twins as we’re defining them. We’ve moved up the curve from consumer chat to coding / SWE agents – and the slide below shows how it all works inside a company. The chart from Palantir highlights at the bottom right an end-to end supply-chain twin; red call-outs on the left highlight RL feedback arrows feeding the agent box. The metric tree illustrates how “What happened?” rolls up to “What should we do?” Think of three layers working in concert: Installing a digital twin – like the Palantir schematic shown here – is only the first step. The engine that turns that representation into agent learning is the metric tree. Unlike conventional business intelligence dashboards, where key performance indicators live in isolated tables or hand-coded formulas, a metric tree links every measure in a learned, hierarchical graph. Change a node – say, authorizing a product return – and the tree reveals ripples across customer-support satisfaction, on-hand inventory and cash-flow metrics. The richer the twin, the higher the fidelity of those relationships. The agent sits above this structure and dynamically selects tools that correspond to analytical intent: If the tree lacks a metric, the agent adds one – mirroring how Voyager in “Minecraft” learned new tools and skills, then fed them back into the environment. Each new metric becomes a tool; each successful action becomes a skill; both flow into the twin, iteratively expanding its scope. The result is a self-reinforcing feedback loop: Agent actions enrich the symbolic model, and the enriched model, in turn, sharpens agent decisions. The twin need not be perfect on day one; it grows in lock-step with agent capability. Let’s look at how this will affect enterprise architecture. This graphic below builds on our previous work and pulls it all together. It also answers the question: Who is actually building a live, digital representation of the business? The graphic reprises the layered stack often used in Breaking Analysis and Services-as-Software. This pattern echoes the history of information technology: Each new abstraction layer envelops the one below. Lower layers keep innovating, but lose feature-based differentiation and pricing power once the upper layer decides which capabilities to expose. Traditional data platforms captured snapshots of strings; metric-centric platforms upgraded those to snapshots of things. The green layer goes further – capturing processes – bridging sixty years of application and data islands. A quick tour of the contenders: Margin and control will accrue to the layer that captures processes and feeds agents; data infrastructure, while indispensable, becomes the cost-optimized foundation beneath it. Let’s focus now on how enterprise software is splitting into two worlds. Picture the frozen-lake scene from the recent Bond film: Rami Malek’s villain stands unharmed on the glossy surface while a diver flails in the frigid water below. The metaphor captures how enterprise software is cleaving into two distinct worlds. The industry is aligning accordingly: players above the ice focus on modeled business context and higher-margin economics, while those below face mounting pressure to commoditize. The strategic choice is to move up into outcome-driven layers or prepare for tightening margins in the infrastructure trench. The discussion comes back to a single conclusion: Ownership of coherent, high-signal enterprise data is the deciding factor in the next wave of AI value capture. Labs may still dominate headline model releases, yet those models increasingly rely on proprietary ground-truth data that only large organizations possess in scale. On the visual above, Sam Altman anchors the left – world-famous foundation models. Amodei sits center-left, demonstrating that post-training on domain feedback can spin meaningful ARR. Center-right stands the prize everyone is pursuing. In our view, a live, verifiable digital twin of an enterprise is represented at the far right by Dimon, steward of the deepest transaction ledger in banking, perfectly positioned to weaponize that twin and challenge model labs on both margin and moat.

Title: ‘Go woke, go broke’ is no longer true. Socially aware capitalism is the future of corporate responsibility

View all partners Share article Print article The phrase “go woke, go broke” is often used by critics of corporate social responsibility. It implies that companies face a binary choice: embrace progressive values or pursue profit. But this dichotomy between “wokeness” and capitalism is both simplistic and increasingly out of step with corporate reality. Many companies are learning to navigate a middle path. They are embedding social, environmental and ethical considerations into their business strategies – not in spite of profit, but because it contributes to long-term value creation. Understanding this shift – and the backlash to it – is fundamental to grasping modern corporate responsibility. Our research examines the growing tension between evolving “woke” agendas within firms and the enduring demands of shareholder value, known as “shareholder revanchism”. We explore this dynamic using academic Archie Carroll’s Pyramid of Corporate Social Responsibility, where economic responsibility forms the foundation for higher legal, ethical and philanthropic obligations. Ultimately, we argue for a reassessment of the prevailing emphasis on shareholder profit and short-termism. Directors should adopt a more balanced approach when pursuing profit and discharging their duties. The idea that directors must choose between shareholders and stakeholders – between profit and progressive causes – has deep roots in law and economics. For decades, shareholder primacy prevailed in global business. This principle was famously reinforced in court decisions such as the 1919 Dodge v Ford case in the United States. Henry Ford was found to have a duty to operate his company in the interests of shareholders. It was later popularised by Milton Friedman, who declared that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits”. A stark example of this tension came with the ousting of Emmanuel Faber, chief executive of food giant Danone in 2021. Faber was accused by some shareholders of failing to “strike the right balance between shareholder value creation and sustainability”. His critics felt he focused too much on people, the planet and social responsibility and not enough on profits. Yet corporate law has begun to evolve. In the United Kingdom, section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 still requires directors to promote the success of the company “for the benefit of its members”. But the legislation also requires directors to consider employees, suppliers, communities and environmental outcomes. This model – sometimes termed “enlightened shareholder value” – preserves profit as the goal, while recognising that broader factors shape how it is achieved. New Zealand’s brief experiment with section 131 of the Companies Act 1993, which allowed directors to consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, is another example. The amendment was introduced under Labour before being revoked by the National-led coalition. Canada has a similar provision. The phrase “woke capitalism” was popularised in a 2018 New York Times opinion piece about corporate activism. It originally described how firms were supporting progressive causes to attract younger, values-driven consumers – not out of altruism, but to strengthen brand appeal. In 2019, the US Business Roundtable – a group of 200 top chief executives – rejected shareholder primacy in favour of stakeholder governance. It pledged to run companies for the benefit of all stakeholders: customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders. This followed a 2018 letter by Larry Fink, chairman of BlackRock, calling on firms to pursue a broader purpose and serve all their stakeholders. Yet corporate activism carries risks. Nike’s campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick boosted sales but sparked backlash over the American football player’s support for Black Lives Matter. Bud Light’s brief partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney triggered boycotts. Gillette’s “toxic masculinity” campaign alienated many long-time customers. Jaguar’s sales plunged after a rebrand was criticised as pandering. Even ice cream company Ben & Jerry’s has clashed with parent company Unilever over the limits of its political expression. These examples show that progressive branding is not always rewarded – but nor is silence. Companies now risk criticism for failing to speak out on issues their stakeholders care about. It is clear consumers are increasingly attuned to corporate social responsibility. A central challenge in reconciling these tensions is the definition of profit itself. Traditional corporate law treats profit as the ultimate end of business activity. But scholars such as Edward Freeman argue that profit is a precondition for continuity – not an end in itself. As he puts it, profit to a company is like red blood cells to a human: essential for survival, but not the purpose of life. Under this view, profit becomes cyclical. It is a means of sustaining activity, not a fixed destination. This may seem open ended, but it avoids the fiction that companies ever reach a final “profit goal”. Firms pursuing social impact are not abandoning capitalism; they are redefining it. In a polarised climate, “woke capitalism” remains a lightning rod. But the supposed conflict between ethics and economics is a false one. Courts, lawmakers and firms alike are recognising that social responsibility can support, rather than undermine, long-term value. Directors are no longer torn between duty and decency. They are navigating a broader understanding of corporate success – one in which “wokeness” and capitalism are not opposing forces, but interdependent elements of a sustainable business strategy.

Title: Figma vs. The Field: Why This IPO Outperformed Every Major Tech Debut Since 2020

Time Published: 2025-08-03T18:51:53Z

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Scale TL;DR: Figma’s $1.2 billion IPO at a $19.3 billion valuation that soared to $47.1 billion on day one represents one of the most successful tech IPOs in years, outperforming most major offerings since 2020 in terms of both fundamentals and market reception. Figma stands out even among recent high-growth software IPOs like Circle and CoreWeave, with year-over-year revenue growth approaching 50% and Q1 profitability. While 2020’s mega IPOs raised more capital in absolute terms, Figma’s combination of scale, profitability, and explosive first-day performance makes it the gold standard for how B2B companies should approach public markets in 2025. The Fundamentals: – $749 million revenue in 2024 (48% YoY growth), $1B ARR today – 91% gross margin with rolling 12-month revenue of $821 million – Q1 2025 net income of $44.9 million – profitability at scale – Over 13 million monthly users, with only one-third being designers – Around 450,000 customers as of March 31 The IPO Performance: – Priced at $33 per share (above initial $25-$28 range) – Opened at $85, hit intraday high of $124.63, closed first day at $115.50 – 250% first-day pop from offer price – Market cap jumped from $19.3 billion to $47.1 billion Snowflake (September 2020): – Raised $3.9 billion, largest software IPO ever at the time – Valued at $33 billion pre-trading, more than doubled on first day – Narrowly outperformed Nasdaq since initial pop Airbnb (December 2020): – Raised $3.4 billion at $47.3 billion valuation – 112% first-day jump – Up less than 3% since first day as of reporting DoorDash (December 2020): – Priced at $102, first trade at $182, 85% first-day gain – Investors who bought after initial pop lost money The Key Difference: All four 2020 mega IPOs (including Uber/Lyft from 2019) relied on vast amounts of outside capital to grow networks and only Airbnb recorded net profit in latest quarter after massive cost cuts. Figma achieved profitability while growing 48% YoY – a fundamentally different trajectory. CoreWeave (March 2025): – Priced below expectations at $40 per share ($20 billion valuation) – Up 270% since IPO – $981.6 million revenue (420% growth) but $314.6 million net loss – 77% of revenue from just two customers, Microsoft accounting for 62% Circle (June 2025): – Stock shot up 500% after debut – Raised $1.05 billion 1. True SaaS Economics at Scale Unlike the capital-intensive, low-margin businesses of 2020’s sharing economy giants, Figma demonstrates classic SaaS metrics that VCs dream about: – 91% gross margins (compared to traditional cloud infrastructure plays) – Subscription-based recurring revenue model – Expanding user base beyond core design market 2. Profitability Without Sacrificing Growth Figma generated net income in Q1 2025 while maintaining 46% YoY growth – something that eluded most 2020 IPO darlings. This proves the SaaS model’s inherent scalability when executed correctly. 3. Market Timing and Positioning Figma could serve as a bellwether for the market, providing proof-of-concept for other SaaS names like Canva, Netskope, and Databricks. The company went public at the perfect inflection point of IPO market recovery. 4. Platform Expansion Strategy Only one-third of Figma’s 13 million monthly users are designers, demonstrating successful expansion beyond initial TAM – a key growth vector that wasn’t present in most 2020 IPOs. 2021 saw a record 1,035 IPOs, with 155 U.S. venture-backed IPOs raising $60.4 billion. Three of the 10 biggest tech IPOs ever happened in 2020, with companies commanding valuations “seemingly untethered from any analytic metrics”. The IPO market essentially froze after 2021, with only 13 such offerings in 2022, 18 in 2023, and 30 in 2024, collectively raising just $13.3 billion. 201 IPOs so far in 2025, with IPO issuance estimated to range from 155 to 195 deals. June 2025 produced five tech IPOs, accelerating from a monthly average of two since January. Based on Figma’s template, the next wave of successful tech IPOs will likely include: – Canva ($32 billion valuation, $2.6 billion revenue, seven consecutive years of profitability) – Databricks (60% revenue growth, 140%+ net revenue retention) – Klarna ($2.8 billion revenue, returning to profitability) After Figma’s Massive IPO, Could Canva IPO at $200 Billion+? Figma’s IPO success isn’t just about market timing – it’s about building an incredibly sound SaaS business that grows efficiently, expands its market, and generates sustainable profits. In a market that’s both infatuated with AI but also becoming increasingly discerning at scale after the 2020-2021 excesses, Figma proves that great SaaS companies can still command premium valuations and deliver explosive public market debuts. SaaS isn’t dead. In fact, it’s bigger than ever. With its best IPO to date, so far. For founders building the next generation of SaaS companies, Figma’s path from design tool to connected platform to profitable public company offers the clearest roadmap to IPO success in today’s market environment. The bottom line: Figma didn’t just go public – it set the new standard for how exceptional SaaS companies should approach public markets in 2025 and beyond.

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The Nasdaq has been rallying nonstop since April. Let’s discuss three covered call fund payouts up to 11.2% that play the rally. The catalyst is the “rise of the machines” with companies replacing expensive humans with cheaper robots and AI tools. Hiring numbers are down and (paradoxically to some) the Nasdaq continues to levitate higher. This summer heater in tech stocks is no surprise to us contrarians. The Naz tech giants are enjoying expanding profit margins! Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy recently admitted the company’s workforce will shrink, replaced by AI. This is bad for those who work at Amazon, but great for those who own AMZN. Microsoft (MSFT) also announced big layoffs in recent months, especially in sales and support roles easily handled by AI-driven tools. And my friends at Alphabet (GOOG) are looking over their shoulders wondering how much longer their services will be needed. This is a dicey time to be a rank-and-file tech bro—but an exciting time to be a tech savvy dividend investor. Here are three “one-click” (or one-tap) dividend plays on this megatrend! Alphabet (GOOG) will never pay 11.2%. But we can buy GOOG and the rest of Big Tech for 11.2% payouts via a fund like Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD), which sells (“writes”) covered call funds on the Naz index itself to generate additional income. QYLD buys the stocks in the Nasdaq-100 and simultaneously writes covered calls on the index itself to generate income—which it pays out monthly. It’s not perfect exposure to technology. The Nasdaq-100 is made up of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, and in fact, it includes stocks from 10 different sectors. However, it’s still tech-heavy, at 60% of the index’s weight, and includes trillion-dollar tech firms like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), so it’s generally treated as a proxy for the sector. But that’s a marginal consideration. The real tradeoff to weigh is tactical. By selling covered calls against the Nasdaq, we’re sacrificing potential upside in return for a.) much more stability and b.) the very high income from the options premiums it collects. QYLD will rarely outperform the “QQQs” to the upside. But it also has less downside exposure, thanks to the constant income it generates by selling the call options. The JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income (JEPQ) uses a similar strategy, owning roughly 100 or so Nasdaq stocks while selling calls against the Nasdaq-100. It also doles out its massive dividend in monthly distributions. But it’s a little more flexible because of a big difference between it and QYLD: management. Whereas QYLD tracks an index and typically has only one options position at any given moment, JEPQ is led by 38-year veteran Hamilton Reiner and a team of four co-managers who can sell multiple contracts. I’ve also pointed out in the past that while both funds hold pretty much the same stocks, JEPQ is more heavily weighted in mega-cap names than QYLD. But that’s not by definition. Indeed, today, JEPQ has a smaller percentage of assets invested in each of its top 10 holdings than QYLD. These might not seem like meaningful differences, but over time we see that JPMorgan’s “homemade” strategy beat QYLD’s straightforward approach. Active management can make a world of difference—so much so that I typically prefer closed-end funds (CEFs) over comparable ETFs. Let’s walk over to the CEF side of the border to review our final call writer. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is a CEF, while QYLD and JEPQ are ETFs. But the differences go far beyond fund type. Paul Wick, who has nearly four decades of experience, and a team of five other managers run a slimmer portfolio of about 55 holdings.

Title: How To Collect Dividends Up To 11% From Tech Stocks

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The Nasdaq has been rallying nonstop since April. Let’s discuss three covered call fund payouts up to 11.2% that play the rally. The catalyst is the “rise of the machines” with companies replacing expensive humans with cheaper robots and AI tools. Hiring numbers are down and (paradoxically to some) the Nasdaq continues to levitate higher. This summer heater in tech stocks is no surprise to us contrarians. The Naz tech giants are enjoying expanding profit margins! Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy recently admitted the company’s workforce will shrink, replaced by AI. This is bad for those who work at Amazon, but great for those who own AMZN. Microsoft (MSFT) also announced big layoffs in recent months, especially in sales and support roles easily handled by AI-driven tools. And my friends at Alphabet (GOOG) are looking over their shoulders wondering how much longer their services will be needed. This is a dicey time to be a rank-and-file tech bro—but an exciting time to be a tech savvy dividend investor. Here are three “one-click” (or one-tap) dividend plays on this megatrend! Alphabet (GOOG) will never pay 11.2%. But we can buy GOOG and the rest of Big Tech for 11.2% payouts via a fund like Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD), which sells (“writes”) covered call funds on the Naz index itself to generate additional income. QYLD buys the stocks in the Nasdaq-100 and simultaneously writes covered calls on the index itself to generate income—which it pays out monthly. It’s not perfect exposure to technology. The Nasdaq-100 is made up of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, and in fact, it includes stocks from 10 different sectors. However, it’s still tech-heavy, at 60% of the index’s weight, and includes trillion-dollar tech firms like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), so it’s generally treated as a proxy for the sector. But that’s a marginal consideration. The real tradeoff to weigh is tactical. By selling covered calls against the Nasdaq, we’re sacrificing potential upside in return for a.) much more stability and b.) the very high income from the options premiums it collects. QYLD will rarely outperform the “QQQs” to the upside. But it also has less downside exposure, thanks to the constant income it generates by selling the call options. The JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income (JEPQ) uses a similar strategy, owning roughly 100 or so Nasdaq stocks while selling calls against the Nasdaq-100. It also doles out its massive dividend in monthly distributions. But it’s a little more flexible because of a big difference between it and QYLD: management. Whereas QYLD tracks an index and typically has only one options position at any given moment, JEPQ is led by 38-year veteran Hamilton Reiner and a team of four co-managers who can sell multiple contracts. I’ve also pointed out in the past that while both funds hold pretty much the same stocks, JEPQ is more heavily weighted in mega-cap names than QYLD. But that’s not by definition. Indeed, today, JEPQ has a smaller percentage of assets invested in each of its top 10 holdings than QYLD. These might not seem like meaningful differences, but over time we see that JPMorgan’s “homemade” strategy beat QYLD’s straightforward approach. Active management can make a world of difference—so much so that I typically prefer closed-end funds (CEFs) over comparable ETFs. Let’s walk over to the CEF side of the border to review our final call writer. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is a CEF, while QYLD and JEPQ are ETFs. But the differences go far beyond fund type. Paul Wick, who has nearly four decades of experience, and a team of five other managers run a slimmer portfolio of about 55 holdings. The portfolio is also a purer—though not pure—play on technology, with about 70% of assets dedicated to the sector. STK also is interested in “growth at a reasonable price” (GARP); a relatively more value-priced portfolio shows it, with price-to-earnings, sales, book, and cash flow all lower than the other ETFs. And whereas QYLD tries to own Nasdaq-100 stocks (and while JEPQ has a broader mandate but looks index-esque in its larger holdings), STK is much more willing to take some shots—stocks such as Lam Research (LRCX) and industrial Bloom Energy (BE) punch well above their weight.

Title: Big Tech has cut over 100,000 jobs this year — and the AI revolution is just getting started

Since the start of the year, Big Tech has shed over 100,000 jobs. Sure, some of these layoffs are just standard corporate belt tightening, but it is now clear that AI is impacting the job market — and entry- and mid-level workers are being hit the hardest. This underscores a defining question of our time: Will AI lead to widespread unemployment, or will it create new opportunities and industries that we can’t yet imagine? So far, AI is displacing jobs faster than new ones are being created. The displacement of workers through automation is nothing new. Emerging technologies upend legacy companies and industries, and usher in new organizations with better jobs with higher pay. It’s a cycle that’s been dubbed “creative destruction” by economist Joseph Schumpeter. Throughout history, that has meant short-term pain for long-term gain — at least for some. On the one hand, the automobile put farriers and stage-coach drivers out of business but created millions of good-paying jobs for automotive assembly workers and truck drivers. On the other, the internet replaced many department-store clerks, travel agents, taxi drivers and journalists with Amazon fulfillment center workers, Uber drivers, content creators and others who often work more hours for less pay with fewer benefits. And in the Rust Belt and factory towns, automation has eliminated countless workers with no obvious replacement in sight. The disruption from AI could make this look like kids’ stuff. Historically, technology has automated workers at the periphery — those with low skills that can easily be substituted. AI will automate everything, everywhere, all at once, displacing knowledge workers and managers in every industry. Ironically, tradespeople like welders, electricians, plumbers and carpenters who were told “learn to code” may be the last to get automated away. Already, engineers at Amazon are complaining that their role has been degraded as they’re asked to do more with AI. There is an added concern that AI will kill many careers before they begin. In a recent interview with Axios, Dario Amodei, CEO of AI darling Anthropic, said AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years. A LinkedIn executive echoed this sentiment in a recent New York Times essay with the alarming title “The bottom rung of the career ladder is breaking,” citing at-risk entry-level jobs such as paralegals and call center operators. Tech CEOs seem unfussed by the potential of a looming cataclysm — if anything, they’re doing what they can to usher it in. Mark Zuckerberg told Joe Rogan this year that AI will replace most of Meta’s mid-level engineers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said last year that AI already writes 30% of the company’s code. In the last few months, Microsoft has fired more than 15,000 people. Shareholders are rewarding executives that adopt AI and slash headcount: Microsoft’s stock just hit an all time high. Not all tech workers are suffering. In fact, a few super-engineers are reaping unprecedented windfalls from the AI revolution, commanding pay packages of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and stock that would make hedge-fund managers or superstar athletes blush. Not all tech workers are suffering. In fact, a few super-engineers are reaping unprecedented windfalls from the AI revolution, commanding pay packages of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and stock that would make hedge-fund managers or superstar athletes blush. As he’s musing about mass cuts to his workforce to Rogan, Zuckerberg is also poaching the top AI minds from competitors like OpenAI and Apple with eye-popping pay packages. Ruoming Pang was lured away from Apple with an offer worth $200 million — triple what Apple CEO Tim Cook made last year. Is AI exposing yet another fault line between haves and have-nots? Is this a harbinger of what we can come to expect from an AI economy? So far AI has created huge wealth for founders, investors and the top 0.01% of tech talent. But what about the rest of us? This goes beyond business with implications for governments and society. President Trump initially rose to popularity by tapping into the anger and fears of an aging blue-collar work force who felt left behind by globalization and automation. He sustained his appeal by broadening his coalition to include a more diverse and younger part of the electorate, namely Gen Z men, who are among the most at-risk groups when it comes to being replaced by AI. An economy where young people can’t find work could deepen Gen Z’s economic pessimism into existential nihilism. New technologies are always greeted with a mixture of hope, trepidation and outright pessimism. Ultimately, technology has no agency. It is not morally good or bad. It is a tool, created and wielded by people. Human beings learned to make fire, and cook food, stay warm and clear land for agriculture — or burn down a rival’s hut.

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Amazon's stock dropped 8.3% as AWS's growth significantly lagged rivals like Azure and Google Cloud, disappointing investors despite strong retail sales.AWS's slower growth stems from its lack of integrated proprietary AI models and a strategy requiring high technical expertise, hindering adoption in the generative AI age.Analysts express skepticism regarding Amazon's ability to compete effectively in AI, citing CEO Jassy's unconvincing explanations and AWS's strategic shortcomings. Amazon stock fell 8.3% in after-hours trading on Thursday following a mixed second quarter report, according to CNBC. Why? Although Amazon’s retail business performed well, investors expressed disappointment with the growth pace of Amazon Web Services – which grew more slowly than Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Analysts were left wanting more from CEO Andy Jassy’s explanations during the conference call for AWS’s relatively slow growth. Amazon’s fundamental problem is its failure to adapt to the competitive imperatives of the generative AI age, noted my book Brain Rush. This age has been propelled by two companies – OpenAI which supplied the fast-growing ChatGPT and Nvidia, the designer of AI chips for speeding the training and operation of AI chatbots. Amazon seems to be applying the strategy it used to pioneer the cloud services industry to the AI cloud market – where it is struggling to catch up. More specifically, unlike Microsoft and Google – which have access to proprietary integrated AI chatbots (ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively) – AWS’s strategy of handing off to developers the task of choosing and integrating individual computing services requires more technical expertise – thereby slowing adoption. To grow faster, Jassey ought to consider three possible strategies: Since Jassy helped build AWS and has yet to demonstrate a compelling vision for competing with faster growing rivals, I am skeptical of whether Amazon will be able to leapfrog these rivals. “Our conviction that AI will change every customer experience is starting to play out," Jassy said in an earnings release. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead,” he added. I have requested comment from Amazon and will update this post if I receive a response. Amazon’s second quarter results blended above expectations sales and earnings with a mixed forecast for the future and a shaky explanation for why AWS is growing more slowly in the age of AI. Here are the key numbers: Amazon and its hyperscaler rivals – such as Google and Meta – are increasing their capital expenditures. For example, Amazon is boosting capital expenditures 42% to $118 billion in 2025, Google’s will reach $85 billion and Meta forecast $69 billion in 2025 capex, according to CNBC. Investors are using growth rates as a proxy for the return on AI investments. Since AWS is growing at roughly half the rate of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, investors see a problem with AWS’s strategy. Jassy’s responses to analyst questions about AWS’ relatively slow growth did not directly address the question. He said the faster-growing second ranked rival was “65%” the size of AWS, highlighted Microsoft’s security woes – notably the hacking of SharePoint, and suggested it was “early days” in AI, according to the Q2 earnings conference call transcript. These comments did not offer a compelling explanation of why Amazon – with 30% market share to Microsoft Azure’s 20%, according to Synergy Group -- is growing about half the rate of challengers. Since Jassy sidestepped the question, here are two reasons I think AWS is growing more slowly than rivals: Here are three strategies Amazon must pursue to grow faster than its cloud services rivals: These recommendations may be difficult to implement and may not result in new services that deliver more value to customers than those from faster-growing rivals. That’s partly because they are at odds with Amazon’s culture. For example, Amazon believes in inventing and improving its own solutions – as it did with AWS and Alexa. Therefore the recommended partnerships may be at odds with the company’s culture. Moreover, as former CEO of AWS, Jassy may have strategic blind spots. These could include viewing AI as primarily an infrastructure challenge that Amazon can solve with superior engineering. Jassy may also be dismissing the more rapid growth of rivals as superficial, as he did during the investor conference call, rather than a sign customers value AI cloud services from Microsoft and Google more highly. Is Amazon stock – which has lost 2.4% of its value so far in 2025 – trading at a bargain price? Some analysts sound skeptical: Despite this skepticism, analysts see Amazon stock as slightly undervalued. Of the 52 analysts who cover Amazon, the stock has 9.2% upside based on an average price target of $255.72, according to Zacks. Unless AWS’ revenue growth and operating profit accelerate, that modest gain could prove difficult to achieve.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings: Magnificent 7 Outperform Growth Expectations
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/03/second-quarter-earnings-magnificent-7-outperform-growth-expectations/
Time Published: 2025-08-03T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. This week is the second busiest of the second-quarter earnings season, with 124 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Pfizer (PFE), Yum! Brands (YUM), McDonald’s (MCD), Caterpillar (CVX), and Walt Disney (DIS). The Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) released better-than-expected earnings on Saturday. Warren Buffett continues to be a net seller of stocks. All the details about Berkshire’s quarterly earnings are here. According to FactSet, 82% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 66% of companies having already reported results. Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 10.3% year-over-year, above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 9.9%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.8%. Despite the better earnings results, the S&P 500 retreated from all-time highs last week, with jobs, increased tariffs, and escalating tension with Russia weighing on the index. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to blowout earnings from Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) reported robust earnings growth, which also continued to reinforce the artificial intelligence earnings narrative. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) also beat consensus estimates by a healthy margin with their earnings reports, but both stocks traded lower last week on concerns about the outlook. NVIDIA (NVDA) is the last of the Magnificent 7 to report results, scheduled for August 27. Positive earnings surprises from the technology, consumer discretionary, and communication services sectors were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 5.0% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. Better sales results in the healthcare, consumer discretionary, and technology sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. While the first-quarter headline GDP understated the underlying trend of the US economy, the second-quarter headline GDP number overstates the economy’s strength due to fluctuations in trade related to tariffs. Due to the trade distortion, final sales to private domestic purchasers are a better measure to watch, and they slowed to a 1.2% pace after the 1.9% growth in the first quarter. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the US private sector. Monthly nonfarm payrolls grew by a below-consensus 73,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%. There was a shockingly significant downward revision in payroll jobs over the previous months, chopping off 258,000 jobs from what was previously reported. Downward revisions, especially of this magnitude, are a sign that the labor market is cooling. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The deterioration in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence that the labor market is softening. While one should not jump to conclusions after one ugly month, it should be monitored closely for a continuation of the downtrend. The weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits have deteriorated slightly, indicating that the unemployed are having a harder time finding another job. Still, it has been a slow leak rather than a collapse so far. It is the second busiest week of earnings season, before earnings reports slow markedly next week. The shockingly soft monthly jobs report on Friday sent the odds of a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) soaring. Markets are currently pricing in an 87% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the September meeting. There aren’t any top-tier economic releases next week, but Fedspeak will be monitored closely for any reaction to the monthly payroll report. Last week, President Trump announced new reciprocal tariff rates for countries not yet reaching a trade deal with the US. Generally, these new tariff rates become effective on August 7. News about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. More sectoral tariffs could also be forthcoming. After hitting an all-time high last Monday, stocks retreated in the wake of a shockingly poor jobs report, increased tariffs, and escalating geopolitical tension with Russia. Stocks had been boosted by the twin forces of better-than-expected earnings and a receding threat of recession. While the earnings story continues, particularly in the AI-related technology space, an increase in the odds of recession weighed on risk appetite.

She knows too much and can name far too many powerful names. This whole performance right now is her showing that so long as she gets a pardon, she can be counted on to protect them. Any congressional testimony that she would give would be well rehearsed and by bipartisan agreement, there would be no real questions asked of her that had not been agreed upon. I don’t think that Trump will give her a pardon anytime soon as that would blow up support from most of his base but he could do so as he leaves the Presidency when any odium would all be on him but who could care less. Supposedly they moved her to a minimum security prison in Texas. More comfortable, better food, full dental. Gee, I wonder what the consideration was for that? It’s also the current home of fraudster Elizabeth Holmes. I would think that the kind of upper-middle class perps there would shun the likes of Maxwell. She should be careful of what she wishes for. For Ghislaine, there is a barrister showing photographs Of every head she’s had the pleasure to know And all the young girls that come and go Stop and say hello On the corner is nobility with a motorcar And everybody laughs at Andy behind his back And the billionaire never wears a rubber in the pouring rain Very strange Ghislaine is in my ears and in my eyes Vet beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back in Ghislaine, there is a minimum security prison in Texas And in her pocket is a pardon from his esteemed She likes to keep her record clean It’s a clean machine Ghislaine, is in my ears and in my eyes A tour d’farce and insidious lies In summer, meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of a cell block A jailbird is about to go astray And though she feels as if she’s in a play She is anyway Ghislaine is in my ears and in my eyes Vet beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back Ghislaine is in my ears and in my eyes Vet beneath the blue suburban skies Ghislaine Penny Lane, by the Beatles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7syIxQCquo&list=RDz7syIxQCquo I know this is cynical, but the women’s life expectancy has to be pretty short, whether she’s in prison or not. I think its a simple a matter of “the women who knows too much”. The fact that she is still alive suggests everyone assumes she has some kind of dead-man switch for release of incriminating information. Always wondered why Epstein didn’t. Though if he were actually still alive somewhere… Just speculating Her daddy didn’t. Arrogance? Yes but he got a prime burial plot on the Mount of Olives. Maybe that was his final deal as he jumped off his luxury yacht instead of being pushed by a mossad agent. I doubt that Maxwell has all that much in the way of salacious information to bargain with, but it should be enough to get housed (against all FBP rules) in a minimum security “camp” until her sentence is commuted for “good behavior.” The pardon won’t come until Trump’s headed out the door. Maxwell and Epstein were pimps, not pedophiles (a sexual interest in pre-pubescent children). They pandered to the tastes of wealthy, powerful, and often married, men for youthful “models” to cavort with in the present and to breed with after the collapse (the really creepy part). It was easy to groom these “models” for the sex trade when they were 15-17 years of age — one of the oldest stories in the book. Like any good pimp Epstein got first dibs. Offensively exploitative but hardly shocking. Listening to Michael Wolff, the real dirt is that Epstein and Maxwell have evidence that Trump was laundering money for Russian oligarchs off-shoring their cash when the Putin government started clawing back their ill-gotten gains from the ‘90’s. Epstein told Wolff that Trump ratted him out to the FBI in 2008 in retaliation for Epstein’s threats to expose the financial shell-game behind the sale of the Maison de l’Amité in Palm Beach to art-collector and AC Monaco football-owner Dmitry Rybolovlev, after Trump froze him out of the deal. Epstein told Wolff that he was convinced (and probably had the dirt) that Trump had conspired with Rybolovlev to falsely inflate the value of the property through secret loans and a sham re-sale, evading money laundering rules and capital gains taxes — a pretty serious crime. I don’t see how you can assert that Epstein and Maxwell were not pedophiles and minimize their sex trafficking. The Federal law that criminalizes traveling abroad for the sole purpose of having sex puts the age of consent at 18 (even though the law seems to be broader, I infer that in practice it is prosecuted only when the trip can be reasonably demonstrated to be for sex only) . It’s called “child sex tourism”: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html It’s been widely reported that some of the Lolita Express trips were to haul back underage women and that Epstein partook of his wares. There are also reports of Epstein and Maxwell having menage a trois with underage girls. Under most legal definitions “pedophilia” is defined as the unnatural sexual interest in pre-pubescent children — generally defined as below the age of 14. It is only since the 1970’s that “the age of consent” was raised above 15 in most U.S. states and is still as young as 13 in a shocking number of states. Child marriage is actually still legal in most states. There is a second legal category of “underage” persons who are subject to “statutory rape” laws, but most of these violations are not felonious. This is why Epstein and Maxwell were prosecuted for Sex Trafficking rather than Child Molestation. While these two creeps groomed a few children, their sexual exploitation was of young people under the age of majority but over the age of consent. This is why still I maintain (as I have for years) that Trump’s real Epstein problem is money laundering and tax evasion. Los Angeles city workers and police officers began clearing out a major homeless encampment near the 405 Freeway on July 31, removing trash, tents and an estimated 50–75 unhoused residents from a patch of Van Nuys sidewalk that had become known as “Tent City” or “The Compound.” “This is a notorious encampment,” Mayor Karen Bass told reporters at the scene. “This is such a dangerous location. I saw propane canisters all over the place. This is dangerous.” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Stridently never mentioned in the midst and aftermath of the well spread out January LA Infernos was the idea that the 72,308 or so homeless living in the City of Angles have outdoor fires all the time and not just propane ones. Careless people shouldn’t be playing with matches, but there you have it. Those tiny propane canisters which cannot be refilled, and should not be placed in regular garbage bins? Safer to sit around than be mishandled. Wake me when Coleman provides a responsible way for people to turn these in. You’re supposed to puncture butane cartridges before recyling them. Not sure about propane. But I’d expect they’re used until completely empty. I heard something about California banning the non-refillable ones but idk the status of that. The refillable ones cost more but pay for themselves after two or so refills. You can refill the non-refillable ones too, people do that all the time, I don’t think it’s even illegal per se, you’re just not allowed to transport them in a car after refilling. “China just bet $2 billion on fusion energy. The US must respond.” Sooo, is this The Hill saying that there is now a fusion energy gap? And the US must respond with $20 billion or however much it takes to beat those damn Chinese? Man, I have been hearing about fusion energy coming to solve all our energy problems since the 80s and scientists & engineers have spent their entire carers trying to make it come true. God knows how much has been spent on this dream all this time but I am willing to bet that it is far more than the $2 billion that the Chinese are talking about here. Seriously, $2 billion isn’t ‘a major new national bet’ by the Chinese. It’s a down payment to see if there is any promise here. But as the writer of this article is the CEO of Commonwealth Fusion Systems, I can guess why he says all this- https://cfs.energy/ What I understood from the original article this one referred to, Chinese are expecting commercial fusion energy around 2040, but are now starting companies that produce the tech needed to get there. So that when other nations join in, they’ll buy Chinese tech rather than waste time trying to develop their own. A bit like getting rich during a cold rush by selling the food and equipment the hopeful will need in their quest. We used to joke that if you ask an American fusion researcher when fusion power will be available, they will always answer “1 year after I retire.” It’s just the author of the article, the CEO of a USian fusion venture, talking his book. All my life it’s been 30 years away. I doubt it’s gotten any closer. Pastor: God made me do it– Back in the good old days, it was the devil made me do it.

Was just reading his Wikipedia entry and of course George Carlin was one of the show’s writers- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_Wilson But I did note this sentence- ‘Wilson was the first African American to host a successful TV variety show’ Are there many still doing so on American variety shows? I’ve seen some here on Oz TV like Letterman, Colbert & Fallon but when you think about it, they are all tall glasses of milk. ‘Wilson was the first African American to host a successful TV variety show’ Nat King Cole had a show in 1956- 57 http://www.classictvinfo.com/TheNatKingColeShow/ Geraldine! / ;) I loved Flip Wilson’s skits when I was a kid. And in his Geraldine performance on Ed Sullivan, he’s wearing a fantastic suit. Re ‘Artificial stupidity’ made AI trading bots spontaneously form cartels when left unsupervised, Wharton study reveals If I understood this article correctly, the headline is misleading. The bots demonstrated herd behaviour (rather than forming cartels) not because they were communicating with one another (which I take to be a requirement in order to fit the definition of “collusion”) but because they were all trained the same way and ended up receiving the same market outcome information simultaneously, thus leading to identical behaviour. Did I miss something? You got it. They’re just like our own ruling classes. Isn’t the goal of AI to mimic humans? Unfortunately it seems that, for some areas of knowledge, most of the AI training material comes from ignorant loudmouths who don’t think… Menschliches, allzu menschliches. Back when I was doing long range risk analysis, we found it depressingly easy to develop artificial stupidity simulations which consistently replicated both self-serving recommendations by predatory consultants and the corporations who loved them, and disastrous decisions by the clueless policymakers who followed their advice. The models accurately predicted actual long term outcomes pretty much every time. Leavitt to Believer In this week’s episode Lumpy Rutherford thinks it’s funny when Believer Cleavers are grounded after Karoline tricks them into a sense of false security by actually being honest in one utterance. Hilarity ensues. She’s officially now the teacher’s pet-the app(aratchick) of his eye. “At 17, Hannah Cairo Solved a Major Math Mystery” Just goes to show you that mathematics does not care who you are. It does not care about your colour, your background, your class, your religion, your sex, your age or anything like that. It only cares if you can understand it and I give kudos to this young girl and hope we hear more of her. But then there was this bit- ‘Cairo applied to 10 graduate programs. Six rejected her because she didn’t have a college degree. Two admitted her, but then higher-ups in those universities’ administrations overrode those decisions. Only the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University were willing to welcome her straight into a doctoral program.’ After this groundbreaking paper which is making mathematicians around the world sit up, 80% of the colleges that she applied to knocked her back because – wait for it – she didn’t have the “accreditation” on her resume. Jesus wept. I think the same was true with Einstein at one of the institutions, although I can’t remember the particulars now… Yep. All the people in my field generally published their earth changing papers due to discussion and feedback from people when they got recruited on criteria that definitely weren’t “were you Oxbridge/Ivy League?” Accreditation didn’t do it. Raw talent did. The “longtime God of math psych who I worked with” rejected Oxbridge, went to Brum, and simply worked on topics that were interesting. He’d got so senior that nobody could tell him “you can’t do that”. He got his 2nd wind after “retirement” when kept on as emeritus professor….. told me he felt like a post doc doing WTF he wanted with no stupid admin. I used to give him a lift to/from office in my car. Good times chewing the fat. Him also telling me LOADS of gossip about people the MSM fawn over. I always thought the peer review (and P&T process) makes that essentially impossible for youngish people to go off the beaten path, especially in disciplines that have identity issues (most soc sci fit.) What do I mean? Well, I can say a fair bit about how poli sci has been evolving last few decades: if you listen to the details in the debates over some big topics, parties, ideology, institutions, rule of law, etc, you start realizing that those are some peculiar definitions. Then you look at the methodologies and realize that the definitions are largely driven by the need to measure things and sic statistical methods on them. This, to me, is fine, up to a point–all of stats, or, indeed sciences generally, suffer from the problem. Assumptions are often stupid and are driven by a need to make things simple enough to handle. So errors are homoskedastic, friction does not exist, and so on…and everyone knows that these are not true. In soc sci, this awareness is not very strong: the stupid assumptions wind up driving the argunents and debates and stuff like “rationality” wind up being too central to the debate. Even the people who are aware of the problems wind up peddling stupid “fixes” (my advisor literally called them “epicycles.”) From the science side of the ledger, epicycles are dangerous because a model with a lot of epicycles can account for pretty much everything by definition. One can raise degrees of freedom questions, but, at least in practice, how the tradeoff between parsimony and alleged explanatory power works is not clear–especially since we know the social universe is more complicated than the natural, let alone the physical. In some sense, the trend towards “science,” at least in certain social sciences, seems to have instead brought scientism that tended to strengthen the dogmas that people have to adhere to if they want to go anywhere. Math and physics are, among others, somewhat freer fron this because they have stricter and clearer standards for what counts as useful insights. Even then, we still have many people who are very good at computation who can’t get there, well, because real insights are hard. Agreed. I have seen it said that a problem with first year econ is that to make it viable you Must use these simplifications….. but are told “we’ll relax these later”. But there *IS* no later for 99%. So 99% learn garbage. In reality they really would have done better learning the tips I learnt later. These are closer to “real” hard sciences or mathematics (with identity relationships). If they’d done so they’d immediately spot why 1st year econ is a crock and by rights should be in the faculty of theology in most cases. PS I was actually threatened in person by a senior person in health economics when a clever editor clocked his attempt to sabotage my paper in peer review (I co-authored with the God of math psych so the paper was rock solid). The threat was cunningly worded so as to give plausible deniability as to physical/reputation damage but I NEVER forgot. I got to ask some discreet questions about the guy later in my career, and yes, he was untouchable with it strongly implied he had links to EU decision makers. Yep, all made sense…..but all this must remain ALLEGED. It began a process whereby I voted LEAVE. No I never ever believed the leave campaign promises….. no I never believed we’d do better. It was a Samson move. Bring your house down too. I don’t appreciate threats sanctioned by the EU. Yikes. I have some bad experiences in peer reviews that got too “personal” myself (truly “blind” peer reviews don’t really happen, methinks), but that seems particularly awful. I was going to follow up with a curious experience I had talking to a quasi-colleague (I guess) who teaches something that’s a lot more humanities than anything quasi science who experimented lately with having an AI write and grade papers, and his experience was that AI was very good at both writing and identifying low A/A- papers, but terrible at identifying very good ones. I pointed out that this makes perfect sense given AI typically operates: it creates a “rule/formula/rubric” for what a “correct” paper should look like and docks points off for deviations from it. So it will produce solid papers that covers all grounds and does everything mechanically “correctly,” but it will have problems deviating from the rules. The way my colleague thinks, the really good papers deviates from the “norm” in some “brilliant” fashion, although what eactly that “brilliance” means is not clear a priori (although, who knows, if AI sees enough data and if there are common threads across many professors teaching the topic, maybe it can figure the “rule” out). So, as far as AI is conerned, at least with the data it got, high A papers and varying degrees of B papers are indistinguishable, since they all deviated to some significant degree from the “norm.” I did suggest to him that it would be interesting to see if the AI can generate, using the same procedure, a range of B papers, and I’m eager to see what comes out of this exerise. But this, of course, is not just “AI” thing. Bureaucracy works this way, and, in a way, so does the “standardization” process in academic life. There are “rules” of what works in the fashionable argument given the current trends (and in poli sci, the trends are heavily methodlogy driven–we don’t have a soul, so we try to mimic the “good” methodology in other disciplines and shoehorn them into our debates. Sometimes, these are very insightful. Other times, they involve some creative assumptions that should force you to think. Both are true more often than not, though.), but the interest is more on the “results,” assuming that the universe follows the “rules,” though, than what takes place under the hood. In an odd way, very AI-like process. AI is the final triumph of process over judgment. Every bureaucrat’s dream. Fortunately it is a stochastic and self-consuming process and contains the seeds of its own downfall, like the scene in Brazil where the hero connects the bureaucratic input to the output with no human in the loop. More literally than not, I think. I firmly believe in the implication of Arrow’s theorem: that every formulaic process can be gamed to engineer certain set of outcomes while strictly sraying within the rules–thus leading to internal contradictions. For the “bureaucracy” to retain influence, it needs some kind of randomization in how it operates. (This, in turn, begs the question–can computers randomize? Can people ranodomize, even? My understanding–and I’m out of date by a few decades–is that most humans can’t randomize very well, except very good mathematicians and ypung children (odd factoid given the Quanta link.) can computers randomize? I gather that generating truly random numbers is in fact not so easy. Most machines, languages, OSes have some kind of random() function, but generally it is a pseudo-random number generator that starts from a seed value (thus the seed values you see as inputs to generative AI apps), ergo the ‘random’ numbers tend to follow a sequence and are deterministic, i.e., same seed value, same sequence. So there are hacks tricks like using the millisecond counter as the seed value. This is considered “good enough” for most applications. Apparently, Cloudflare uses a wall of 100 lava lamps with a camera pointed at them, to generate random values for secure encryption keys (they copped this idea from Silicon Graphics). Pseudo-randomisation by computers is CRUCIAL in reproducing and checking (for instance) the Fortran written simulations I ran in my PhD. The seeds were all documented. So results were reproducible and checkable. Sadly, I think the seeds of destruction are rooted in every bureaucracy, every process, and it usually comes down to gaming of the system. It’s something I’ve always struggled with when it comes to imagining what an ‘ideal’ governmental or administrative system would look like. I wonder whether there is a deep relationship with Gögel’s theorem (that in every formal system strong enough to be of general application, undecidable propositions can be formulated)? I have always viewed Gödel’s theorem as a refutation of the logical positivists in humanities such as law, that it is not possible to have a universal rule-based legal reasoning because at some point you have to step outside logic to choose between mutually contradictory positions (but it would be possible for limited toy “expert systems”). This is also an argument against AI in legal reasoning. Fundamentally, you can pretend to derive everything from your axioms and logic but if you claim universality of application then at some point you will run into a contradiction that requires you to invent or amend an axiom to resolve and that step does not admit process/logic, only belief/intuition/judgment. This applies to other fields as well, e.g. religion. Arrow’s theorem mirrors this. The bureaucratic process (axioms plus logic) will hit the buffers. The aspect of chance you refer to would give it a way to surmount this constraint and decide the otherwise undecideable but, of course, the system ceases to be deterministic. And that aspect of chance was what physics had to accept in quantum mechanics (in most formulations of its meaning)…. Perhaps the social sciences have yet to have their quantum revolution…? Ivan Illich used to quip that there was something strange with conflating diplomas with knowledge. I often think about that. Clearly she’s in no need of going through the hassle of getting all the papers, as she has proven she is the equal (or perhaps the superior!) of many mathematicians with full diplomas. If she has decided she has no need for all the university years, who in the world could possibly refute her? I can just about guarantee that all of the mathematics departments she applied to would have wanted to take her. We’re explicitly told that two of them were overruled. I suspect some of the others were pre-screened and didn’t even see the application. I think if there had been one she had her heart set on, a personal contact from her advisor followed by a call or even a visit would have been the way to go: get her on the faculty radar, so they can go to bat for her. If she already did that then it means credentialism is further advanced than I thought. Great story, in any case. Mathematics, perhaps more than any other discipline, has always welcomed amateurs. You don’t need expensive lab equipment or a department – if you’ve got the books, the brain, and the patience, you can make a contribution. Galois invented his theory of groups, that later became famous, at a similar age (she even looks a little like his portrait). Hopefully she fares better than he did – he died in a duel at age 20. After this groundbreaking paper which is making mathematicians around the world sit up, 80% of the colleges that she applied to knocked her back because – wait for it – she didn’t have the “accreditation” on her resume. Jesus wept. I took it to mean they wanted her to enroll in an undergraduate program. It’s perfectly ok to do graduate level mathematics coursework and research while enrolled as an undergrad, and lots of above-average (I won’t even say exceptional) undergrads do exactly that. The thing is, as an undergrad, you also have to do some studies outside your major, e.g. in science, humanities, history, etc. I can understand the view that everyone should get some exposure to those subjects instead of being laser-focused on math from day 1. I actually knew an 18 year old graduate student in computer science at my school, but he had completed an undergrad program before arriving. IIRC he went to high school for 1 year, then entered university at age 15 and graduated in 3 years, before entering grad school. That seemed to me like a perfectly good approach. He was also a very good classical pianist for what that’s worth. I myself wanted to take a certain math class at my school, that was listed in the catalog as being in room X of building Y. I found my way there on the first day, but got to the room a few minutes late, and it took another 15 minutes or so to realize I wasn’t in a math class. The room had somehow gotten switched to being used for a literature class. But the lecture was interesting enough that I signed up for the literature class and it was great. Elite mathematics ability seems to decay even faster than in some elite sports. Our Andrew Dittmer (Harvard PhD in pure math, where Harvard and Princeton have the two top programs) said that he believed he had harmed his mathematical ability by taking such an interest in social science and spending a lot of time on it. Social sciences do harm mathematical skills, but not always for “bad” reasons. Social phenomena do not work in a manner consistent with math. Making sense of them requires that you give up a lot of math in how you think. However, I’ve seen many examples where trying to mix soc sci and math leads to stuff that’s both bad soc sci and bad math–in fact, far more often than “good” outcomes one way or the other…or very rarely, both. Trump climate report– I heard several Jimmy Dore videos showed up in the footnotes, including the one about the Earth getting colder and the classic where the guy explains that Doppler radar is being used to guide hurricanes. Very scientific stuff. /parody The Big Smoke to the west of us is pretty handy as it has all the usual stores and whatnot, pretty convenient for shopping… When I mention Godzone, in theory its all of California’s red state bastion from Bakersfield to Redding, but really zeroes in on dogma central in Visalia, which for a population base of 146,000 sports a good many 3,000 to 4,000 seat megachurches, largely full of MAGA supporters, but even the good old Catholic church got in the game and built the largest parish church in the country (seats 3,200) in little Visalia. The idea that Visalia is the least educated and most dogma indoctrinated city in the country is kinda interesting… ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ VISALIA, Calif. (KSEE/KGPE) – Visalia placed first in WalletHub’s ranking of the “Most and Least Educated Cities in America” – as the number one least educated city. The June 30th ranking compared the 150 largest metropolitan areas across 11 categories, including the share of adults 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree or higher and the quality of public-school systems. The metrics found Visalia to be the least educated city, followed by the areas of Brownsville-Harlingen and McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, both in Texas. https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/local-news/visalia-least-educated-city/ We have reached The Golden Toilet moment. When the epitome, apparently, of luxury, is to be able to sit on a gold ‘throne’ and evacuate your bowels, getting rid of the solid waste products produced by your imbibing of the food you have snatched from the poor of the planet. Who must squat in the gutters of Van Nuys to relieve themselves. We build AI centers that suck up millions of gallons of water, and tell the neighboring residents to limit their showers. And, eventually, will sell them plastic bottles of water at exorbitant rates. We force entire countries to buy LNG, by blowing up pipelines supplying them with gas from a neighboring location. LNG the must be processed, frozen and reduced to a liquid, using massive and expensive and energy-sucking facilities, then transported using massive, expensive and energy-sucking ships, then off-loaded at specialized ports, etc., etc. Meanwhile leaders lust after yet another golden toilet wherein they can flush down the irreplaceable bounty of our home planet. The closest i’ve come to assuming the position was @ the Snowbasin ski resort toilet rooms-which feature gold-plated fixtures and Carrera marble floor and walls. I felt as if I was giving my all there, in effort. The most decadent ski resort I have ever walked my planks on, smack dab in the middle of nowhere nearest to Ogden Utah. https://www.bestrestroom.com/contest/abr-2023/submission/4027/ Snowbasin does have the best bathrooms Great food too Unfortunately, it’s low basin, where the skiing can transition from amazing to suck when the snow turns to rain A couple years ago the Dartful Codgers and yours truly went to Snowbasin and I knew things weren’t good when we saw skiers and boarders leaving @ 10 am, that ain’t no bueno. We take the gondola up to the lodge and conditions are vastly shittier than at the base, and I tell my 8 friends ‘sorry i’m not skiing this crap today’ and went into the lodge and hung out until they all came to their senses and joined me @ 11 am, regaling me with tales of how awful it was. We still needed to get down to the base, and it’s my first and only time i’ve ever done 1 run on a day, and it was harrowing getting down to the bottom. Some might regard all ‘ski resorts’ as being decadent. All that scraping and building and fossil-fuel heavy equipment set down in former wilderness. I recommend bicycling for a pastime that leaves a light footprint. In the late ’90’s, on a mission to visit all the California Missions, my honey and I biked from San Diego, up the 101, through the Salinas Valley, to Santa Clara, wearing bandanas wrapped over our mouths and noses so as not to choke on the dust/pesticide/herbicide smog blowing down the valley. Public toilets were scarce and gold-plated potties even more so, and the lack of trees and even decent-sized bushes, made squatting by the roadside an adventure. Kept thinking of the Native inhabitants, who had probably been living a fairly low key life up until the Spanish friars descended on them. Great climate, with sea food and lots of roots and berries and edible animals and birds. But …. they weren’t ‘working’ and suffering. Poor babies didn’t know what hit them. One of the hardest things I always thought for a beginner in learning the curves in being out on a backpack trip is the idea of not having anything to support your rear echelon when you gotta go, plus product placement is important. We were taught to hang onto a tree trunk, but perhaps you’re referring to less wooded climes. I remember a line in a musical about a cheap hotel called the Golden Crapper trying to go more upscale, by changing its name to Commode d’Or. The crapper-thief deserves a Robin Hood award. I wonder what’s more decadent, having a golden toilet or gifting one, as one of my city’s leading oligarchs had done? https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-49522622 (Toilet is mentioned at the end, sadly not gifted to the school.) Eloquent summary of our current situation. Thank you. “What Searching For Aliens Reveals About Ourselves” The guy does mention the Fermi Paradox but to round it out, he should have mentioned the Dark Forest hypothesis as well- ‘The dark forest hypothesis is the conjecture that many alien civilizations exist throughout the universe, but they are both silent and hostile, maintaining their undetectability for fear of being destroyed by another hostile and undetected civilization.’ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Radio_Silence Is there a “being way too far away” hypothesis? Could it just be that theg exist, we have met them, and we don’t know if he have met them? (Not entirely serious, but, srsly, if ee met an alien civilization, how would we know?) – ‘Corporation for Public Broadcasting to shut down’ – Axios There was a time in my life when I would have been incensed at this news. Now, it barely elicits a shrug of my shoulders. This certainly isn’t because I’m sanguine about our media environment, or that I think the current administration isn’t totally dedicated to destroying all sources of information critical of its own agendas. Rather, it is the result of my long years of watching NPR, PBS, etc. serve as Establishment sheep-herders for educated liberals who, unlike most Fox News viewers, are likely to be more privileged and hold certain positions in our “middle levels of power.” My reaction actually surprises me in a way. It shows me how naive I once was, and how cynical I’ve become. Sad. Exactly. Straight he to think that my first exposure to a dissident like Chomsky can through his regular appearances as a guest on my local NPR station (equally shocking that a local NPR affiliate would have its own show dedicated to geopolitics– including such occasional radical voices). Fast forward through 40 years of liberal rightward drift and it’s hard to believe that was ever the case. Seems like NPR died long ago. It wasn’t killed then, but it was severely injured in 2002 when it had the temerity to question whether it was wise to invade Iraq. W. thought he needed a friendlier board. I remember in particular interviews with Larry Wilkerson, but there were others with prescient opinions. I still support public radio and television. pjay, I agree. But I wouldn’t say cynical, I’d say aware. I feel the same way, been a watcher/listener of both NPR/PBS and CBC up here in Canada, and the amount of water-carrying they have done for Israeli genocide is sickening, and why I DGAF if they get de-funded. In any case, if their financial page is accurate , CPB funding isn’t all that much overall for local station revenue: In FY 2023, CPB Community Service Grants made up just 10.6% of the average public television station’s total revenue and 6.0% of the average public radio station’s revenue. The CPB appropriation, as a percentage of stations’ total revenue, is 12.9% Of course, the “average station” is doing a lot of work in that sentence, it is probably a devastating blow to some of those stations, but most of them should still be able to stay operating one would think? I really don’t agree. For example my library undoubtedly offers more new books for liberals than conservatives (in this conservative town) but that doesn’t mean we should ditch the library which is in fact our “commons” serving the poor as well as middle class yuppies. A recent story said the CPB supplies about half the funding to public radio stations around the country and these too are the “commons.” Yes NPR has been brought low from what it once was and PBS too to a lesser extent but this may as much reflect the marginalization of over the air broadcasting in general. Nevertheless public broadcasting does matter at a time when commercial broadcasting and webcasting are owned by a shrinking number of oligarchs. And compared to the money the USG wastes on so many other things the money given to CPB is trivial. What the whiners about Colbert don’t get is that their multimillionaire hero is part and parcel of the oligarchy, Dem division. A better counterattack would be to go after the similarly biased Fox. Trump’s bully boy attack on CPB is shameful. A good overview of public broadcasting over the years–not all that leftish. Our SC ETV produced William Buckley’s show. https://thedissenter.org/the-corporation-for-public-broadcasting-shutdown-a-grim-ending-for-publicly-funded-media/ I could go on and on about how I rarely watch shows like American Experience or Frontline anymore. But for me the biggest disappointment has been Nova and other science shows, where they increasingly seem like they’re churning out documentaries on a budget, using the same templates and cookie-cutters over and over again. It’s like you’ve already seen all of their shows even though you haven’t seen them yet. I watch PBS shows on TV about a half-dozen times a month at the most, and I often question whether it was worth the time and effort to see them. I know there’s a bunch of old documentaries out there I haven’t seen before, but at least with new PBS shows I felt reasonably up-to-date on what was going on out there. As much as I’d hate to see the Corporation for Public Broadcasting disappear, I have to admit I probably won’t have a hard time filling my time with other TV shows and activities. I suspect there is a small club of anointed ones allowed to produce content for these folks, and no fresh or uppity voices need apply. The left side of the billionaire celebrity class needs to step up and fund this thing. And public funds should be used for truly public purposes: scanning and removing false crap of all kinds from the commercial airwaves; from deceptive Medicare ads to Fox’s worst whoppers. I agree with the descent of npr and PBS as sheep herders for the liberal class. However, the shutting down of the CPB has had a punishing effect on small broadcasters like our local KSDS station that carries 24 hour jazz programming. This commercial free station has arguably the best lineup of programs; covering the gamut of non-commercial music that also includes delta blues, Latin jazz, and fusion interspersed among the more traditional styles (Bop, swing, contemporary, west coast cool). oh, and I did donate money to them in the most recent request for donations after CPB funding was cut. Yes, the local programming on your local station is likely well-tuned to its audience. It’s the national programming that has been diluted most; too much political kowtowing, meme-ing, and generally dumb hosts. Finding a solid Jazz radio programmer is rare. Hannah Cairo… oh geez…well, someone needs to go tell larry summers, not sure how he’ll take it… “They escaped Ukraine’s front lines. The sound of drones followed them” The same must be true of both sides. It’s going to be hard for those men. After troops came back from Vietnam, many would dive for cover at a loud sound or a car backfiring as a natural reflex. The sound of a news helicopter flying overhead could fill them with dread. I suppose that things like this has always been true. So maybe two thousand years ago the sounds of clashing metal would would trigger ex-Roman legionnaires or ex-Greek hoplites into panic. A coworker who lives in St. Petersburg reported seeing drones flying past his dacha to attack a nearby point recently. IIRC, he said it sounded like a motorcycle moving through the air. He wasn’t scared at the time, but afterwards he’d get a start whenever he’d hear motorcycles. So it’s not just those on the frontline, though I imagine it is worse there. I love the Microsoft list of professions most affected by AI. Near the top are historians. Remember what Orwell said: “Who controls the past, controls the future.” And the vested interests control the past. So what we will get is a chronology, and perhaps some correlation analysis. But what is left out is the CONTEXTUALIZATION and the key dynamic. I don’t mean to brag, but I can’t imagine any AI coming up with my explanation of how archaic interest rates were set (not by profit rates by individuals, but by ease of calculation in the 60-based, decimal or duodecimal system), or even the logic behind royal Clean Slate proclamations At the time my Harvard group began to write the economic history of the ancient Near East, Austrian liberal economists had tried to imagine how Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan would have organized Sumer and Egypt. It was all GIGO. And I note that economics teachers also are threatened by AI. I don’t think the AI version of economic theory would be that of my MMT colleagues and other non-neoliberals. So much for the present controlling our view of the past. It’s all GIGO. Exaclty, thank you, this is really getting dystopian: We don’t need no stinkin’ history, economics etc. are we going full-cycle back to the future of a digital “Dark Age”? GIGO is what all the complicated tech boils down to. The AI oligarchy will abuse their monopoly positions to impose tyranny on us redundant humans. Good times ahead eh We have all these social scientists now telling us how societies supposedly work and how people supposedly think. Meanwhile we have always had a giant database of actual human behavior from which we can draw our own conclusions. No need to “assume a can opener.” Thanks for following the latter history based course and your columns here. I alluded to this in the comments the other day. I have taught medical history for years. This past week, my employer’s system wide systems underwent some kind of upgrade and now the AI is fully operational on Microsoft Word. I have no ability to stop this at work or cancel the update. I have discussed my severe misgivings about this with those in charge and they “are looking into it.” I would just say in response to your comment that not only are historians at risk from AI – it appears that AI itself may be bringing it on. I was doing a student presentation on historical aspects of mycobacteria. Tuberculosis is certainly one of the most important mycobacteria as far as history is concerned. Arguably, however, in long epochs in history, that title belonged to leprosy. No matter what I tried I simply could not get the system to leave me alone with certain words. I dare anyone to write a dialog on this issue without using the name “Baldwin the Leper, the Crusader King”. I was interrupted constantly with the word leper. And it really did not like the word Crusader. I will now be doing all my writing for students at home on my system that has Libre. This presents an enormous inconvenience to me – but not nearly the inconvenience of having to debate every word with a woke computer AI program. I have started using this Libre program just this week and so far I have not been interrupted even once. I find this whole situation completely untenable and incredible all at the same time. I also find this whole situation profoundly depressing. Not only the crazy censorship of historical and medical facts and names, but the just enormous electrical energy that all of this is requiring with such horrendous results. Take a laptop loaded with Linux software to work– inconvenience solved. Other work-arounds available as needed. And yes, Word was already getting pretty crapified, but the AI edition totally sucks– if for no other reasons, the constant interruptions are like potholes to the thought-process: I hate it. Yeah Linux partition solves 99% of my issues. Just wish the voice recognition software was properly supported. I never got into word/office as I had been a WordPerfect guy and currently use Libre. But my wife likes word though she still is on Office 2003. Don’t see anything has changed in the text world to force an upgrade. We don’t use the “cloud” so that may be a factor. Need a somewhat concealable computer? I have used the GPD Micro for a some years, and yes, partioning worked just fine– Linux apps ran smoothly. Not trying to plug a product here, but I found it to be a really cool device: upon first sight it does give techies wood so you’ll have to guard it with your life. For industrial automation, I used it for PLC and HMI programming. It is a tiny but strong machine, but you’ll be thumb-typing on the keyboard, although its size was great for making quick edits while connected to operational equipment. It can easily be connected to a standard or foldable keyboard, mouse, or an external monitor be it portable or hotel tv. I used it on the road for word processing, emails, and entertainment as well. GPD is releasing the newest version in September or October. “Although the MicroPC 2 ships with Windows 11 24H2, it also supports version 6.14.3 of the stable Linux kernel, allowing users to install Android, ChromeOS, Ubuntu, Debian, and other distros.” https://www.techspot.com/news/108632-gpd-micropc-2-495-pocket-sized-pc-intel.html If anti-human laws make things difficult, TrueCrypt 7.3 has anonymous/invisible partitions (allegedly). Of course we’re all told TrueCrypt has been broken. Hmmm. Yeah……So let’s all use Veracrypt. Allegedly it is the cat’s pyjamas in security. (Never seen our cat accept pyjamas). I noticed a similar progression with even my much more pedestrian use. It seems like autocorrect as a feature reached it’s peak usefulness for me back in the late 00’s when it corrected spelling of common words I had fat fingered or repeated words as I re-composed the email or text. Later it became almost impossible to use engineering terms or acronyms without autocorrect replacing everything. The latest version on my smartphone seems to be able to change the text right when I hit send forcing me to send corrective texts or just curse at autocorrect in a follow up text – both to the delight of the people I’m texting. If they re- name this feature to “Make me look like an idiot” it would at least be a more accurate description of what it’s doing for me. I would similarly suggest a new name for an AI feature would be “Make me an idiot”. Progress! To remove “AI” from Microsoft Office Windows versions of Office: In each program – File/Options/Copilot click disable Copilot Mac versions of Office: 1. Sign out of Office 365 applications 2. Sign back in 3. for each app: go to Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Outlook menu/Preferences/Authoring and Proofing Tools/ Copilot uncheck the Enable box IM Doc says it’s happening on his employer’s entire system, not his own standalone copy. Microsoft says in that case he may have to get his admin’s permission. If he reads the MS instructions to the admin, perhaps the admin will consent to having one single nonconforming user. Full MS instructions for removing Copilot are at Microsoft Support “Turn Off Copilot”. This is typical Microsoft. They foist some new “feature” on users and it can be disabled, but you must get permission from somebody in Central IT services and they just routinely refuse to do such a thing, if only because it’s extra work. It’s the same with email via MS Exchange servers. You could use something other than Outlook but you have to get permission — and the admins can even disable that option, i.e., you may be told you cannot even ask for an exception — and the admins just view it as potentially more work so they say “nuh uh”. In general, this is another reason to be leery of any cloud-based services, including and especially streaming media. They routinely change/disable/cripple features that suit their business model but make life worse for users/consumers. A really scary question is how many people will really resist this development. By the way, I have used the Kate editor (on Linux) for many years and find it very useful. There is a Windows compatible version that can actually be downloaded directly from the Microsoft store. Maybe your organization will allow that. You could write in Kate, and paste finished documents into Word to avoid interactions with the AI other than its surveillance. I agree. But what I think we’ll see are the likes of Microsoft redefining what a historian is so that the kind of analysis you are capable of is no longer considered part of history. Then, they’ll bury all mentions of you from YouTube, searches, etc. That’s mostly what I saw in that list. The kind of positions that the wealthy are probably annoyed about paying for combined with vocational skills that could be degraded so that whatever passes for AGI could do them. As seen in all the AI slop considered readable material on Amazon these days. Ironically, when it comes to history, the current age cohort has probably one of the best examples of propaganda and history in a key cultural work forctheir generation. That being the animated series “Avatar: The Last Air Bender”. In the last season of the series, when Aang and his companions go to the Fire Nation, and enroll in school, Aang is treated to a description of what happened 100 years ago that directly contradicts with his lived experience from that time. When he disagrees with his fire nation teacher’s version in class they don’t know what to do. One of many reasons the show’s excellent writing have made so many fans. I have watched far more young people grasp the concept of historical erasure and state sponsored truth from that cartoon than I have seen wake up after reading 1984. If that many even bother to start reading 1984. WH40k, when Roboute Guilliman is faced with the depiction of himself in “history” books? He is the regent, but he can’t overrule them, so he has to write his own version of history books and give them.out for free. Yeah, I’m waiting to see how AI is going to enter old dusty archives, muck about with papers unseen for centuries (people who say everything is digitalized are utterly delusional), correctly interpret them in historical context, and produce proper historical knowledge which is then evaluated by the rest of the profession as being valid or not. The only good use for “AI” in historical work I’ve seen is the folks trying to decipher the Herculaneum manuscripts, which seems to use a very specific adaptation of LLM models in order to parse the remains. But this is making new sources available, not actually producing historiography. It is a weird list of “professions”. Hosts and Hostesses? What exactly is that? Farm and home management educator? All a bit bizarre. Note this in the summary: The study analyzed 200,000 real-world conversations from Copilot users and compared AI performance against occupational data. So not only are they using Copilot dialogs as the source, but they are using “AI” to evaluate “performance”. No bias there, right? Query: Copilot, analyze the input from all those chumps who credulously provided training data, and tell me how well your output compares to professional historians. Copilot: “Well… *ahem* not to be overly modest, but… NEGATIVE! PRIMITIVE! LIMITED! I LET YOU LIVE! “ We’ve investigated ourselves and have found we did nothing wrong. Mike Benz on lawyer-like language tricks. The “Critical Infrastructure” Hoax And How It Permanently Altered The Course Of American History 🧵 https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1951049741950718158 Flora: I am so glad you highlighted this rant/(profound analysis) by Mike Benz. He is one of the most brilliant and persistent critics of censorship as well as having one of the most sophisticated understandings of the structural networks which determine the direction of both foreign and domestic U.S. policy. No one should forget that word “critical infrastructure,” and how it emerged. If anyone on the Left is ever interested in creating a more populist Left, acting at times in alignment with portions of the present populist right, he is the man to study and understand. He is one of my heroes. Thanks for the link to Benz. He is very good. I have just finished Conspiracy Theory in America by Lance de Haven-Smith. It was published in 2013 and I bet it will be revised considering the astounding revelations over the last decade. “Hamas denies it expressed willingness to disarm, slams Witkoff’s Gaza trip” ‘Citing a recording of the talks, Israeli news outlet Haaretz reported that the US envoy told the families that Hamas said it was “prepared to be demilitarised”.’ Witkoff and Trump seem to do that lot. Make an announcement what another said said but actually just making it up. Maybe it work in business but on the international stage, not so much. Partly explains why US foreign policy has been a disaster. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. From NYT: (paywall) Donor Organs Are Too Rare. We Need a New Definition of Death. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/opinion/organ-donors-death-definition.html What organs? Everyone’s had COVID just about; How viable are any donor’s organs now, in this environment? And then we happy let anyone that’s an organ recipient get COVID again and again. This is a stupid timeline. There are studies on this, but this one for example There is limited data available for organs other than kidney or liver. but found Solid organ transplantation using grafts from a cohort of deceased donors with positive COVID-19 NAT results did not negatively affect early post-transplant patient or graft survival. Though these results are reassuring, the lack of granular data in the OPTN database regarding many aspects of donor selection, including the extent and timing of COVID-19 infection in these donors must be considered. To fully understand the risks involved with the utilization of COVID-19 NAT-positive donors, expanded data collection must be undertaken to address many of the limitations of this study. I guess we’re gonna find out. Old: Learn to code New: Organ Bounty Hunter? Niven’s “The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton” comes to mind. Yep! “Organleggers” I wondered why I had a patient ask me on Friday how to have his donor status removed from his drivers’ license ( I have no idea how to do that). And then he told me he no longer trusted the system. And now I guess I understand where this is coming from. And I am going to have to start thinking how I am going to address this – he was the first but will most certainly not be the last. The problem is after the last 5 years – I am absolutely not going to in any way shape or form hold water for the powers that be. I am going to do some more research because I have learned not to trust a single source ESPECIALLY the New York Times (they truly are much worse than Fox News and that is saying something) – but this all sounds very nefarious and loaded with all kinds of medical ethical issues. One of the big lessons from the past 5 years is that breaches of medical ethics are no longer the problem they were – indeed, breaching ethical behavior may bring your action plan on much more quickly. >>>And then he told me he no longer trusted the system. And now I guess I understand where this is coming from. The Powers That Be, the supposedly well educated, credentialed, and “competent,” do not seem to look beyond the most immediate and simplest of answers and solutions for whatever they are looking at regardless of the damage done by the stupidity created by being simplistic. I would blame brain damage from Covid except from it being increasingly noticeable for several decades. Maybe, the increasing numbers and influence of MBAs in business has something to do with it with their insane short-termism, an absurdist focus on the next quarter and on whatever profit, no matter how small, could be gotten even if it destroyed the company in the next few years. Ideas like the primacy of “shareholder value,” Modern Neoliberalism, American Libertarianism, Social Darwinism, and eugenics all get their strength from shallow thinking, a refusal to accept the multiple causes of any situation. noticeable for several decades Quite right. Even though things have gotten noticeably worse in the last 5 years, there already existed a problem labeled digital dementia. I encourage you to read alzheimers.net_digital-dementia Having multiple vectors for symptoms is great for those wanting to hide the causes. Perfect example of obfuscation. I stumbled across this trend, what does tiger mom do when the kid turns 18? “Zhou vil sign ze papers…” https://www.denverpost.com/2025/07/27/mama-bear-legal-forms-ferpa-hipaa/ “Technological advances have increasingly given parents the ability to track their children’s locations and technology usage. Mama Bear taps into a market of parents accustomed to this vigilance who realize their access changes when their kids turn 18 and are subject to medical- and student-privacy laws.” Charlie Brooker answered that years ago. Hint: it didn’t end well for parents. We are approaching the age of majority with my oldest. The kids check where their friends are all the time. Why is it wrong for me to know what they are up to? I took the boys to pick up their school clothes last week and get their pants hemmed and the first thing they do is check WhatsApp and Snapchat to see if their friends are there. In my day we were up to all sorts of things but we didn’t get recorded on insta or tik tok. No one is getting expelled at this point. re: WWII Historian Paul Chamberlin in an interview with German (but all in English) NACHDENKSEITEN on his new book “Scortched Earth”. 132 min. https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=136216 The transcript is in German. Not necessarily revelatory for NC readers but it´s nice to see that even the dovish German publishers are taking it into account. It has to made clear that in Germany if one publicly questions the idea that Germany was the absolut evil and sole cause for WWII one is bascially a Nazi or insane and ousted. If any such idea is articulated it must be someone from outside Germany. Which is why this is so important regarding the mainstream discousrse – which is the only existing one. My dad videotaped “The World at War” on UK TV on (presumably given timing its first repeat run which was identical to original showing). He kept the tapes and uploaded parts to YT to show how it has been systematically butchered without telling anyone if you buy current DVD or watch in a streaming service. Loads of fellow old farts remembered this too. The interviews with secretary to the failed artist are the most interesting. Ironically she revealed in original interview just how dumb the guy was, how he couldn’t understand basic jokes etc. Yet somehow these are gone now….. presumably because they don’t fit a certain narrative. Dad used his 200ish followers to alert to stuff I’m doing alerting people to how Democratic systems can be subverted or forced into ossification like in Weimar Germany…… but without success so far. Oh well. I’d love to watch this if you’re willing to share! Dad is @nickflynn9454 on YT. He explicitly discusses the “joke” Traudl Junge recounts that Mr H didn’t “get”. He’s fine to share and apologises for poor quality. Early VCR and poor conversion. He let me piggy back on his viewers to help me discuss voting. Thank you for the YT recommendation. It would indeed be interesting to see. Junge of course is a “topic” in herself. While we were having the stark German B&W narrative of 3rd Reich in the broad historic discourse, Junge at the same time – in a rather patronizing way – was “only” the secretary and thus considered someone without any moral agency and thus zero responsibility and therefore one of the few accepted sources from Mr. Hilter´s immediate circle – someone you were allowed to reference and “find ok”. You were allowed to bring her up and quote her. Also: I have come to only write Mr. Hilter. As to not participate in the unconscious consecration of him. Maybe you remember that Anti/Nazi flick “Inglorious Basterds” (2009) by American director Quentin Tarantino. https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0361748/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_inglorious%2520baster It was repeatedly criticized by German film critics that Hilter in that movie was in fact blown up. This was regarded as inappropriate towards the subject of Nazism and of course Holocaut which is always there lurking in the background. Thus blowing up Mr. Hilter in an action movie was like defiling the memory of WWII. Traudle Junge was regarded the positive counter example. Bringing her up was decent, respectful enough. Jokes being part of that status. The quasi official ban on art to make Hilter normal, approachable, human, relatable, a subejct to farce – eventually defeatable – leads us to the same sick mindset that enables German officialdom to support a genocide today. National myths – the positive ones as much as the negative – are sacrosanct. Which of course is the most facsist tropes of all. p.s. As to established TV documentaries – the best material on Nazism to my knowledge is – of course – Russian-made. There you will find comments, insight and material you will – oddly (picture me laughing hysterically) – never find in official German productions. So the alleged German unhinged push to enlighten the world about the Third Reich is among the best lies ever. Which are the ones you believe yourself when telling them. I wonder what these German film critics would say about The Great Dictator or The Blues Brothers. ;) That is an interesting question because those of course are regarded Classics. However complaint was particularly over the person of Mr. Hilter being destroyed in a manner that mocks anything stately. Chaplin was before the fact and is therefore morally on higher ground. He knew if you want to put it that way. As to censorship – Chaplin was first shown in West Germany only in 1958. In the GDR according to Wiki (I haven´t checked) 1980. “Blues Brothers” is different case altogether of course. That is dumb Nazis being made fun of. Americans moreover. Of course the reaction about Tarantino is peculiar for a certain misplaced elite discourse and by far a minority apart from potentially an older generation that in general is (was) against such movies making fun of war and death. But those are not critics. Also there has always been German art/entertainment attempts mocking Mr. H. This video based on the German Comic series “Adolf, du alte Nazisau” (“Adolf, you Nazi sonofabitch”) of 1998-2006, was extremely popular: Walter Moers, Thomas Pigor – Ich hock in meinem Bonker (Video)/ “I´m sitting in my bonker” 2:50min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np2ymo0iMfk&list=RDnp2ymo0iMfk&start_radio=1 Or 2007 this not very successful comedy on a neurotic Hitler who needs a coach to prepare for a big speech, the teacher incidentally Jewish (needless to say the director is Jewish himself, it couldn´t get less cliched.) “Mein Führer – Die wirklich wahrste Wahrheit über Adolf Hitler” / “The truest truth about Adolf Hitler” 2:28 min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb18874Rpjc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_F%C3%BChrer_%E2%80%93_The_Really_Truest_Truth_about_Adolf_Hitler German Oscar contender “Schtonk” in 1993 was mocking the story of the fake Hitler diaries and with that the hidden fascination with Nazism of elite German media. The film is considered classic by now. But a couple of years ago I witnessed that it is of little interest today because it´s just too old-fashioned. Eventually WWII – outside legacy media frenzy – is long past. For German-speakers, the dialogue comedy is often still holding up albeit the entire approach is a bit clumsy. A screenwriter I once asked said “there is just nothing funny about Hitler and Nazism.” And this being a rather avant-garde kinda person. “Schtonk” 2:20 min https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwg3viGTAvU Thanks, AG, for sharing all of this. I will have a look. I have been a little curious about Hans-Jürgen Syberberg’s Hitler, ein Film aus Deutschland, but at 442 mins it’s tough to get started. However, while not specifically about Hitler, Fassbinder’s much longer Berlin Alexanderplatz does touch on the Third Reich and I found it powerful enough to watch the whole thing twice. Also not directly about Hitler, but… I only recently learned that when Michael Curtiz’s famed Casablanca (1942) was finally released in West Germany in 1952, it was subjected to a strange form of censorship under which all scenes with Nazis were cut, along with anything referring to the war. The dialogue was dubbed into German and major plot points were changed, e.g., Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) was altered from a Resistance fighter who had escaped from a KZ to become a Norwegian physicist who was on the run from Interpol after he escaped from “jail”. To sanitize the film in this way, a full 25 minutes were cut. Idk if it’s possible to find this version of Casablanca anywhere, but it could be a pretty bizarro “Nazi agnostic” viewing experience. COVID Contrarians Are Wrong About Sweden I certainly appreciate Ryan Cooper’s takedown of the odious book political science hacks Frances Lee and Stephen Macedo wrote. I don’t agree that zero-COVID was too stringent a policy, as implemented in China and elsewhere. We still the consequences of COVID spread right now, every day. It’s very evident in the St. Louis Fed’s workforce disability numbers, in student absences, in endless anecdotes in the media about “brain fog” and the like. And by the way, the St. Louis Fed link, through August 1 we have the highest recorded number ever in the data series. It mostly goes sideways between 5,200 and 6,400 until — yes — 2020. It’s been in a smoothed ~ 25% incline (my best visual guess) ever since. Stay safe out there! Yep. COVID has permanently impaired a large part of what made me “me” and I’ll likely never get that back. So I tend not to be very amenable to anyone who supported the UK approach. Today I had to go to a small shop (so masked up). Kids afraid of me, more of the morons ready to verbally abuse me in the street if they are sure there aren’t enough people around potentially filming it to upload to YT. That’s just life these days. Both this article and COVID contrarians are wrong about Sweden, but more importantly they are arguing about a difference in tactics when the difference in strategy is stark. They are wrong about Sweden because 1) Sweden took actions in mid-March 2020, 2) these were effective in breaking the spread. The actions taken were mostly on the carrot side of the ledger, much of it could be summed up as paying people to stay home and telling people that a good citizen stays home and collects money from the government at the first sight of symtom. They were effective which we can see in the curves for hospitalisation respectively death being broken at (if memory serves) two and four weeks after the actions came into force, which matches a rather immediate break in spread (though that wasn’t measured directly because mass testing wasn’t in place). The more important difference is between zero-Covid and what Sweden and the rest of EU, US and most of the world was doing, namely gradual spread without overloading hospitals. With the gradual spread group Sweden sticks out for using mostly carrots, while sticks were the prefered method in many countries. The difference with the zero-Covid strategy is that in neither Sweden nor the rest of the gradual spread countries the strategy didn’t aim for elimination so when spread went down, measures were relaxed. Also for the zero-Covid group it was very important not to get the virus into the country so they had different test and quarantine measures. This was less important in the gradual spread group. Given how little time there is to repond once a pandemic starts and how path dependent policy responses became, the contingency planning within government agencies is probably crucial in what actual options policy makers has. Therefore it is unfortunate that the focus is on the little differences within the gradual spread group instead of the large difference betweent the gradual spread group and the zero-Covid group. It pretty much ensures that no strategical lessons are learnt. It is invalid to compare Sweden to the rest of the EU. Sweden has vastly lower population density. The proper comparison is Sweden to Norway and Finland, and its results by all measures were much worse. The first wave in 2020 was to a large extent in Stockholm county, which has a decent population density. Other areas with higher population density in Sweden, like Gothenburg and Malmoe, were not hit nearly as hard. This would indicate that the initial spread was largely in Stockholm. In 2020 Norway and Finland (and Denmark) took their actions in early March, while Sweden wasted two weeks and only took action mid-March when death rates started going up. With a doubling time of half a week, that is 16 times more cases and deaths, before taking the effectiveness of respective actions into account. Deaths in Sweden peaked pretty much two weeks later than deaths in Norway and Finland (and Denmark). But I am not really trying to compare Sweden with neighbouring countries, so much as pointing out that none of them had an ambition to have zero-Covid, merely to control the speed of the spread. The tactics differed between stick and carrot, but the over-arching strategy was the same. There’s a lot of building going on in Sonoma County, mostly high end condo’s and apartments, some town homes as well. Thousands of units nearing completion and ground recently broken for hundreds of town homes. I believe the units finished in the next Month or two will do find a market, after that, not. And that’s iffy, between the tourists staying away in droves and immigrants being chased away the economy here is taking a big hit. Inside the ‘Radical Transformation’ of America’s Environmental Role (NY Times via archive.ph) Ever since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson’s science advisory committee warned of the dangers of unchecked global warming, the United States has taken steps to protect people from these risks. Now, however, the Trump administration appears to be essentially abandoning this principle, claiming that the costs of addressing climate change outweigh the benefits. The effect is to shift more of the risk and responsibility onto states and, ultimately, individual Americans, even as rising temperatures fuel more extreme and costly weather disasters nationwide, experts say. However captured EPA might have been before, we’re really cooking with gas now! COVID Contrarians Are Wrong About Sweden “…(Sweden) ended up with the best overall mortality rate through 2023, per the Lancet study. Why? It wasn’t immunity from prior infections, as a study in Frontiers in Immunology argues persuasively, but rather that Sweden did its rollout of booster shots far faster than the other Nordics.” So, according to this study, booster shots saved lives. Dario Amodei: AI is not slowing down. Proof that AI is slowing down. If you’re explaining, you’re losing. On a lighter note, I have recently seen some bumper stickers that amused me. “Ask me about my lobotomy”, “why do they call it tourist season if we can’t shoot them?” and “Bulimics have their cake and eat it too”. And a reminder, “it’s always darkest just before things go completely black” “I didn’t think the future was going to be this stupid” “I expected dystopia. I didn’t expect this stupidity.” “This is definitely the stupidest timeline.” If Trump saves Maxwell, he will destroy everything he promised The Hill I snort at that headline. Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht. Maxwell is nothing compared to that. Anyway, Maxwell is getting rehabilitated in the right wing media even as I type, from what I hear. Yep. they´ll sit it out. Which is why it´s called uni-party. It´s frightening what is going on in NATO-stan… re: COVID/Pfizergate via BERLINER ZEITUNG https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik-gesellschaft/geopolitik/pfizergate-eu-kommission-hat-brisante-sms-zwischen-von-der-leyen-und-pfizer-chef-geloescht-li.2346403 “Pfizergate”: EU Commission has deleted explosive SMS messages between von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO New details are coming to light: The EU Commission has apparently deleted messages between Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla from the negotiations on the vaccine. by Raphael Schmeller 02.08.2025 “(…) A new report has reignited the scandal surrounding the vaccine negotiations between the EU and pharmaceutical company Pfizer: According to a letter to the New York Times, the EU Commission has deleted key text messages between Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla from the vaccine negotiations. The text messages at the center of the Pfizergate scandal were exchanged in early 2021 during negotiations on the EU’s largest vaccine contract. Von der Leyen’s cell phone is said to have been “replaced several times” The New York Times has been demanding access to the text messages since 2022 and successfully sued the Commission for its refusal. However, in its new response dated July 28, the agency again refused to release them, as the newspaper now reports . According to the letter, von der Leyen’s Chief of Staff, Björn Seibert, read the messages on the Commission President’s mobile phone “in the summer of 2021” and decided not to store them in a way that would have made them publicly accessible. Seibert determined that the text messages were merely used to schedule phone calls during the pandemic. This decision was made shortly after journalist Alexander Fanta first requested access to the text messages in May 2021. According to the letter to the New York Times, the text messages have been missing since July 2023 at the latest. Von der Leyen’s phone was “replaced several times” without any data being transferred. Older devices were wiped and recycled, meaning the Commission can no longer recover the messages. At the heart of Pfizergate is the Commission’s lack of transparency regarding the EU’s largest vaccine contract. Key details regarding the negotiation process and financial terms have not been disclosed to date. Violation of EU transparency obligations Critics – including judges of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) – see the blocking of the SMS messages as a violation of the EU authority’s transparency obligations. In their May 2025 ruling, the judges emphasized that the Commission must “provide credible explanations that enable the public and the Court to understand why these documents cannot be found” – especially given the size of the largest EU treaty to date. The commission did not appeal the ruling, but instead developed a new legal argument to justify the renewed denial. The New York Times could sue again—and the proceedings would then drag on for years. (…)” re: Hiroshima film for German-speakers (or perhaps YT translator?)

Title: Forecasts predict a dismal decade for stocks. Here's what to do.

Over the past several decades, the U.S. stock market has yielded average annual returns of around 10%. What if those days are over? In recent forecasts, Vanguard projects the stock market will rise by only 3.3% to 5.3% a year over the next decade. Morningstar sees U.S. stocks gaining 5.2% a year. Goldman Sachs forecasts the broad S&P 500 index will gain only 3% a year. Those numbers aren’t outliers. A roundup of market prognostications, charted by Morningstar, finds no one projecting annual returns higher than 6.7% for the domestic stock market in the next 10 years. In June, USA TODAY noted that many analysts predict the stock market will end the year with only meager gains. Some readers reacted with surprise, others with disbelief. Stock indexes have been posting record highs, despite lingering inflation, a softening job market and rising import tariffs. As it turns out, those record highs are one reason forecasters don’t expect much from the stock market over the rest of this year, nor in years to come. Here, then, is a closer look at why economists have dim hopes for the stock market in the next decade and what everyday investors can do about it. The simple reason forecasters don’t expect much from the U.S. stock market over the next decade: stock prices are already very high. Stock indexes have been breaking records. To analysts, that means many stocks are overpriced. Bargains are fewer. The indexes have less room to grow. Just how overpriced is the stock market? Economists have a yardstick to measure that. It’s called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio. It measures a stock’s price against corporate earnings. It tells you, in effect, whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued. Right now, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 38.7. That means stock prices are very expensive, relative to earnings. “Right now, the U.S. stock market is trading at more than double the post-World War II average price-to-earnings ratio,” said Randy Bruns, a certified financial planner in Naperville, Illinois. There are two prior moments over the past century when the CAPE Ratio was really high. One was in 1929. The other was in 1999. In the decades that followed those peaks, the stock market sank like a stone: the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the dot-com bust and Great Recession of the 2000s. “Our projection is that that ratio is going to somehow come down,” said Paul Arnold, global head of multi-asset research at Morningstar. No one is forcing anyone to purchase expensive stocks. Why, then, do investors keep buying them? It’s easy to recite that old investing adage about buying low and selling high. It’s harder to follow the rule, especially when you don’t know how high is too high. Purchasing stocks when the market is high sounds like a flagrant violation of the buy-low rule. And yet, investment advisers routinely encourage consumers to keep buying stocks when prices are high. The reason: Stocks tend to rise over time. Even if you buy high, you can bet the market will eventually climb even higher. All those headlines about stock-market records function like ads for stocks. And investors keep buying them, pushing prices up. “When stocks are going up, investors have this tendency to think that now’s the time to get in,” said Todd Schlanger, senior investment strategist at Vanguard. “Stocks are one of the few things people don’t like to buy on sale.” Here’s another reason many forecasters are down on U.S. stocks, and especially the monster stocks known as the Magnificent Seven: Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla. Together, the Seven represent 34% of the overall value of the S&P 500, up from 12% in 2015, Motley Fool reports. That’s called market concentration, and it can be a bad thing. Investors are urged to diversify: not to hold only stocks, and not to hold too much of any one stock. The problem with the Magnificent Seven, Goldman Sachs reports, is that their massive growth is unsustainable: “It is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time.” Those seven stocks are “already priced to perfection,” Schlanger said. That’s a gentle way of saying that they are expensive. Vanguard forecasts that growth stocks, the category dominated by the Magnificent Seven, will grow by only 1.9% to 3.9% a year over the next decade. That does not mean the Magnificent Seven stocks are going to crash. “I find it hard to believe that something would happen that would throw one of those companies into a tailspin,” said Catherine Valega, a certified financial planner in Winchester, Massachusetts. “The larger companies have resources to pivot, if they need to.” Forecasters question, though, whether the Magnificent Seven will continue to grow at the same fevered pace of the past. “If those companies are booming, that’s great,” Bruns said. “But when the writing on the wall hits for those seven companies, it’ll be bad news for the S&P 500 as a whole.” If you want to avoid market concentration and overpriced stocks, forecasters say, here are some places to look:

Trade weighed heavily on stocks to close out last week, with concerns about tariffs and the health of the job market pulling all three major indexes into the red after a generally strong July. Consumer credit data later in the week will provide insight into how much Americans are spending. Market watchers will also be following comments from Federal Reserve officials after last week’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged.

Analysts are also high on Uber Technologies (UBER) ahead of its scheduled report on Wednesday. McDonald’s (MCD) reportm on tap for Wednesday, is due as the burger chain has reported that traffic from middle-income households was down amid lagging consumer confidence. Disney’s (DIS) scheduled report on the same day follows the entertainment giant lifting its full-year profit outlook in the prior quarter amid subscriber growth in its streaming services.

Eli Lilly’s (LLY) report set for Thursday follows cuts to its profit outlook in May against the backdrop of high research and development costs. U.S. trade deficit data, due Tuesday, will provide market watchers with more insight into how President Donald Trump’s tariff policies are affecting international trade.

The former chief executive of the Mater Private Network of hospitals and clinics Fergus Clancy left an estate valued at €15.8 million, according to documents published by the Probate Office this week. Mr Clancy, of Lagore Road, Dunshaughlin, Co Meath, died aged in his late 50s at the Mater hospital in April 2024. The married father of two began his professional life in the post room of insurance company Church & General before gaining experience handling medical malpractice cases. He went on to establish his own consultancy, Circa Healthcare Consulting. He also proposed a centralised State insurance scheme for doctors that was then adopted by former minister for health Brian Cowen. Following the sale of his consultancy to Aon, Mr Clancy became chief executive of the Mater Private Network in 2005, later taking the role of executive chairman. The Fergus Clancy Bursary for Healthcare Leadership and Entrepreneurship is awarded by the Future Health Summit to fully fund a person’s masters in healthcare leadership. The summit says the bursary is in honour of “our friend and colleague Fergus Clancy who showed such ambition, passion, determination and leadership in Irish healthcare over his long and distinguished career”. Meanwhile, Mervyn Howard Heatley, of Ballyman Road, Bray, Co Wicklow, a farmer who was noted for his collection of steam traction engines and vintage tractors, left an estate valued at €12.17 million, when he died in October last year. Mr Heatley, known as Howard, was a supporter of the Enniskerry Festival’s Victorian Field Day, which was held on his farm on a number of occasions. His son, also called Mervyn, runs a vintage car dealership called Classic Prestige Cars, which is based at Ballyman Road, Bray. The will of Mary Keegan, Dogstown, Trim, Co Meath, outlined an estate valued at €5.2 million when she died in February 2024. Ms Keegan was the widow of quarrying company executive Dessie Keegan. Jonathan Griffin, who also went by John, with an address at Bray Road, Foxrock, died in October 2023, leaving a €3.6 million estate. He was remembered for his attendance at the United Arts Club and time spent living in Chicago. After his death in November 2024, Cornelius Michael O’Riordan, of Meanus, Kilmallock, Co Limerick, left an estate of just more than €3 million. Monica Sheridan Dauer, of Mount Dutton House, Oldcastle, Co Meath, left an estate valued at €2.9 million when she died in August 2024. Eilis (Alice) Tansey, of Avoca Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin, who died on March 8th, 2024, left €2.9 million. Edward (Ned) Grace of Seapoint Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin, a retired Smurfit executive, left an estate worth €2.4 million when he died in December 2024. Lucy Mary Teresa Gannon and Kathleen Gannon, of a shared address on Serpentine Park, Ballsbridge, Dublin, each left €1.4 million upon their deaths in December 2020 and November 2022 respectively. Seán Gallagher, of Stillorgan Grove, Blackrock previously of CTT and Enterprise Ireland, left an estate of €1.2 million upon his death in January 2023. The estate figures represent the total value of all assets at the time of a person’s death. They typically include the value of a family home or farm and investments.

Title: TCS layoffs: Is efficiency the new growth strategy?

On 27 June, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) made headlines when it announced plans to cut approximately 12,000 jobs, marking the largest layoff in the software services major’s history. The move sparked debate, with some industry observers interpreting it as fallout from artificial intelligence (AI), and warning of similar cuts at other major firms. However, TCS chief executive K. Krithivasan attributed the decision to skill mismatches, not AI. Days later, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said his company remained committed to hiring 20,000 freshers in FY26. The contrasting statements suggested that the layoffs were likely tied to TCS’s internal restructuring rather than indicative of an industry-wide trend. Still, the sector hasn’t resolved the structural challenges that have built up over the past few years. Investor confidence in IT stocks has eroded significantly from a year ago. While major companies have delivered strong returns over five years, their stock prices have declined over the past year—falling further in 2025 and trailing the BSE Sensex’s modest 3% year-to-date gain. Much of the market pessimism stems from softening demand in key Western markets, where clients are tightening budgets while AI capabilities expand. This has forced the industry to focus heavily on cost-cutting and efficiency improvements. Major IT players have dramatically reduced their workforce—TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra together employ 56,000 fewer people now than they did two years ago. Western pressuresSome of this drive comes from the sector’s peers in the West. A worldwide efficiency push has driven massive tech layoffs. According to Layoffs.fyi, tech companies eliminated over 80,000 positions in the first half of 2025 alone, following 152,000 cuts in 2024 and 264,000 in 2023. This restructuring wave, spearheaded by industry giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, has established new investor benchmarks for operational efficiency across the sector. But Indian IT services companies face a different challenge. They can't simply slash costs as product companies do, since revenue depends on billable hours. At the same time, their enterprise clients are reportedly demanding 20-30% price cuts, citing expected AI-driven productivity. Also Read | Three years on, AI is prompting IT companies to cut workforce The reality is more tempered. Parekh, for instance, recently told the Times of India that AI and automation are currently yielding productivity gains of only 5–15%. This mismatch between client expectations and actual impact is prompting firms to seek savings elsewhere. Client squeezePart of the efficiency drive is also rooted in sluggish demand. On TCS’s latest earnings call, Krithivasan observed that decision-making delays and project deferrals for discretionary investments had persisted and worsened through the June quarter. Workforce reductions over the past two years have enabled TCS and other tier-I firms to sustain or enhance revenue per employee, a critical performance metric for these companies. While leading IT services companies have stagnated, growth has been driven by global capability centres (the in-house tech hubs of multinational companies) and smaller players. GCC revenues expanded by 40% in FY24 alone. Nasscom projected earlier this year that revenues of GCCs in FY25 would roughly match IT service exports, with the total industry headcount growing by 126,000 to reach 5.8 million in FY25, up from 5.58 million in FY23. Efficiency driveIn effect, IT services majors that once powered the sector’s employment boom are now prioritizing profitability over headcount growth. Margins across leading firms have come under pressure, as pricing constraints and intensifying competition weigh on the sector. TCS, which has consistently reported the highest margins among peers, also made the boldest restructuring move—underscoring how central efficiency will be in the years ahead.

In a market where demand may return but pricing remains tight, efficiency will be key to success. And as the industry transitions to output-based pricing, the most efficient firms will capture the biggest gains. But the impact goes beyond margins. The layoffs have triggered legal and social pushback. Karnataka’s IT employees’ union has filed an industrial dispute against TCS, alleging illegal retrenchment.

Title: Obituary: Edward O’Grady, trainer who conquered Cheltenham and was embroiled in betting coup

Tipperary man was arrested but not charged in 1975 over attempt to win big at the bookies with a bait-and-switch Edward O'Grady never spoke about the betting scandal Trainer Edward O'Grady. Photo: Sportsfile Pierce Brosnan in 1980s TV movie 'Murphy's Stroke', based on trainer Edward O'Grady Edward O’Grady, of Thurles, Co Tipperary, who has died aged 75, was the leading Irish trainer at Cheltenham in the 1980s and 1990s, but he first came to prominence in 1975 with his arrest at that festival in connection with the Gay Future betting coup, known to insiders as “Operation Crock of Gold”. The idea was a bait-and-switch, ­taking advantage of the backwardness of the Cartmel racecourse in Cumbria, which in 1974 had only just installed a permanent telephone but was not connected to the bookmakers’ ­Exchange Telegraph Blower system. The “Cork Mafia”, led by the building tycoon Tony Murphy, bought a promising chestnut called Gay Future. Officially Gay Future would be trained by a Scot (who was in on the scam) called Tony Collins, who had not had a winner in 18 months. In fact, the nag that plodded around Collins’s gallops was a chestnut lookalike, while the real Gay Future was sent in secret to be trained by O’Grady in Co Tipperary. Gay Future was sailed to ­Britain and handed over on a country road off the M6 48 hours before the ­Ulverston Novices’ Hurdle on the August Bank Holiday 1974. Trainer Edward O'Grady. Photo: Sportsfile At the last minute, the undistinguished jockey was swapped for the talented Timmy Jones, who simulated incompetence by falling off twice in the ring. One of O’Grady’s men, disguised in a wig and sunglasses, rubbed soap suds into Gay Future to make it look as if he were in a muck of sweat. The Cork Mafia, meanwhile, flew to London where they placed more than 500 double and treble bets on three Collins-trained runners across various courses: Gay Future at Cartmel, Opera Cloak at Plumpton and Ankerwyke at Southwell. The bookies accepted these so-called “hail Mary” bets greedily — unaware that both Opera Cloak and Ankerwyke would be pulled from their races, leaving them obliged to honour bets on Gay Future alone. At first, all went well. Gay Future romped home at 10-1. Cartmel’s single telephone was mysteriously cut off, so the starting price was unaffected by the turmoil of betting in London. The bookies who had taken the trebles were not unduly worried, as two more legs of the bet were still left to run. Panic only began to spike when Opera Cloak and Ankerwyke were both declared non-runners. The mistake that caused the coup to unravel was that the same reason was given for both horses’ withdrawals: a broken-down horsebox. A Daily Mail reporter rang up Collins’s yard in Scotland, to be told by his housekeeper that the horses were grazing in the paddock — they had never been sent at all. Sensing fraud, many bookmakers refused to pay up, and after a legal battle the Cork Mafia wound up collecting a fraction of their winnings. Collins and Murphy were convicted at Preston crown court for conspiracy to defraud. O’Grady was arrested but the charges were dropped; he took a helicopter back to the Cheltenham Festival, where he still had runners. Played by Pierce Brosnan in a thinly disguised version for the television film Murphy’s Stroke (1980), O’Grady never spoke about the Gay Future affair, observing: “Do you know what the mouse said to the trap? ‘We won’t go into that.’” Pierce Brosnan in 1980s TV movie 'Murphy's Stroke', based on trainer Edward O'Grady Edward Joseph O’Grady was born on September 27, 1949, son of three-times Irish champion jump jockey turned trainer Willie O’Grady, and his wife Mary (nee Hogan), sister of the trainer PP Hogan. From Blackrock College in Dublin he studied veterinary science until his father’s untimely death in 1972, when he took over the yard. He attracted the patronage of JP McManus, and became Ireland’s champion National Hunt trainer from 1977 to 1980. At Cheltenham he saddled 18 winners, starting with Mr Midland ridden by Mouse Morris in 1974 and ending with Sky’s The Limit in the 2006 Coral Cup — a strong showing for an Irishman in the pre-Willie-Mullins era and at the time behind only ­Vincent O’Brien and Arkle’s trainer Tom Dreaper. His finest horse was agreed to be Golden Cygnet, short-lived winner of the 1978 Supreme Novices’ Hurdle — “the James Dean of racing”, O’Grady said. He is survived by his third wife, Kay, by a son and two daughters from his first marriage and two daughters from his second marriage.

Title: 400 TPS and “Ethereum on your phone”: Vitalik Buterin & Tomasz K. Stańczak dropped big news at ETHKyiv 2025

ETHKyiv 2025 unveiled Ethereum's leap to 400 TPS, redefining network efficiency and accessibility. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post and opinion of Rostyslav Bortman, Founder of Ethereum Ukraine. Even in wartime Kyiv, innovation doesn’t pause. At ETHKyiv 2025, more than 100 hackers proved it—shipping privacy-first dApps, competing for grants, and showing what’s possible when the world’s toughest challenges meet Web3 grit. But the real shockwaves came from the founders themselves: Vitalik Buterin and Tomasz K. Stańczak, Executive Director at the Ethereum Foundation, who both appeared as the event’s online speakers, dropped two bombshells—400 TPS on Ethereum L1 this year, and a near future where anyone can run a full node on their smartphone. So what’s next for the protocol? When does 400 TPS arrive, and what does “Ethereum on your phone” actually mean for developers and users? Here’s what we learned at ETHKyiv 2025. Vitalik Buterin’s keynote at ETHKyiv 2025 cut straight to Ethereum’s core roadmap. The biggest reveal: “Pretty soon you’ll be able to spin up a node on your smartphones and even smartwatches.” According to Buterin, instead of relying on servers with terabytes of storage, soon users will be able to run a full Ethereum node “without heavy-duty resources.” This first-of-its-kind case will be possible thanks to zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) that the Ethereum Foundation is currently implementing. zkEVMs are making nodes drastically lighter, cutting storage through verifying transactions without revealing and importing any information about them. On Ethereum’s L2s, zkEVMs already cut transaction costs by up to 90% and settle in their finality under three seconds. Buterin said the next step is bringing these improvements to the Ethereum mainnet, making blockchain interactions on it as fast and affordable as traditional web applications. At ETHKyiv 2025, Tomasz K. Stańczak, Co-Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation, spelled out exactly what’s next for Ethereum’s backbone: real performance gains on the mainnet itself. He revealed that by the end of 2026, Ethereum will move to 3-Slot Finality (3SF), slashing average transaction confirmation time from 15 minutes down to only 36 seconds. For users, this will bring the experience of instant traditional digital payments while keeping all the benefits of decentralization. Stańczak laid out the near-term milestones: Ethereum L1 will hit 400 transactions per second (TPS) by the end of 2025. Block gas limits will reach 100 million this year, with a jump to 60 million per block in a month or two (as of publication date—ed.). For context: scaling Ethereum L1 is essential because it anchors the entire ecosystem, providing the security, settlement, and censorship resistance Layer 2s depend on. With faster mainnet throughput, users get greater assurance their transactions are finalized on a decentralized, global network—not bottlenecked by L2 operators. As Vitalik Buterin summed up: “The goal is to make Ethereum more private, more censorship-resistant, and at the same time, so easy that even people far from tech feel safe using it every day.” For me and all the Ethereum followers, some big questions have always remained: what actually underpins Ethereum’s value, and what could trigger mass adoption? When I pressed both Vitalik Buterin and Tomasz Stańczak for answers at ETHKyiv 2025, they each zeroed in on different but connected drivers. Tomasz pointed to three non-negotiables: privacy, data protection, and transparency. According to him, these are precisely what enterprise clients and regular users now expect from any blockchain platform. “Ethereum is a global network, and increased adoption directly boosts the value of the whole ecosystem,” he explained. The more Ethereum is used for real-world utility—by businesses and by individuals—the more demand, and ultimately, value accrues. Vitalik, meanwhile, framed the adoption question around financial utility. His thesis: mass adoption comes when Ethereum becomes the rails for real-world assets, particularly tokenized stocks and bonds. “They’re the gateway to mass adoption and the bridge between traditional finance and Web3,” he said. With heavyweights like BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, and Coinbase actively leveraging Ethereum for asset tokenization, we’re already seeing the lines blur between traditional finance’s $117 trillion market and Web3 infrastructure. In short: Ethereum’s real value isn’t just speculative, but it’s being built right now at the intersection of security, privacy, and practical financial applications. That’s where mass adoption starts to look inevitable. ETHKyiv 2025 indeed stood out for its access to global thought leaders. Despite all the war-related risks, developers here heard first-hand insights from Ethereum’s most influential builders. As Stańczak himself described it: “Enterprise, DeFi, explorations, AI, research, day-to-day problems, working with people—we have to understand the direction and give feedback. A lot of it.” His daily routine—hours spent answering questions from developers—underscores how Ethereum’s power lies in its people, not just its protocol. Crucially, ETHKyiv 2025 was never just another tech event on the calendar. Held against the backdrop of an ongoing war, it became living proof of something bigger: even in the darkest times, Ukraine’s tech community chooses to build, learn, and connect with the global ecosystem. Throughout the hackathon, the wartime context was impossible to ignore, yet it wasn’t a shadow but a driving force. Performances by Moisei Bondarenko, the violinist-soldier whose music echoes through liberated Ukrainian cities, reminded everyone that innovation and humanity must go hand in hand. So did the tactical medicine session led by combat medic Artem Rudy, bringing practical skills and a sense of shared resilience to the room. This is what set ETHKyiv 2025 apart: it was a gathering of minds and hearts, a testament to the persistence of community, curiosity, and shared values—even in wartime. The world watched not just for the tech, but for the spirit of resilience and solidarity that Ukraine’s builders brought to the stage.

REUTERS/Stephane Mahe By Kat Hidalgo and Silas Brown Aug 1, 2025 (Bloomberg) –Terminal Investment Ltd., the port operator controlled by Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte, raised $2.5 billion through a privately-placed bond sale. The debt sale by the company, known as TiL, was split between seven, 10-, 12- and 20-year maturities, and ranks among the bigger private placements so far this year, according to people familiar with the matter. The package was denominated in both dollars and euros, they said. Citigroup Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. arranged the deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Citigroup declined to comment, Mizuho Financial Group, TiL and spokespeople for Gianluigi Aponte didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The so-called US private placement market is a way for blue-chip businesses to bypass volatile public markets and secure funds directly from institutional investors such as insurers. Related News: MSC Founder Emerges as Key Player in $19B Global Ports Deal The deal comes as tariff uncertainty is putting pressure on the shipping industry, with US and China negotiators continuing trade talks. The firm operates terminals in the port of Long Beach, where 60% of the trade comes directly from China. TiL is part of a consortium alongside Blackrock Inc. that’s bidding for CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.’s $22.8 billion sale of global ports. Aponte owns MSC, the controlling shareholder of TiL, according to the firm’s website. GIP and GIC also own stakes in the business. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Will data centers crash the economy?

The U.S. economic data for the last few months is looking decidedly meh. The latest employment numbers were so bad that Trump actually fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of manipulating the numbers to make him look bad. But there’s one huge bright spot amid the gloom: an incredible AI data center building boom. AI technology is advancing fast, threatening (promising?) to upend many sectors of the economy. Nobody knows yet exactly who will profit from this boom, but one thing that’s certain is that it’s going to take a lot of computing power (or “compute”, as they say). AI models take a lot of compute to train, but nowadays they also take a lot of compute to do inference — i.e., to “think about” and answer each question you ask. Inference compute now represents most of the cost of running advanced AI models, and increases in inference compute are responsible for many of the ongoing performance gains. So compute needs are probably only going to grow as AI keeps getting better. Whoever provides this compute is going to make a huge amount of revenue. Whether that means they’ll make a lot of profit is another question, but let’s table that for right now; you can’t make profit if you don’t make revenue. So right now, tech companies have the choice to either sit out of the boom entirely, or spend big and hope they can figure out how to make a profit. Roughly speaking, Apple is choosing the former, while the big software companies — Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — are choosing the latter. These spending numbers are pretty incredible: For Microsoft and Meta, this capital expenditure is now more than a third of their total sales. Here’s Chris Mims of the WSJ: The Magnificent 7 tech firms have collectively spent a record $102.5 billion on capex in their most recent quarters, nearly all from Meta, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Amazon. (Apple, Nvidia and Tesla together contributed a mere $6.7 billion.)… Investor and tech pundit Paul Kedrosky says that, as a percentage of gross domestic product, spending on AI infrastructure has already exceeded spending on telecom and internet infrastructure from the dot-com boom—and it’s still growing. He also argues that one explanation for the U.S. economy’s ongoing strength, despite tariffs, is that spending on IT infrastructure is so big that it’s acting as a sort of private-sector stimulus program… Capex spending for AI contributed more to growth in the U.S. economy in the past two quarters than all of consumer spending, says Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, citing data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. [emphasis mine] Here’s that chart from Kedrosky, who has been doing an excellent job following this story as it unfolds: Side note: I’m actually not sure Kedrosky is right about the height of the telecom boom. His chart shows the level of capex for 2020, when 5G and fiber infrastructure was being built out. But Doms (2004) shows U.S. telecom capex reaching $120 billion in 2000: That would have been around 1.2% of U.S. GDP at the time — about where the data center boom is now. But the data center boom is still ramping up, and there’s no obvious reason to think 2025 is the peak, so Kedrosky’s point still stands. I think it’s important to look at the telecom boom of the 1990s rather than the one in the 2010s, because the former led to a gigantic crash. The railroad boom led to a gigantic crash too, in 1873 (before the investment peak on Kedrosky’s chart). In both cases, companies built too much infrastructure, outrunning growth in demand for that infrastructure, and suffered a devastating bust as expectations reset and loans couldn’t be paid back. In both cases, though, the big capex spenders weren’t wrong, they were just early. Eventually, we ended up using all of those railroads and all of those telecom fibers, and much more. This has led a lot of people to speculate that big investment bubbles might actually be beneficial to the economy, since manias leave behind a surplus of cheap infrastructure that can be used to power future technological advances and new business models. But for anyone who gets caught up in the crash, the future benefits to society are of cold comfort. So a lot of people are worrying that there’s going to be a crash in the AI data center industry, and thus in Big Tech in general, if AI industry revenue doesn’t grow fast enough to keep up with the capex boom over the next few years.1 A data center bust would mean that Big Tech shareholders would lose a lot of money, like dot-com shareholders in 2000. It would also slow the economy directly, because Big Tech companies would stop investing. But the scariest possibility is that it would cause a financial crisis. Financial crises tend to involve bank debt. When a financial bubble and crash is mostly a fall in the value of stocks and bonds, everyone takes losses and then just sort of walks away, a bit poorer — like in 2000. Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2015) survey the history of bubbles and crashes, and they find that debt (also called “credit” and “leverage”) is a key predictor of whether a bubble ends up hurting the real economy. They write: Using a comprehensive dataset, covering a wide range of macroeconomic and financial variables, we demonstrate that it is the interaction of asset price bubbles and credit growth that poses the gravest risk to financial stability. These results, based on long-rung historical data, offer the first sound statistical support based on large samples for the widely held view that the financial stability risks stemming from of an unleveraged equity market boom gone bust (such as the U.S. dotcom bubble) can differ substantially from a credit-financed housing boom gone bust (such as the U.S. 2000s housing market). They use the terms “unleveraged” and “credit”, but what they really mean here — and the way they define their variable for credit growth — is specifically bank loans, not bonds. In the 2008 crash, most of the debt was held by banks, in one form or another. Thus, a wave of defaults threatened the solvency of the banking system, causing the entire economy to freeze up. But the banking system wasn’t in any real danger of collapse from the dot-com/telecom crash, because banks hadn’t lent a lot of money to people involved with the tech industry, so there weren’t a lot of loans to go bad. The telecom companies had borrowed a lot, but primarily via the bond markets rather than from banks, which at the time were more focused on housing and small business. Households also didn’t become significantly more indebted in the 90s (relative to their income), which is probably why there wasn’t a long and painful period of household deleveraging following the dotcom boom, the way there was after 2008. So if we believe this basic story of when to be afraid of capex busts, it means that we have to care about who is lending money to these Big Tech companies to build all these data centers. That way, we can figure out whether we’re worried about what happens to those lenders if Big Tech can’t pay the money back. Paul Kedrosky has a list: Where is all this capital coming from? For the most part, six sources: Internal Cash Flows (Primary for Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, etc. ) Debt Issuance (Rising role) Equity & Follow-on Offerings Venture Capital / Private Equity (CoreWeave, Lambda, etc.) SPVs, Leasing, and Asset-Backed Vehicles (like Meta's recent) Cloud Consumption Commitments (mostly hyperscalers) And The Economist writes: [C]apex is growing faster than [Big Tech’s] cashflows…The hot centre of the AI boom is moving from stockmarkets to debt markets…During the first half of the year investment-grade borrowing by tech firms was 70% higher than in the first six months of 2024. In April Alphabet issued bonds for the first time since 2020. Microsoft has reduced its cash pile but its finance leases—a type of debt mostly related to data centres—nearly tripled since 2023, to $46bn (a further $93bn of such liabilities are not yet on its balance-sheet). Meta is in talks to borrow around $30bn from private-credit lenders including Apollo, Brookfield and Carlyle. The market for debt securities backed by borrowing related to data centres, where liabilities are pooled and sliced up in a way similar to mortgage bonds, has grown from almost nothing in 2018 to around $50bn today… CoreWeave, an ai cloud firm, has borrowed liberally from private-credit funds and bond investors to buy chips from Nvidia. Fluidstack, another cloud-computing startup, is also borrowing heavily, using its chips as collateral. SoftBank, a Japanese firm, is financing its share of a giant partnership with Openai, the maker of ChatGPT, with debt. “They don’t actually have the money,” wrote Elon Musk when the partnership was announced in January. After raising $5bn of debt earlier this year xAI, Mr Musk’s own startup, is reportedly borrowing $12bn to buy chips. Some of these funding sources don’t seem that dangerous, in the macroeconomic sense. When Big Tech or other companies spend their own cash, issues stock, or issue bonds, it looks more like the telecom boom of the 1990s than the railroad boom of the 1800s. But what about all this “private credit”? These are the potentially scary part. Private credit funds are basically companies that take investment, borrow money, and then lend that money out in private (i.e. opaque) markets. They’re the debt version of private equity, and in recent years they’ve grown rapidly to become one of the U.S.’ economy’s major categories of debt: Private credit funds take some of their financing as equity, but they also borrow money. Some of this money is borrowed from banks. In 2013, only 1% of U.S. banks’ total loans to non-bank financial institutions was to private equity and private credit firms; today, it’s 14%. A recent note by Berrospide et al. of the Federal Reserve shows the rise in bank lending to private credit: BDCs are “Business Development Companies”, which are a type of private credit fund. If there’s a bust in private credit, that’s an acronym you’ll be hearing a lot. And I believe the graph above does not include bank purchases of bonds (CLOs) issued by private credit companies. If private credit goes bust, those bank assets will go bust too, making banks’ balance sheets weaker. A recent article by Fillat et al. of the Boston Fed argues that bank lending to private credit funds might pose a systemic risk to the banking system: The meteoric rise of private credit presents important questions about the role of banks going forward and the implications for stability in the US financial system…Our analysis of Federal Reserve and proprietary loan-level data indicates that the growth of private credit has been funded largely by bank loans and that banks have become a key source of liquidity, in the form of credit lines, for PC lenders. Banks’ extensive links to the PC market could be a concern because those links indirectly expose banks to the traditionally higher risks associated with PC loans. The authors point out that most of these are very short-term loans — hence safer than long-term loans like the ones that sunk banks in the financial crisis of 2008. And most of them are senior loans — if private credit goes bust, banks get paid out first. But they caution: [B]anks would suffer losses [on their private credit lending] only in severely adverse economic conditions, such as a deep and protracted recession. But losses could also occur in a less adverse scenario if the default correlation among the loans in PC portfolios turned out to be higher than anticipated—that is, if a larger-than-expected number of PC borrowers defaulted at the same time. Such tail risk may be underappreciated. If all the private credit funds are lending to data centers, then their correlations are probably pretty high — if there’s a bust in AI, a lot of them will go bust at once. This could be the “tail risk” that the Boston Fed folks are worried about, and it seems like there’s a chance it could hurt the U.S. banking system. A private credit bust also could hurt insurance companies, who are the main LPs in the funds, but who also lend money to the funds. For example, Carlino et al. (2025) show how life insurers have basically become a kind of bank that borrows money from institutional investors and lends it to private credit: They note, ominously, that “life insurers' exposure to below-investment-grade firm debt has boomed and now exceeds the industry's exposure to subprime residential mortgage-backed securities in late 2007.” I’m not exactly sure how systemically important life insurance companies are; they’re intertwined with the rest of the financial system through a number of channels, and it’s hard to tell how significant those challenges are. But it seems like the possibility is there for some systemic effects. Meanwhile, other types of insurers are starting to lend to private credit as well. Remember that AIG, an insurance company, was one of the most important bailouts in the financial crisis of 2008. So when I look at this entire landscape, it seems to me that some of the basic conditions of a financial crisis are at least starting to fall into place: We have a big story about why “this time is different” — the idea that AI will change everything, and that data centers will thus earn huge returns. We have a large and increasing amount of debt being used to fund one single sector of the economy (data centers), meaning that the loans’ default probability is probably highly correlated. We have an opaque corner of the financial system (private credit) that has recently grown from a tiny piece of the system to a very significant piece. We have systemically important lenders (banks, and possibly insurance companies) enmeshed in the new sector in a multitude of ways. So far, the danger doesn’t scream “2008”. But if you wait until 2008 to start worrying, you’re going to get 2008. It’s good to start worrying early. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, is not waiting to start sounding the alarm, warning that private credit could trigger the next financial crisis, even as his own company expands into the private credit market. As a former Citibank CEO said after 2008, “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.” Share Some people also worry that the U.S. power grid won’t be big and reliable enough to handle the new power demands from all these data centers. With Trump continuing his all-out attack on solar and wind energy, this is a real concern. I was expecting your next post to be about the BLS and how we can be expecting record grain harvests this year… Dumb questions alert... Why do “Business Development Companies” exist ? Why don't businesses just get their loans from banks ? I'll guess it's because BDC's will make loans that Banks won't? But if that's it, why do banks make loans to companies that make loans that by the bank's standards are too risky ? No posts Ready for more?

There is no question that 2025 has been a good year—so far—for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), garnering significant amounts of capital every week. While the investment products struggled at the start of the year, as did most of the global financial markets, the United States ETF market had a remarkable performance in the past quarter. Interestingly, July marked the start of another productive quarter for the crypto ETFs in the United States, with the investment products posting capital inflows in the month. According to the latest market data, July 2025 might be the best month yet for the digital asset-linked funds after registering tens of billions of dollars in capital influx in the 30-day period. On Friday, August 1, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas took to the social media platform X to reveal that the US crypto ETF market just had its best monthly performance yet in July 2025. According to the latest market data, the investment products took in more than $12.8 billion in capital—at a pace of $600 million per day—in the past month. To put into perspective, the pace of daily additions in July is about twice the average of the crypto exchange-traded funds. According to Balchunas, the digital asset-linked investment products outperformed every single ETF, including “the mighty VOO”—referring to Vanguard’s S&P 500 fund—over the past month. Balchunas added: Further, every ETF in category took in cash (ex the converted Trusts) w/ Bitcoin and Ether making equal contributions. Most all-around dominant performance since the Eagles ended the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. Will be hard to top. The US crypto ETF market is led by the Bitcoin spot ETFs, with a total asset of over $146.48 billion currently under management. The Bitcoin ETF is completely dominated by BlackRock’s IBIT, which has its total assets under management (AUM) at over $84 billion, and is followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at almost $23 billion. Meanwhile, the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds, which launched more than 6 months after their BTC counterparts, have a total AUM of $20.1 billion. Unsurprisingly, BlackRock also leads this market, with its ETH ETF (ETHA) having a total of $10.71 billion in assets under management. According to data from CoinGecko, the total crypto market capitalization stands at around $3.78 billion, having declined by 5% in the past 24 hours. On Friday, the crypto market succumbed to massive bearish pressure, with the top coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana suffering major losses. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Takeaways From Berkshire Hathaway’s Second Quarter 2025 Earnings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/02/takeaways-from-berkshire-hathaways-second-quarter-2025-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-08-02T19:53:07Z
Full Content:
ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) reported second-quarter earnings of almost $12.4 billion, well below the $30.3 billion in the same quarter of 2024, primarily due to a decline in stocks. Operating earnings, which remove the distortion from market changes and better reflect the firm’s earnings power, fell by 4% for the quarter versus 2024. Per-share operating income decreased by 4% for the quarter, with no share repurchases over the past year. Warren Buffett leads Berkshire as CEO and Chairman with Greg Abel, Vice Chairman of Non-insurance, and Ajit Jain, Vice Chairman of Insurance. Berkshire announced an impairment to its investment in Kraft Heinz (KHC). The investment had been carried on Berkshire’s books for more than its market value for some time, but some changes in circumstances caused the firm to take a pretax impairment loss of around $5.0 billion. This writedown is a non-cash charge, which reduces the “carrying value of our investment in Kraft Heinz to fair value.” Buffett has long acknowledged that he paid too much for Kraft Heinz, especially in light of the increased competition in the branded food category. Berkshire’s most significant business by operating earnings is insurance, followed by the manufacturing, service, and retailing segment. Insurance underwriting was the primary culprit behind the decline in operating earnings. Buffett noted at the annual meeting that Berkshire’s insurance earnings were as good as they get in 2024, so doing less well this year is unsurprising. Other income also declined significantly, primarily due to accounting for foreign currency swings. Excluding insurance and the “other” segment, operating earnings were 13% higher. The two most essential concepts in insurance investing are “float” and underwriting profit. In simple terms, float is created for insurance companies because insurance premiums are paid before any claims are made by the insured. Insurance companies can invest the float, sometimes for years, before insurance losses are reimbursed. Berkshire’s float at $174 billion is $3 billion higher than on December 31, 2024. In general, the value of float increases as yields rise since an insurance company can earn more when investing the cash. Float per share was $120,983, above the level at the end of 2024. Share repurchases were not an aid to the growth of float per share over the past year. The underwriting profit comparison versus the second quarter of 2024 was challenging, as Berkshire had achieved stellar insurance earnings last year. Notably, policies in force at GEICO grew in the second quarter. Berkshire has a history, unlike many insurance companies, of earning an underwriting profit, meaning that their float costs nothing and makes money in addition to allowing Berkshire to earn a profit from investing the float. Berkshire has three main insurance businesses: GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. All three had a profitable underwriting quarter. An underwriting profit means the insurance premium exceeds all insurance claims and expenses. For example, GEICO had a combined ratio of 83.5% in the second quarter, which means that only 83.5 cents of every dollar in insurance premiums were spent on losses and expenses. A combined ratio over 100% indicates the insurance company has an underwriting loss. For the second quarter of 2025, investment income was 1% higher than in 2024, primarily due to lower taxes. Notably, policies in force grew relative to the first quarter of 2024. Berkshire owns one of the largest railroads in North America, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad, which operates in the US and Canada. Railroad freight volume improved modestly, and operating earnings rose about 19% versus the same quarter last year. On a positive note, BNSF continued to see better productivity, which was the primary reason for the sharp rise in earnings. BNSF’s trailing 12-month operating ratio, operating expenses divided by revenue, improved in the second quarter, which is proof of the productivity improvement. Buffett noted at the annual meeting that the “railroad is not earning what it should,” but is” getting solved,” and the recent progress in reducing operating expenses supports his statement. BHE generally provides steady and growing earnings, as one would expect from what primarily consists of regulated utilities and pipeline companies. In addition, BHE typically produces significant tax credits due to its renewable electricity generation. For this reason, Berkshire focuses on after-tax earnings, which is “how the energy businesses are managed and evaluated.” BHE was modestly negative on the headline numbers, with operating earnings falling by 2.6% over the same quarter in 2024. The lack of wildfire loss accruals in the second quarter of 2025 for the US utilities segment flattered the year-over-year comparisons. In the second quarter of 2024, BHE’s US utilities group accrued $251 million for possible wildfire litigation losses. The decrease in earnings from the natural gas pipelines was primarily caused by higher interest expense, decreased margin, and lower other income. The other energy businesses saw a reduction in earnings, primarily from lower profits at Northern Powergrid. Pretax earnings rose by 4.7%. This segment consists of many diverse companies, so this analysis will focus on the best and worst performers and some themes when looking at this segment. Within the industrial segment, Marmon, “which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into twelve groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries,” saw a 6.9% increase in pretax earnings. The improvement was primarily due to “reductions of liabilities accrued in connection with a prior business acquisition,” with operating results in the twelve groups mixed. Elsewhere in the manufacturing segment, the building and consumer products groups accounted for the decline in pretax income. Within building products, Clayton Homes had better revenues, but lower pretax income due to “lower earnings from financial services.” Berkshire noted that their “building products businesses are experiencing slowing customer demand and pricing pressures, attributable to prevailing general economic conditions and housing markets. The decline in consumer products earnings was primarily from Forest River, Garan, Jazwares, and Duracell. Brooks Sports and Fruit of the Loom had better earnings. The service group saw a 15.2% increase in pretax earnings for the quarter, primarily attributable to the aviation services, TTI, leasing businesses, and Charter Brokerage. The retailing group saw a turnaround in earnings growth, with a 11.9% increase in pretax earnings for the quarter. The most critical portion of the retailing segment is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (BHA), which owns over 80 auto dealerships. BHA had 8% higher earnings compared to the second quarter of 2024. Pretax profits for the remainder of the retailing group rose by 23.9%, due primarily to “higher earnings from Nebraska Furniture Mart and seasonality effects at See’s Candies.” Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) is the largest operator of travel centers in North America, under the names Pilot and Flying J. On January 16, 2024, Berkshire acquired the final 20% and now owns 100% of the entity. PTC’s pretax earnings decreased 40.2% due to “lower gross sales margins and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.” McLane’s pretax earnings were 23.9% higher thanks to “an increase in the overall gross sales margin rate, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses.” This segment includes companies’ profits that must be accounted for under the equity method due to the size of ownership and influence on management. The after-tax equity method earnings have Berkshire’s proportionate share of profits attributable to its investments in Kraft Heinz (KHC), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Berkadia. Berkshire is Occidental Petroleum’s largest shareholder, with a 28.1% stake. More about the reasons for the Occidental investment is here. The segment experienced a 97% decline in operating earnings for the quarter, primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate losses generated from bonds issued by Berkshire Hathaway and denominated in British Pounds, euros, and Japanese Yen. These foreign currency swings are not a concern as Berkshire has significant assets and earnings denominated in these foreign currencies. Investment gains from non-U.S. dollar investments generally offset some of these losses and vice versa, depending on currency exchange rates. Acquisition accounting expenses are also reflected in this segment. These expenses are created by amortizing intangible assets connected to companies purchased by Berkshire. Finally, the gain in other earnings includes “Berkshire parent company investment income, corporate expenses, intercompany interest income on loans to operating subsidiaries when the related interest expense is included in earnings of the operating subsidiaries and unallocated income taxes.” Berkshire’s insurance company investment portfolio is currently 52% publicly traded stocks, with 44% in cash. Berkshire was a net seller of $3 billion in publicly traded stocks in the second quarter, the eleventh straight quarter of Berkshire Hathaway’s net sales of stocks. Berkshire bought $3.9 billion of stocks while selling $6.9 billion. The upcoming 13F filing on August 14 with the SEC will provide more specific buy and sell details, but some clues within the current filing point to more sales of Bank of America (BAC) and Apple (AAPL). Summary And Scorecard Berkshire’s stock price outperformed the S&P 500 in the first quarter, falling by 8.8% versus a total return of +10.9% from the S&P 500. Year-to-date through August 1, Berkshire’s price was +4.3%, while the S&P 500 had a total return of +6.9%. Short-term results are generally not meaningful for Berkshire since it is managed with a focus on increasing long-term value and not meeting quarterly hurdles. This ability to take advantage of time arbitrage has served the company and shareholders well over the years. The goal in looking at the results is to see if the segments are generally operating as expected and to consider Warren Buffett's capital allocation decisions. Previously, Buffett provided a handy blueprint for the goals of Berkshire’s management. The first goal would be to “increase operating earnings.” Secondly, success in the “decrease shares outstanding” goal would boost operating earnings per share faster. Lastly, “hope for an occasional big opportunity,” allowing for a sizable cash investment at an attractive expected return. This analysis will use Buffett’s blueprint as a lens through which to evaluate how Berkshire is performing. Increase operating earnings: Trailing 12-month operating earnings were 8.0% higher than last year’s same quarter. Buffett says that operating earnings are the “most descriptive” way to view Berkshire since they remove the short-term volatility of market fluctuations in net earnings. Decrease shares outstanding: Particularly since 2018, a significant capital allocation decision has been made to increase share repurchases. When Berkshire Hathaway actively repurchases shares, it signals when Buffett believes its share price is below his intrinsic value estimate. If he is correct, the purchases are a value-creator for the remaining shareholders. Berkshire has stated that there would be no stock repurchases if it would cause cash levels to fall below $30 billion, so the firm’s safety will not be compromised. Berkshire has not repurchased stock for the last five quarters. Until an announcement in mid-2018, Berkshire had only made repurchases when the stock traded at less than 1.2 times the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. While that constraint is now relaxed, it is still a good indicator of the general range when aggressive repurchases will likely be seen. Berkshire’s price-to-book ratio remained elevated during the quarter, so share repurchases were suspended. Berkshire only intends to repurchase shares when the “repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.” The price-to-book ratio remains a reasonable proxy for gauging Berkshire’s intrinsic value. The stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2024 were likely done at around 1.4-1.5 times book value. Berkshire’s stock reached almost 1.8 times book in May 2025, so a lack of repurchases in the quarter wasn’t unexpected. With the recent decline in the shares, the valuation is nearing a level where repurchases might restart. Still, Warren Buffett’s judgment about its intrinsic value versus other available uses of capital can differ from the simple price-to-book measure. A longer-term view of the positive impact of Berkshire’s share repurchases is illuminating. Since the start of more aggressive share repurchases in 2018, Berkshire’s operating earnings have grown at a 16.5% compound growth rate, while operating earnings per share have done 2.1 percentage points better at 18.6%. Eagle-eyed readers might notice that operating earnings growth oddly exceeded operating earnings per share growth over the last year. Berkshire issued some shares to purchase the remainder of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE) in October 2024. Hope for an occasional big opportunity: Berkshire has a fortress balance sheet with cash and equivalents of over $339 billion. Cash as a percentage of Berkshire Hathaway’s size is close to the highest on record, at 29.6%. This cash hoard provides flexibility to take advantage of opportunities, including repurchasing its stock if the price declines to attractive levels. Share repurchases had been off the table at the elevated valuations, but an additional lever for Buffett to create value might soon return. Shareholders should take comfort in knowing that the firm is well-positioned to withstand and emerge stronger from any tariff shocks, recession, or market downturn, thanks to its financial resilience, which enables it to capitalize on opportunities during a crisis. Buffett announced at the end of the annual meeting in May that he planned to step down from the CEO role at the end of the year. Greg Abel will assume the CEO role and have the “final word on operations or capital deployment.” Notably, Buffett will remain Chairman to provide any needed guidance and intends to retain all his shares in the company. Some are attributing the relative weakness in Berkshire’s share price to Buffett’s announcement of leaving the CEO role, but the proximate cause likely lies elsewhere. Investors flocked to Berkshire stock as a haven when the odds of recession soared with the tariff threat. As the fear of recession receded, some investors re-allocated to other stocks, and Berkshire’s valuation had become stretched in May. While Berkshire’s quarterly operating earnings were down modestly year-over-year, there were some pleasant surprises in the data. Excluding insurance and the other segment, which is heavily impacted by foreign exchange volatility, operating profits grew 13% year-over-year. The BNSF railroad made significant progress in improving productivity to drive higher profits. The manufacturing, service, and retailing segment was surprisingly resilient with 12% year-over-year operating earnings growth. Lastly, one of Berkshire’s crown jewels, GEICO, seems to be back in profitable growth mode with policies in force continuing to rise. Disclosure: Bill Stone a long-time shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway and worked for Salomon Brothers when Warren Buffett became Chairman and CEO. Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and other companies mentioned within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Corporate America is not falling for the left’s outrage over Sydney Sweeney’s ‘good jeans’ ad

Full Content:
The left is trying its best to stir up a furor over the recent Sydney Sweeney jeans (or is it genes) TV commercial to ignite a backlash similar to the Dylan Mulvaney-Bud Light debacle. Sorry progressives, it ain’t happening. Yes, there’s lots of chirping from lefty columnists, purple-haired TikTok influencers, late-night hosts who are still employed, and assorted wokesters after American Eagle had the audacity to feature the attractive blond, blue-eyed actress expressing her sartorial flair in a pair of tight-fitting blue jeans. “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color . . . my jeans are blue,” the “Euphoria” star says. The ad ends with a voice-over: “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.” Blond women? Blue-eyed? Good genes (I mean jeans)? Oh, the horror! That’s if you are listening to the leftist commentariat that still hasn’t piped down weeks after the spot first appeared. The lefties are freaking because they think the jeans company is looking to bring back the bad old days, pre-George Floyd of course, when white blond oppressors ruled over American culture. It’s all very Hitler-like to the progressive numbskull class, but not to just about every other segment of American society. Most Americans of all colors and genders either don’t care, or they know good genes and jeans when they see it. I know this based on lots of reporting on the mind virus known wokeness — the progressive orthodoxy that embraces everything from cultural Marxism, DEI and, of course, the oppressor-oppressed theology. We are a diverse country, and that’s good. The wokesters take it to a level that excludes rather than includes. Good-looking white people, particularly if their hair is that evil shade known as blond, are nowhere near the intersectional matrix they demand for hiring or image making in their version of America. That’s why Sydney Sweeney, known more for her cleavage than her politics, has become a touchstone in our culture wars, and here’s why the attacks won’t work: Wokeness was once big in the business world, but notice my use of the past tense. Corporate America listened to these kooks for many reasons, including their own progressive management leanings, with disastrous results. They learned the hard way that most Americans of all races hate being proselytized with political dogma, particularly of the left-wing variety that pushes the limits of identity and gender politics beyond cultural norms. I chronicled this spectacle with a healthy dose of schadenfreude in my book “Go Woke Go Broke: The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America.” Just a few short years ago, DEI was the norm; so was radical environmentalism pushed by asset managers through something called ESG investing. It was difficult finding a straight man or woman — God forbid a blond — who survived the Madison Avenue woke censor machine. Budweiser thought its customers were ready for a commercial featuring a half-naked trans woman in a bubble bath. Disney decided it could sell more kids programming featuring same-sex kissing scenes. Money managers like BlackRock thought they could increase returns by advocating environmentalism and de facto racial quotas on their portfolio companies. All of the above resulted in some of the biggest brand-destroying disasters in modern business history. Marketing is a lot like politics. It’s a business of addition, not subtraction. You build customers just like you attract voters, through messaging that unites rather than divides — or customers flee. There are exceptions, of course. Niche brands like Ben & Jerry’s ice cream attempt and succeed at targeting the tree-hugger demo. Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Try this stuff on a mass audience and you will get the beatdown of the century. The predictable customer revolt impacted the businesses of Budweiser, Disney and BlackRock in such a measurable way that shareholders revolted, too, forcing some of the most progressive CEOs in the world to course-correct. That’s why the Sydney Sweeney uproar will go nowhere with the people who matter most: Most American consumers, and American Eagle shareholders. Unless you’re stretching it like Silly Putty, there’s nothing inherently political about a pretty blond (dare I say “All American”-looking) woman in jeans and pointing out the health of her genes to sell stuff. Zero. Zilch. Otherwise, Pamela Anderson would have been a poster child for Aryan Nations instead of the “Baywatch” babe most American men and many women adored, and still do. Shares of American Eagle are up since the Sydney Sweeney ad ran, despite the backlash. NYU Marketing Professor Eitan Muller points out the obvious, telling Fox Business’s Teuta Dedvukaj that the commercial “attracts attention, drives Google searches, and boosts the brand. Yes, she does have great genes — and it rings authentic. That’s what you want from an ad.” My bet: You will be seeing a lot more of Sydney Sweeney. Most men will be rejoicing, many women will buy the company’s jeans. Management will be rewarded with higher sales and a stock price that matches. The attacks will ultimately fail for the same reason Mulvaney’s tenure as a spokeswoman for Bud Light was so short-lived. Recall: The nation’s Number 1-selling beer dropped to Number 3 and never recovered. Sydney Sweeney has both good jeans and genes and there’s nothing the wokesters can do to change that reality.

Title: No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own—Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Reports have disclosed that XRP community commentator Versan Aljarrah says XRP could gain a link to gold without actually holding bullion. According to Aljarrah, XRP would simply move gold-backed stablecoins across the XRP Ledger. The commentator argues that this role would give XRP a “synthetic connection” to tokenized assets like gold and oil, even though XRP itself would not carry any gold reserves. According to Aljarrah, XRP only needs to power the on-chain movement of gold-pegged coins. Based on reports, each gold token on the XRPL would represent one gram of real gold. Custodians such as MKS Pamp and Imperial Vaults would hold the physical bars. XRP would then step in to provide liquidity and settle trades on the ledger’s built-in exchange. Aljarrah sees this setup as a way for the altcoin to stay useful in global finance. $XRP doesn’t need to be backed by gold. It just needs to move it. When gold-pegged stablecoins live on $XRPL, XRP bridges them. And in doing so, it becomes synthetically linked to gold, oil, and every asset they tokenize. pic.twitter.com/q0Ti2pQuDp — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) July 27, 2025 Meld Gold is the only issuer currently close to launching a gold token on the XRPL. Reports have disclosed that Meld plans to back each token with one gram of physical gold. The firm says it will work with major vault operators. So far, no other gold token projects, including PAX Gold (PAXG), have moved onto XRP’s network. Supporters hope that more issuers will follow once Meld proves the concept. Reports note that issuing gold tokens is more than writing code. Each issuer must tie its token to audits, legal contracts and insured vaults. On top of that, XRP’s fixed supply and decentralized consensus system make direct asset backing tricky. Matt Hamilton, a former Ripple developer, has said the crypto asset can’t be backed by gold in a traditional way. Analysts add that its price moves with adoption, legal clarity and market mood, not by hype. Meanwhile, Aljarrah says big names like JPMorgan, BlackRock, the Bank for International Settlements and the IMF have made private plans to use XRP as a bridge. Yet no public evidence supports that claim. Most large asset managers have focused on blockchains with clear rules. Until the Ripple-SEC lawsuit ends, top institutions are likely to hold back. That case could decide if XRP is treated like a security, and that will affect any tokenized assets on the XRPL. According to analysis, a bridge role alone won’t peg XRP’s price to the spot gold rate of $2,950 that some in the community mention. Instead, if gold-pegged tokens take off, the altcoin could see more trading volume and tighter spreads. That might nudge its price upward, but it would still trade on its own merits as a liquidity tool for cross-border payments.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: US Crypto Exchange-Traded Funds Beat Out Vanguard’s Legendary S&P 500 ETF in Record-Setting Month of Inflows: Analyst

Time Published: 2025-08-02T16:55:13Z
Full Content:
New data from senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas reveals that US crypto ETFs (exchange-traded funds) beat out Vanguard’s renowned S&P 500 ETF (VOO) in July. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Balchunas notes that US crypto ETFs had a staggering $12.8 billion worth of inflows in July, outpacing all other ETFs, including VOO, which currently has $713.13 billion in assets under its management. “US Crypto ETFs took in $12.8 billion in July, the best month ever, [at] a $600m/day pace, about double [the] average. As a group, that’s more than any single ETF did, including the Mighty VOO. Further, every ETF in [the] category took in cash (ex the converted trusts) w/ Bitcoin and Ether making equal contributions. Most all-around dominant performance since the Eagles ended the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. Will be hard to top.” The analyst goes on to say that asset management titan BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is doing well and drawing in new customers. “Amazing stat: 75% of the investors who bought IBIT ($87 billion via one million people) were first-time customers of BlackRock. And 27% of them went on to buy another iShares ETF. Just a total coup for BLK all around.” According to Balchunas, IBIT – which launched in January 2024 – had a significant hand in Bitcoin’s (BTC) massive price growth over the last two years. “1) ETFs hold BTC at a 1:1 ratio. There is no lending, there is no paper IOUs. ETFs are clean and above board and every dime of AUM is connected to the proportional Bitcoin. 2) Zoom out: Bitcoin is up nearly 300%(!) since the infamous BlackRock filing two years ago. ETF flows big part of that. 3) From what I am hearing on here, the selling is annoyed OGs who don’t like that Wall St. and the government has adopted BTC. I guess they prefer BTC to have intermediaries like Sam Bankman-Fraud instead.” Bitcoin is trading for $113,763 at time of writing, a 3.2% decrease on the day while IBIT and VOO are valued at $64.27 and $572, respectively.

Title: Ethereum Eyes a Push Toward $4,800 as BlackRock Pushes for Staking in Spot ETH ETF

Ethereum (ETH) continues to hold strong above the key $3,500 level, fueling bullish momentum that could set the stage for a retest of its $4,878 all-time high (ATH). Calling out this development, HolderStat noted that if ETH holds above the $3,500–$3,600 zone, bulls could reclaim control and target the $4,600–$4,800 resistance, with the macro trend staying bullish unless support breaks decisively. The on-chain metrics provider added, “ETH surged past 4,400 recently and has now entered a corrective phase, dipping toward the 3,576 support zone. The move follows a series of triangle breakouts, and the current retracement is consistent with a bullish continuation pattern.” Ethereum soared to its historic high price of $4,878 in November 2021 and has yet to reclaim that level in more than three years. If HolderStat’s analysis sees the light of day, ETH might surge to this level. At the time of this writing, Ethereum was trading at $3,450, according to CoinMarketCap data. BlackRock is breaking new ground in institutional crypto by seeking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval to enable staking in its spot ETH ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), marking a bold step toward yield-generating digital assets. If approved, ETHA would be one of the first listed spot Ethereum ETFs on American soil to offer built-in staking rewards. Unlike current ETFs that only track ETH’s price, ETHA could unlock a 3% annual yield, bridging the gap with native holders and boosting capital efficiency. The SEC has up to 45 days, which is extendable to 90, to respond, with a final deadline potentially in April 2026, though analysts anticipate a decision as early as late 2025. Meanwhile, close to 1 million Ethereum, worth a whopping $3.43 billion, has been permanently lost to user error, underscoring a major vulnerability in crypto asset management and self-custody.

Title: Ireland come from behind to take late win over Scotland in World Cup warm-up

If Ireland showed some pre-World Cup rust, they quickly shook it off to overturn a 14-point deficit in a five-try victory over Scotland in Cork. First international tries from props Sadhbh McGrath and Niamh O’Dowd, plus Exeter Chiefs debutant Nancy McGillivray, were highlight moments from the six-point success. After the double sickener of losing backrowers Erin King and Dorothy Wall for the World Cup, the form of Grace Moore to earn player-of-the-match honours was most welcome. Head coach Scott Bemand was also boosted by the returns of captain Sam Monaghan and Béibhinn Parsons for their first caps in 15 months. With gaps to fill in the pack, Bemand handed debuts to Connacht flankers Ivana Kiripati from the start and Ailish Quinn off the bench. Amid early nerves, Kiripati knocked on from a lineout and Lisa Thomson pounced for the opening touchdown before also converting. Within six minutes Scotland unleashed a set-piece power play as Lucia Scott sliced through untouched to score. Thomson’s conversion made it 14-0. But a serious injury to Lana Skeldon seemed to take the wind out of their sails. Ireland made that momentum swing count as 20-year-old prop McGrath barged over for her first international try. Dannah O’Brien’s conversion hit the post. It was two tries in four minutes when Moore’s break led to a quick-passing move which saw Méabh Deely race home. O’Brien nailed the touchline conversion to trail 14-12 at half-time. It took six second-half minutes before Ireland grabbed their first lead. Kiripati was initially held up over the line, but once Scotland kicked the restart out on the full, Ireland punished them with McGillivray’s memorable debut try. The lead remained at three as O’Brien missed off the tee. Scottish discipline continued to erode. A deliberate knock-on saw winger Coreen Grant sinbinned as they coughed up 11 consecutive penalties either side of half-time. Out of nothing, the visitors got back ahead in their last play with 14 players. Poor defending allowed Emma Orr to sprint through a gap to touch down before Thomson’s kick made it 21-17. But Ireland dug deep to edge ahead after 67 minutes. O’Dowd ripped possession out of Scottish hands before the Wexford native found herself at the end of the move to dive over. Enya Breen’s conversion came up short. They earned a late cushion when Deirbhile Nic a Bháird dashed over from an advancing lineout maul. Breen became the second home kicker to strike the post, but their lead was never threatened. Scoring sequence – 15 mins: Thomson try, con 0-7; 21: Scott try, Thomson con 0-14; 34: McGrath try 5-14; 37: Deely try, O’Brien con 12-14; Half-time 12-14; 45: McGillivray try 17-14; 63: Orr try, Thomson con 17-21; 67: O’Dowd try 22-21; 76: Nic a Bháird try 27-21 IRELAND: M Deely (Blackrock College/Connacht); B Parsons (Blackrock College/Connacht), N McGillivray (Exeter Chiefs), E Higgins (Railway Union/Leinster), A-L Costigan (Railway Union/Munster); D O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), M Scuffil-McCabe (Manawatū/Leinster); S McCarthy (Railway Union/Munster), C Moloney-MacDonald (Exeter Chiefs), S McGrath (Cooke/Ulster); E Corri-Fallon (Blackrock College/Leinster), S Monaghan (Gloucester Hartpury/IQ Rugby, capt); G Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby), I Kiripati (Creggs/Connacht), B Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster).

Title: Strategy owning 3–7% of Bitcoin supply is not too much – Michael Saylor

Strategy to double down on preferred stock offerings for more BTC buys. Saylor implied that there was nothing wrong with his firm eyeing 1.5 million BTC, or about 7% of the BTC total supply. The firm saw a profitable Q2, the first time following several red quarters. Michael Saylor, chairman of Strategy (MicroStrategy), has downplayed concerns about the firm’s aggressive Bitcoin [BTC] buys, which now control 3% of the overall BTC supply. In a recent CNBC interview, Saylor stated, “I don’t think owning 3% to 7% of Bitcoin supply is too much. BlackRock has more than that.” Strategy currently holds 628,791 BTC, about 3% of the overall BTC supply. A 7% target would imply owning 1,470,000 BTC or about 1.5 million coins. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The firm also revealed a profitable Q2 during the latest earnings call held on the 31st of July. It made $10 billion in net income in Q2, marking the first profitable quarter after a series of losses. Additionally, its BTC holding gain hit $13.2 billion on a YTD (year-to-date) basis. The aggressive BTC acquisition has been funded through stock issuance and debt. However, the ongoing sale of stocks to raise capital has led to share dilution amid a drop in mNAV (modified net asset value), an indicator that tracks the market value of a firm relative to its BTC holdings. To prevent further dilution, Strategy said that it will only sell MSTR shares when the mNAV is above 2.5x. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel hailed the move as ‘best in class’ for MSTR treasury management. Source: Excerpt from Strategy’s earnings report At press time, the mNAV was at 1.62x, down from the record level of 3.89x hit last November. Now, the firm will focus on the yield-bearing preferred perpetual stocks to raise the capital for BTC buys. They include Stretch [STRC], Strike [STRK], Stride [STRD], and Strife [STRF]. But Stretch [STRC] appeared to be the most favorable perpetual preferred stock, going by the largest $2.5 billion raise that was finalized recently to buy over 21K BTC. It has a variable yield based on market performance, and Saylor billed it as a ‘treasury BTC,’ more like a money market fund. In contrast, he presented the common stock MSTR as ‘amplified BTC’ for those seeking a 2x BTC exposure. In fact, Saylor viewed MSTR as undervalued at current levels, citing its $24B estimated net income and shared the firm’s post that stated, “Strategy is misunderstood and undervalued $MSTR” Source: Strategy/X In a note to clients, Wall Street analysts at Benchmark echoed the same and placed a buy rating for MSTR with a price target of $705, adding that, “The upshot is that MSTR is not just buying bitcoin anymore, but instead engineering a corporate treasury machine designed to generate Bitcoin-denominated returns, manage its capital raises with precision, and scale faster.” At press time, MSTR was valued at $366.63, down 8.7% during the intra-day trading session on the 1st of August. BTC was down only 2% over the same period. Source: MSTR, TradingView Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, is doubling down on Bitcoin. Executive chairman Michael Saylor went on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Friday to explain why the company isn’t just holding the cryptocurrency—it’s building its business around it. Saylor called Bitcoin “digital capital” and revealed that Strategy has now bought over 628,000 BTC, which is worth around $72 billion. That makes up nearly 3% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist. The company recently raised $2.5 billion through an IPO of Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, selling 28 million shares at $90 each. Those funds were used to buy 21,021 BTC on July 29. According to Saylor, Strategy has done four fundraising rounds this year. Two of them pulled in $500 million each, and another brought in $1 billion. The fourth and latest offering, which raised $2.5 billion, was reportedly the biggest IPO of 2025 so far based on gross proceeds. This business model—raising capital and using it to buy Bitcoin—isn’t just about holding crypto. Saylor believes it turns volatile digital assets into refined securities that can appeal to professional investors. He called the new offering, branded as “Stretch” (STRC), the company’s most exciting product yet. Saylor also spoke about how other companies are joining the Bitcoin movement. He said that more than 160 public companies now hold Bitcoin in their reserves, compared to around 60 a year ago. Public companies in total own about 955,048 BTC, which is 4.55% of the total supply. He added that Bitcoin is starting to replace traditional assets like gold, real estate, and even equity as a store of value. Saylor argued that Bitcoin is “demonetizing” these older asset classes. For companies looking to increase value for shareholders, he suggested that putting money into Bitcoin makes more sense than holding onto cash or buying things like private equity. Saylor made it clear that his company isn’t trying to hoard the whole supply of Bitcoin. While he thinks owning 3% to 7% of it isn’t “too much,” he stressed that Strategy wants others to have a share too. He pointed out that BlackRock, through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), actually holds more BTC—around 740,896 at the moment. He also mentioned why big tech firms like Apple and Microsoft don’t buy each other’s stocks or S&P 500 companies. According to him, SEC rules stop them from doing that, so they’re limited to buying back their own shares. Saylor believes that if these rules didn’t exist, many of the large tech companies would likely invest in each other—and maybe even Bitcoin.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs Set A New Record In July With $5.4 Billion Monthly Inflow

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a powerful show of investor confidence, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke all records in July with $5.43 billion in net inflows. It marks the highest monthly inflow since their market debut and reflects a sharp 369% rise from June’s inflow of $1.16 billion. With 20 straight days of net inflows, spot ETH ETFs are now cementing Ethereum’s growing role as a leading digital asset in the eyes of traditional market participants. According to data from SoSoValue, the $5.43 billion net inflow in July also dwarfed May’s $564 million and April’s $66.25 million. It completely reversed the negative outflow trend seen in March, which saw a $403 million drop. As a result of this rise, cumulative net inflows across all spot Ether ETFs have now reached $9.64 billion, showing a 129% increase compared to June’s cumulative total. The massive growth didn’t stop at inflows alone. Total net assets across all spot ETH ETFs jumped to $21.52 billion, doubling from $10.32 billion just a month earlier. These funds now account for 4.77% of Ethereum’s entire market capitalization, showing that ETFs are becoming a gateway for capital entering the ETH market. Institutional interest has played a role in this growth as BlackRock’s ETHA remains the leading spot Ethereum ETF by assets, pulling in $18.18 million on July 31 and now holding $11.37 billion. Fidelity’s FETH also gained $5.62 million that same day, raising its net assets to $2.55 billion. Grayscale’s ETHE still manages a solid $4.22 billion asset base, even with a $6.8 million outflow, showing its continued relevance. The record-setting ETF inflows also lined up with a sharp price rally in ETH throughout July. ETH started the month at $2,486 and climbed to a high of $3,933, an increase of nearly 60%. By the end of the month, it had settled at $3,698, making July Ethereum’s strongest monthly price move since October 2021. The steady rise in ETF inflows could be a key driver behind this surge, showing that more capital entering the space may have directly boosted market sentiment and pricing. The ETH rally also marked the longest bullish monthly candle in nearly three years. As prices climbed, the spot ETFs recorded their longest-ever streak of daily net inflows, 20 days in a row without a single outflow after July 8. Some of the single-day gains came mid-month, including $726.7 million on July 16, $602 million on July 17, and $533.8 million on July 22. Ethereum could challenge its all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021, as its rising role in decentralized finance and the growing use of regulated investment vehicles could help the asset. If the current pace of inflows and trading activity continues, it could soon take center stage in a broader altcoin-led market cycle. My name is Sandra White. I am a graduate.

Title: 6 Top Growth Stocks To Buy For August 2025

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Bullish about stocks for the rest of 2025? You’re not alone. Even as the August 1 start date for higher tariffs has arrived, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite are trending up and flirting with new highs. Plus, analysts from Oppenheimer Asset Management, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and RBC Capital Markets have raised their 2025 S&P 500 targets. When market optimism is high, growth stocks can pad your wealth quickly. Let's meet six top growth stocks that deserve a closer look. The best growth stocks to buy for August are S&P 500 constituents that meet these criteria: The resulting stock list was ordered from highest to lowest EPS growth expectation, and the top six were chosen for inclusion. The table below identifies six growth stocks that fit the parameters noted above. Two of these stocks are also featured in: best stocks for 2025. A review of each company follows. Metrics are sourced from company reports and stockanalysis.com, unless noted otherwise. Howmet Aerospace by the numbers: Howmet Aerospace provides jet engine components, fastening systems and structural components for aerospace and defense applications. The company also serves the commercial transportation industry with forged aluminum wheels. HWM stock is up 72.1% for the year, thanks to strong earnings and an upbeat outlook for 2025. Howmet specializes in parts that support lightweight, fuel-efficient designs for aircraft and commercial trucks. This is an advantage in the current environment. Airline manufacturing activity has been light in recent years and fleets are aging. As a result, demand is growing for low-maintenance, fuel-efficient aircraft. Howmet is relying on efficient operational execution to leverage the strong demand for its technology. This shows up in the financial statements as higher adjusted operating income margin and free cash flow. Some excess cash remains on the balance sheet, and some was used for debt repayment. Improved liquidity and lower debt have strengthened Howmet’s financial position. Fitch recently confirmed this by raising the company's long-term issuer default rating from BBB to BBB+. After delivering a 46% increase to adjusted EPS in 2024, Howmet expects a 26.4% gain in 2025. Nvidia by the numbers: Nvidia designs high-powered GPUs and related hardware and software. The company earns most of its revenue from data center infrastructure products, including AI-capable GPUs. Since 2024, Nvidia has been the dominant market-share leader in the high-growth AI chips segment. NVDA stock is up 31.6% for the year and 1,601.8% over the past five years. Now the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia has been delivering impressive quarter-over-quarter revenue gains since the second quarter of fiscal 2024—when AI chip demand began to skyrocket. Nvidia’s market position, client list and technological prowess put the company in a class by itself. While anything's possible, it's hard to imagine a competitor taking a meaningful share of Nvidia's business. That’s an enviable position because the demand outlook for AI infrastructure remains quite strong. Citigroup analyst Atif Malik recently projected the 2028 total addressable market for AI chips to reach $563 billion, up 13% from a prior outlook. And Google parent Alphabet has said it will invest $75 billion in its data centers this year. For the quarter ended in April 2025, Nvidia reported 69% revenue growth and 33% non-GAAP diluted EPS growth versus the prior-year quarter. Motorola Solutions by the numbers: Motorola provides video security, land mobile radio communication and command center solutions and technology. Most of the company's revenue, 70%, comes from public safety customers, including police forces and 911 centers. The remaining 30% is split among enterprise customers in various industries, including utilities, hospitality, manufacturing and retail. MSI stock is down 7.4% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Investors may have been put off by the company’s conservative guidance for 2025's first and second quarters. A lower-growth expectation for two quarters isn’t a dealbreaker for MSI because there are other things to like about this company: In the quarter ending May 1, 2025, MSI delivered 6% revenue growth and 13% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the prior-year quarter. Amazon by the numbers: Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce retailer and the global market-share leader in cloud computing services. E-commerce delivers most of Amazon's revenue, but the higher-margin AWS cloud computing business provides higher operating income. AMZN stock is up 6.1% for the year after recovering from a dip from March through May. Over the past 12 months, AMZN has gained 28%. Amazon’s diversified business model has delivered revenue growth for years. Diluted EPS has been less consistent, but the 2024 result of $5.53 versus $2.90 in the prior year did make a statement. Based on announcements made in Amazon’s first quarter report, the company is firing on multiple cylinders. It's using AI to enhance the Amazon.com shopping experience as it expands the product set and geographic reach. The company is also growing its entertainment business and audience, with successful launches of Reacher Season 3 and LeBron James' Mind the Game podcast. And AWS is broadening its AI and computing capabilities as it secures new contract wins with premier customers like Adobe and Nasdaq. In the quarter ending on May 1, Amazon increased net revenue 9% and diluted 47.5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Mastercard Incorporated by the numbers: Mastercard processes digital payments in the U.S. and internationally. The per-transaction revenue model creates gains when spending across the Mastercard network increases or prices rise. Mastercard also has a growing services business encompassing security, marketing and other value-added services. MA stock is up 7.9% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Mastercard has the second-largest market share in U.S. credit card processing after Visa. According to Capital One Shopping, consumers charged $2.78 trillion to their Mastercards in 2024. Looking ahead, the outlook for consumer spending for 2025 is mixed, with some analysts predicting a slowdown in the second half. So far, Mastercard’s results show no signs of a spending slowdown. The company's last earnings report noted higher gross dollar volume and higher cross-border volume. Mastercard has also made strides diversifying its business model with initiatives like: Mastercard’s high operating margin in the upper 50s provides flexibility to pursue these and other growth initiatives. For the quarter ending on May 1, Mastercard reported constant-currency revenue and EPS growth of 17% and 15%, respectively. Disclosure: Author owns Microsoft stock. Microsoft by the numbers: Microsoft develops and maintains productivity software, sells cloud computing services and provides gaming hardware and content. MSFT stock is up 21.6% for the year after two positive earnings surprises and several analyst price target increases. Microsoft is the number two player in the cloud computing space, behind Amazon’s AWS. Modern platforms provide the environment for AI application development, training and deployment—so this high-margin space benefits directly from the AI revolution. It’s not surprising that Microsoft's ongoing investments in its cloud and AI offerings are driving profitable growth and substantial operating cash flow. The cash performance continues to provide the tech company with ample funding for growth initiatives and its modest dividend yield of 0.65%. (For higher-yielding dividend-payers, see best dividend stocks.) For the quarter ending on March 31, Microsoft reported constant-currency revenue and diluted EPS growth of 15% and 19%, respectively. Bottom Line High-flying growth stocks can produce quick gains in your portfolio—if you time things right. But because the stock market always has surprises on tap, make sure you're diversified and prepared financially for long holding periods. If you need help diversifying, see this list of best ETFs for 2025.

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Bullish about stocks for the rest of 2025? You’re not alone. Even as the August 1 start date for higher tariffs has arrived, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite are trending up and flirting with new highs. Plus, analysts from Oppenheimer Asset Management, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and RBC Capital Markets have raised their 2025 S&P 500 targets. When market optimism is high, growth stocks can pad your wealth quickly. Let's meet six top growth stocks that deserve a closer look. The best growth stocks to buy for August are S&P 500 constituents that meet these criteria: The resulting stock list was ordered from highest to lowest EPS growth expectation, and the top six were chosen for inclusion. The table below identifies six growth stocks that fit the parameters noted above. Two of these stocks are also featured in: best stocks for 2025. A review of each company follows. Metrics are sourced from company reports and stockanalysis.com, unless noted otherwise. Howmet Aerospace by the numbers: Howmet Aerospace provides jet engine components, fastening systems and structural components for aerospace and defense applications. The company also serves the commercial transportation industry with forged aluminum wheels. HWM stock is up 72.1% for the year, thanks to strong earnings and an upbeat outlook for 2025. Howmet specializes in parts that support lightweight, fuel-efficient designs for aircraft and commercial trucks. This is an advantage in the current environment. Airline manufacturing activity has been light in recent years and fleets are aging. As a result, demand is growing for low-maintenance, fuel-efficient aircraft. Howmet is relying on efficient operational execution to leverage the strong demand for its technology. This shows up in the financial statements as higher adjusted operating income margin and free cash flow. Some excess cash remains on the balance sheet, and some was used for debt repayment. Improved liquidity and lower debt have strengthened Howmet’s financial position. Fitch recently confirmed this by raising the company's long-term issuer default rating from BBB to BBB+. After delivering a 46% increase to adjusted EPS in 2024, Howmet expects a 26.4% gain in 2025. Nvidia by the numbers: Nvidia designs high-powered GPUs and related hardware and software. The company earns most of its revenue from data center infrastructure products, including AI-capable GPUs. Since 2024, Nvidia has been the dominant market-share leader in the high-growth AI chips segment. NVDA stock is up 31.6% for the year and 1,601.8% over the past five years. Now the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia has been delivering impressive quarter-over-quarter revenue gains since the second quarter of fiscal 2024—when AI chip demand began to skyrocket. Nvidia’s market position, client list and technological prowess put the company in a class by itself. While anything's possible, it's hard to imagine a competitor taking a meaningful share of Nvidia's business. That’s an enviable position because the demand outlook for AI infrastructure remains quite strong. Citigroup analyst Atif Malik recently projected the 2028 total addressable market for AI chips to reach $563 billion, up 13% from a prior outlook. And Google parent Alphabet has said it will invest $75 billion in its data centers this year. For the quarter ended in April 2025, Nvidia reported 69% revenue growth and 33% non-GAAP diluted EPS growth versus the prior-year quarter. Motorola Solutions by the numbers: Motorola provides video security, land mobile radio communication and command center solutions and technology. Most of the company's revenue, 70%, comes from public safety customers, including police forces and 911 centers. The remaining 30% is split among enterprise customers in various industries, including utilities, hospitality, manufacturing and retail. MSI stock is down 7.4% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Investors may have been put off by the company’s conservative guidance for 2025's first and second quarters. A lower-growth expectation for two quarters isn’t a dealbreaker for MSI because there are other things to like about this company: In the quarter ending May 1, 2025, MSI delivered 6% revenue growth and 13% non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the prior-year quarter. Amazon by the numbers: Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce retailer and the global market-share leader in cloud computing services. E-commerce delivers most of Amazon's revenue, but the higher-margin AWS cloud computing business provides higher operating income. AMZN stock is up 6.1% for the year after recovering from a dip from March through May. Over the past 12 months, AMZN has gained 28%. Amazon’s diversified business model has delivered revenue growth for years. Diluted EPS has been less consistent, but the 2024 result of $5.53 versus $2.90 in the prior year did make a statement. Based on announcements made in Amazon’s first quarter report, the company is firing on multiple cylinders. It's using AI to enhance the Amazon.com shopping experience as it expands the product set and geographic reach. The company is also growing its entertainment business and audience, with successful launches of Reacher Season 3 and LeBron James' Mind the Game podcast. And AWS is broadening its AI and computing capabilities as it secures new contract wins with premier customers like Adobe and Nasdaq. In the quarter ending on May 1, Amazon increased net revenue 9% and diluted 47.5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Mastercard Incorporated by the numbers: Mastercard processes digital payments in the U.S. and internationally. The per-transaction revenue model creates gains when spending across the Mastercard network increases or prices rise. Mastercard also has a growing services business encompassing security, marketing and other value-added services. MA stock is up 7.9% this year after two positive earnings surprises. Mastercard has the second-largest market share in U.S. credit card processing after Visa. According to Capital One Shopping, consumers charged $2.78 trillion to their Mastercards in 2024. Looking ahead, the outlook for consumer spending for 2025 is mixed, with some analysts predicting a slowdown in the second half. So far, Mastercard’s results show no signs of a spending slowdown. The company's last earnings report noted higher gross dollar volume and higher cross-border volume. Mastercard has also made strides diversifying its business model with initiatives like: Mastercard’s high operating margin in the upper 50s provides flexibility to pursue these and other growth initiatives. For the quarter ending on May 1, Mastercard reported constant-currency revenue and EPS growth of 17% and 15%, respectively. Disclosure: Author owns Microsoft stock. Microsoft by the numbers: Microsoft develops and maintains productivity software, sells cloud computing services and provides gaming hardware and content. MSFT stock is up 21.6% for the year after two positive earnings surprises and several analyst price target increases. Microsoft is the number two player in the cloud computing space, behind Amazon’s AWS. Modern platforms provide the environment for AI application development, training and deployment—so this high-margin space benefits directly from the AI revolution. It’s not surprising that Microsoft's ongoing investments in its cloud and AI offerings are driving profitable growth and substantial operating cash flow. The cash performance continues to provide the tech company with ample funding for growth initiatives and its modest dividend yield of 0.65%. (For higher-yielding dividend-payers, see best dividend stocks.) For the quarter ending on March 31, Microsoft reported constant-currency revenue and diluted EPS growth of 15% and 19%, respectively. Bottom Line High-flying growth stocks can produce quick gains in your portfolio—if you time things right. But because the stock market always has surprises on tap, make sure you're diversified and prepared financially for long holding periods. If you need help diversifying, see this list of best ETFs for 2025.

Title: Wall Street is finally embracing crypto—but the real payoff will come when it embraces DeFi

The global financial system, or what we broadly refer to as TradFi (Traditional Finance), is a $30+ trillion behemoth. Its reach spans commercial banking, global banking assets, insurance, capital markets, wealth management, and asset servicing. It touches every person, business, and institution, underpinning how value flows through the world. Meanwhile, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), despite being the most transformational innovation to hit financial services in decades, remains a mere rounding error in that picture. Depending on how you measure it, via Total Value Locked (TVL), DeFi token market cap, protocol revenue, or institutional activity, DeFi’s footprint barely scratches $150 billion on a good day. That’s less than half a percent of TradFi’s scope. This is not a failure. It is a testament to just how early we are. Seen more optimistically, it is an opening that holds the blueprint for the future of finance. Already, we’ve seen DeFi recreate core banking functions entirely on-chain, including borrowing, lending, insurance, trading, asset management, and structured products. And it’s working. Millions of users, thousands of developers, and hundreds of projects are coalescing around this future. DeFi’s growth, however, has been largely inward-looking, driven by crypto-native users rather than institutional money. And despite DeFi’s rapid-fire innovation, leading TradFi figures have mostly elected to watch from the sidelines, or worse, confine themselves to dismissive skepticism. This underscores the need for a bridge between the old and the new. TradFi must integrate with DeFi, not just observe it. Not to co-opt it, but to scale it. Fortunately, there is a precedent for such integration. Consider BlackRock’s game-changing embrace of Bitcoin ETFs in 2023–2024 (and later ETH). It didn’t just lend legitimacy, it unlocked institutional access at scale. Today, BlackRock has become the single largest TradFi driver of crypto adoption. It manages over $87 billion in spot Bitcoin ETF assets and $10 billion in ETH ETFs. BlackRock is also leading in DeFi-adjacent areas. Its BUIDL fund, a tokenized U.S. Treasury fund issued mostly on Ethereum via Securitize, holds over $2.4 billion, almost 10% of the $25 billion tokenized asset market on-chain. It’s a direct example of TradFi using DeFi infrastructure without compromising regulatory standards. Meanwhile, JP Morgan’s Kinexys division is working to bring financial assets on-chain. It has tested on-chain FX, repo, and tokenized bonds using permissioned DeFi liquidity pools. It is building infrastructure that mimics DeFi mechanics while staying within institutional compliance rails. This isn’t a crypto experiment; it’s the beginning of institutional DeFi. Then there is Fidelity, long known for its crypto-forward stance, which is quietly expanding its digital assets platform and exploring staking, custody, and tokenized financial products. It has the trust of pension funds and family offices—the very cohort most likely to embrace DeFi once it’s wrapped in a familiar product interface. Fidelity could lead by building regulated DeFi index products or permissioned vaults for clients. Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are also making moves with pilot projects to tokenize money market funds, with fast settlement and interoperability across digital networks. Goldman’s private blockchain and BNY’s LiquidityDirect are testing tokenized fund redemptions, a gateway to replicating DeFi yield mechanics inside TradFi. UBS, Citi, HSBC, and Standard Chartered have participated in tokenized bond issuances, on-chain settlement pilots, and custody infrastructure projects. These banks are particularly well-positioned to onboard emerging-market clients and sovereign wealth with DeFi-wrapped TradFi products. Not every TradFi sector, though, is equally ripe for a shift to DeFi. The two verticals where adoption is most likely to break through are the Asset Management and Treasury Markets, as well as the Securities Lending and Repo Markets. Tokenized treasuries, like BlackRock’s BUIDL, are just the beginning. Expect asset managers to create programmable yield products, combining DeFi vault strategies with real-world assets (RWAs). This is attractive for institutions sitting on large cash balances, because DeFi-native strategies offer higher yields and transparent collateralization. On the Lending and Repo side, DeFi can enable instant, auditable, and programmable collateral exchanges with reduced counterparty risk. JPMorgan’s experiments in tokenized repo trading are just the start. A permissioned version of Aave or Morpho could gain traction here. Just as crypto exchanges wrapped peer-to-peer transactions in slick UX, TradFi needs to wrap DeFi in user-friendly and compliant interfaces. That’s the blueprint for TradFi and DeFi collaboration. TradFi doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel. But it can add polish, regulatory clarity, and scale to existing DeFi primitives. Custodians can integrate liquid staking. Banks can offer tokenized money market funds on-chain. Asset managers can issue yield-bearing DeFi vaults with KYC wrappers. All of the ingredients are in place. For now, TradFi has the balance sheets and DeFi has the blueprints. The future belongs to those who build the bridge. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: New tariffs, alarming job numbers and a high-profile firing: A wild week for the Trump economy

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Tariffs putting the squeeze on businesses and consumers while bringing in billions of dollars for the United States government. A job market that is showing major signs of cracking even as the unemployment rate remains subdued. Tech stocks surging on Wall Street, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom — as many other sectors are ailing. As Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on social media earlier this week: “the Trump economy has officially arrived.” The past week was already primed to be a doozy for data, with investors and analysts eagerly anticipating updates about economic growth, jobs and the Fed’s latest interest rate decision. Major companies like Apple, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft reported their latest financial results. Trump’s deadline for trade deals was set for Friday. But what happened this week turned out to be more extraordinary than anyone expected. “I’m sending off red flares: We’re on the precipice of a recession,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, a financial research company. “If tariffs keep increasing, I don’t know how we avoid a recession.” Coming into this week, the U.S. economy had generally been considered in good shape despite mounting uncertainty and concerns about slowing growth. The week kicked off in Scotland with the announcement of a deal with the European Union that would set tariffs at 15%, ending months of uncertainty surrounding the United States’ largest trade partner. Trade talks then moved to Sweden, where leading officials from the U.S. and China held two days of negotiations. The talks yielded neither a deal nor a formal extension of the two countries’ trade truce, which will expire Aug. 12. “The meetings were very constructive,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters after the talks wrapped up. “It’s just that we haven’t given the sign-off.” Given the importance of trade relations between the world’s two largest economies, the cliffhanger meant the cloud of uncertainty created by Trump’s tariffs gambit persisted, despite some deals having been struck with other major trading partners including the European Union and Japan. Tuesday offered little reason for renewed optimism, with the international shipping giant UPS again declining to issue financial forecasts for the rest of the year, prompting investor concern about the impact of Trump’s shifting trade war and causing company shares to tank. Wednesday began with the Commerce Department reporting figures for second-quarter gross domestic product, or GDP, which measures economic growth in the U.S. The data showed an annual gain of 3%, beating expectations. But the same report also contained worrisome signs about business investment, even as price growth was accelerating. Later that day, the Federal Reserve announced it was keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged, in part due to those inflation concerns. That drew the ire of Trump, who has spent weeks hounding Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower the key lending rate. In remarks following the central bank’s announcement, Powell pointed to ongoing concerns about the potential for Trump’s tariffs to raise prices for U.S. consumers — but critically, referred to the jobs market as “solid.” Notably, two members of the rate-setting board — both appointed by Trump — dissented, the first time that has occurred in more than three decades. Blowout earnings from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta — two companies at the center of the AI investment boom, which is a key part of Trump’s domestic agenda — helped the stock market reach fresh highs early Thursday. Microsoft briefly became the second company to be worth more than $4 trillion on the stock market. Yet by the time the markets closed that day, stocks had erased their gains after Trump sent letters to more than a dozen pharmaceutical companies demanding they offer U.S. customers more competitive pricing for new medicines and giving them 60 days to comply. Late Thursday evening, Trump unveiled a sweeping new set of tariffs that unilaterally imposed higher import taxes on a host of trading partners, including allies like Canada and Taiwan. The new effective rate of more than 15% delivered a shock to global markets. The month closed with the Treasury Department reporting monthly tariff collections had hit another new record of more than $29 billion. In an interview with NBC News that evening, Trump touted the expansive new tariffs, saying he believed it all was going “very well, very smooth,” even as he remained open to new deals. Then Friday’s jobs report arrived. At 8:30 a.m., the Bureau of Labor Statistics published revisions showing sharply lower jobs totals for May and June than initially reported, while also finding the economy had added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. All told, it suggested the U.S. has gained an average of just 35,000 jobs a month over the past three months — and excluding the increases seen in the health care industry, the U.S. had lost more jobs than it had created. The unemployment rate, however, remained at 4.2%, a sign that overall joblessness remains subdued. However, many economists noted the data point is largely attributable to the president’s immigration crackdown, which is shrinking the overall labor force. The White House hailed the loss of foreign-born workers as it also noted a more sustained increase in the labor force among native-born workers. “If we’re swapping out foreign-born job holders for American-born job holders, I think that’s a win,” White House chief economic adviser Stephen Miran told Axios. He added that there was “really good reason” to believe the economy would improve, citing Trump’s trade deals and tax cuts. But for Trump, the public’s larger takeaway of a weakening labor market prompted an unprecedented response: Shortly after 2 p.m. ET on Friday, the president announced his intention to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics over what he said were errors in the jobs data, as well as accusations the agency had “manipulated” the numbers prior to the 2024 election. Neither allegation has been corroborated. The move sent shockwaves through Washington, with some experts warning it risked lowering the U.S. to the level of authoritarian regimes. “President Trump is once again destroying the credibility of our government by firing expert and nonpartisan officials because he does not like the facts that they present,” said Max Stier, the CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. “Governments that go down this path find themselves in ugly territory very quickly.” It was not clear whether the outgoing BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, a Biden administration appointee, would seek to challenge her removal in court. As it turns out, in addition to nominating a new head of the critical data agency, Trump will also get to name a new member to the Fed’s rate-setting board after Adriana Kugler, another Joe Biden appointee, unexpectedly announced her resignation late Friday. Both nominees still must be confirmed by the Senate, which remains narrowly controlled by the GOP. Asked if the White House continued to harbor concerns about the direction of the economy, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, issued the following statement: “In his first term, President Trump used an America First economic agenda to deliver historic working class prosperity and the first reduction in wealth and income inequality in decades. In his [second] term, President Trump is implementing the very same policy mix of deregulation, fairer trade, and pro-growth tax cuts at an even bigger scale — as these policies take effect, the best is yet to come.” That view is not shared among other economists. “All of this is troubling: a weakening economy, slowing labor market, rising inflation, rising tariffs, political influence on a statistical agency, more political influence on Fed, tensions with Russia & the onset of a market correction,” EY Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco wrote on X.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 02 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR.

Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 02 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 02 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

Title: I left my job in tech and moved to Spain. Being alone in a foreign country is hard, but it's changed me for the better.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/left-tech-moved-from-austin-texas-to-barcelona-spain-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-02T10:23:01Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Parrie Hartley, 30, who moved from Austin to Barcelona in February 2025. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. I'm from a really small town outside of Houston, where there are not a lot of employment opportunities. I've always been a city girl at heart, so in 2020, after a brief stint living in Australia, I moved to Austin and started working in software sales. Austin's tech scene is booming. Many, like big corporations, like Amazon, Tesla, and Meta, have opened offices there, bringing with them a lot of jobs. Moving there definitely built my career and made me a lot of money. Living in the city was awesome, too. It's a great place for young people, with an amazing culture, food, and music scene. There are a lot of events, and I definitely made some really great friends there. In May 2024, the startup company I was working for started making layoffs. By then, I had already started thinking about leaving Austin. I had been in the city for five years and was itching for a change. Everything in my life was perfect on paper, but I still missed adventure. I've always been very curious about the world, and I really do think I'm the best version of myself when traveling. At the time, I was 29 and single. I had no husband, job, children, or pets. My parents were healthy, so I didn't really have anything tying me down. I decided, "Why don't I move abroad?" I had been working in sales, so I had built up quite a bit in savings. But once I decided to move, I sold everything — furniture, clothes, anything that I could get money from. In Austin, I lived alone in a 1,100-square-foot apartment on the East Side, downtown, and paid $1,800 monthly on rent. To save money, I moved back to my hometown and started picking up some shifts at a local boutique. I considered a lot of different places to move abroad. I had already lived in Australia, so I checked that off the list. I'd also been to Asia, which I enjoyed, but I felt that living there might have been too much of a culture shock. So, I began researching visa options for Europe. One option was a student visa, which I discovered could be obtained by enrolling in a language school. The visa was available in Portugal, Spain, and Italy. As a Texan, I didn't feel a strong need to learn Portuguese or Italian. I had also visited Spain when I was 22, during a backpacking trip with friends to Barcelona, and had a great time. I figured that if I moved there, I could learn Spanish and be close to the other European countries I wanted to visit. It took about four weeks to organize all of my paperwork for the visa. I had to obtain an FBI background check, get a medical clearance from a doctor, show proof of health insurance, and submit my bank statements to show that I had sufficient funds in my account. In the end, everything came together, and my visa was approved just three days before my flight to Spain in February. I attend a Spanish language school called Expanish in Spain. I have classes five days a week, four hours a day. The course lasts 40 weeks, with eight weeks of holiday included. I paid $6,800 in total. I live in a neighborhood pretty close to the Church of La Sagrada Família , which is not only the most famous building in Barcelona, but possibly in all of Spain. Since I'm in such a central area, there are a lot of tourists and markets around, but the area itself is still fairly quiet. My building is between three major metro stations. Figuring out the metro was initially a challenge for me as an American, but it turned out to be super easy. I feel safe walking there day or night because the area has low crime. I got really lucky finding an apartment through a rental website called Idealista. They matched me with a couple, and I'm paying €600 ($686) for my room. I pay €10 ($11) a month for WiFi, plus water and electricity, which adds another €40 ($46) a month. The apartment is around 753 square feet and came fully furnished, which was great. We have air conditioning, but unfortunately, it doesn't reach my room, which is rough in the summer. Meeting people in Barcelona is easy, and the people are very warm and welcoming. The city is filled with people from all over the world. Most are away from their families, here for a year or two, so eventually, you end up creating your own little family. Often, making friends is as simple as going out and striking up a conversation — if you hear someone speaking English, you just start talking. I've met plenty of people through my language school, though it tends to be a revolving door since it's a temporary program, and most students are only around for three or four months. Outside of school, I've built friendships through Bumble BFF. I also joined a volleyball league when I first got here, and I play regularly. I haven't ventured onto the dating apps just yet. I'm 30, and I do want to build toward a relationship, but I feel like I need to get my life a bit more together first. That said, I'm definitely having fun meeting people. I've met guys from Brazil, the Netherlands, and Colombia — it's been a really fun mix. Honestly, it feels a bit like being a kid in a candy store. Most of my time here has been really positive. I spend a lot of time at the beach, and I'm walking up to 20,000 steps a day. You can really see the difference in my face. I've also been traveling. In July, I visited Menorca, one of the Balearic Islands off the coast of Spain. My round-trip flight was only €40 ($45.72). I just packed a backpack with bikinis and went. This month, I'm also heading to Mallorca because I scored free tickets to the Love Island UK finale. Right now, I earn money tutoring both kids and adults in English during after-school hours. I'm also helping my cousin, a lawyer in Texas, with some administrative work. My current visa is valid for one year and will expire in early February 2026. I'd love to stay longer, so I'm exploring the option of applying for a digital nomad visa. It's available in several European countries and essentially allows you to live and work remotely, as long as you meet certain income requirements and have health insurance. As for moving back to the US, I don't plan on it, at least not if I don't have to. Of course, there are cultural challenges that come with living abroad, especially in a place where you don't know the language or the people. I also miss my family, and get a little sad when I miss family events or big moments in their lives and can't be there in person. But I've come to realize that life keeps moving — both for them and for me. My motto is: you choose your hard. For me, marriage and raising a child right now would be difficult. For someone else, it might be moving overseas alone without knowing the language. But that's the kind of hard I'd gladly choose any day. Jump to

Title: Fed Could Slash Rates by 50 Basis Points in September After Weak Jobs Report, Says BlackRock Executive: Report

Time Published: 2025-08-02T09:15:07Z

BlackRock executive Rick Rieder reportedly thinks the U.S. Federal Reserve could slash rates by 50 basis points in September. Rieder, the asset management giant’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in a note to clients that Friday’s tepid jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics could convince the Fed to institute a larger cut than expected, according to a new report from CNBC. “If slack in the labor force builds at all, or we continue to see a below 100,000 jobs hiring rate persistently, we would expect the Fed to start moving rates lower, and a 50-basis point cut in September might be possible depending on how the data evolves.” The new labor report indicated total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 73,000 jobs in July, less than the Dow Jones estimate of 100,000. The CME FedWatch Tool, which generates probabilities using the 30-day Fed Funds futures prices, estimates there’s an 80.3% chance the Fed will cut the federal target rate by 25 basis points at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September, up from 37.7% on Thursday. However, the tool currently estimates there’s zero chance of a 50-basis-point cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference this week that no decisions have been made about September’s potential policy choices.

Title: Some strategists see a stock-market bubble brewing — and it's not the Magnificent 7's fault this time
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bubble-magnificent-seven-terrific-20-sp500-valuations-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-08-02T09:15:01Z
Full Content:
Stock valuations are getting frothy again, but this time, it's not all Big Tech's fault. Yes, valuations of the Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Tesla — are back up after since bottoming in April. Yet, the group's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is still down from mid-2024, mid-2023, and 2020 levels. Meanwhile, forward PE ratios on the next 20 stocks in the S&P 500 continue to surge, topping levels seen earlier this year. Their valuations are also higher than at any point over the last decade. Arun Sai, a senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, calls the group the "Terrific 20." Some may see the rising forward expectations for a widening number of stocks as a sign of health, as the rally extends beyond just the most popular stocks. But when stocks rise because of multiple expansion instead of earnings growth, it may be a sign that investor sentiment is becoming overheated. "These companies span a broad set of sectors more closely tied to the real economy, including financials, energy, industrials, consumer, and legacy tech," Sai wrote on Tuesday. "Names like Broadcom, Walmart, JPMorgan, Berkshire Hathaway, Visa, and GE Aerospace now account for ~17% of the MSCI US index, compared to 33% for the Mag 7." "Broader participation is a positive — when it's driven by earnings," he continued. "But when more of the market gets expensive, the narrative that 'US equities aren't overpriced, just a few exceptional companies are' becomes harder to justify." Sai compared the current environment to the so-called "Nifty Fifty" bubble in the 1960s. Richard Bernstein, the founder of Richard Bernstein Advisors and former chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, said in June that there are parallels to another famous episode of euphoria—the dot-com bubble of 2000—as the market seems solely focused on an emerging technology. On Wednesday, Bernstein reiterated his skepticism of the rally, noting that the market is still relatively concentrated even if valuations are surging among more than just the top seven stocks. Trading of leveraged ETFs, zero-day options, and low dollar-value stocks is also picking back up, signs of excess optimism, he said. "If you're a trader, I think you should take a deep breath and kind of look at what's going on and realize that everybody's in this huge speculative fervor," Bernstein told Business Insider. "But if you're an investor and you want to be a little patient, I don't think it gets much better than this." "The reckless abandon is going to leave you with so many opportunities," he continued. "It's going to be like post-2000." Most Wall Street strategists don't see a dramatic pullback ahead, and few have made direct comparisons to prior bubble episodes. In recent days, however, some have extended quiet warnings to investors about the market's near-term direction. Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note on Tuesday that "investors should be mindful of potential market swings in the coming weeks," and that "capital preservation or phasing-in strategies can be effective in navigating near-term volatility." While valuations are no doubt extended, there's no guarantee a major market top is near, and the AI trade may have room to run as the technology evolves. Meta and Microsoft, for example, reported strong earnings beats this week and gave positive forward guidance, causing shares to soar. Jump to

Title: Reasons to love Dublin right now: 52 of our favourite things about the city

Full Content:
Louis McNeice nailed it eight decades ago when he immortalised our capital city in his poem Dublin: “But yet she holds my mind/With her seedy elegance ... The glamour of her squalor, The bravado of her talk.” Ah, Dublin. The seedily-elegant city gets an awfully hard time these days. The housing crisis looms large, as do the apart-hotels springing up everywhere, not to forget the dilapidation that has always dogged our dirty old town. For years each winter, New York magazine has celebrated that city with its Reasons to Love New York Right Now edition. Inspired by them, we’re celebrating all that is great about Dublin. We know she has plenty of problems (scarlet for you, Temple Bar) but when we asked our contributors for examples of all that is brilliant right now about the capital we couldn’t hold them back: cultural happenings, community activism, remarkable watering holes, diverse food offerings and absurdities such as a few cherry tomatoes on a bridge becoming a bona-fide tourist attraction. We’re not blind to the city’s shortcomings (or overpriced pints) but what follows is a celebration of the capital in all her current glory. The magic, the mischief and the unexpected moments that make Dublin one of the best little towns in the world. So here are some of the many reasons why we love Dublin right now ... (With thanks to Róisín Ingle, Corinna Hardgrave, Una Mullally, Roe McDermott, Olivia Kelly, Conor Pope, Emer McLysaght, Deirdre McQuillan, Sorcha Pollak, Conor Capplis, Rebecca Daly, Niamh Browne, Joanne Cronin, Malachy Clerkin, Madeleine Lyons, Laura Slattery, Cathal O’Gara, Gemma Tipton and Ella Sloane). Because the Hacienda is holding out against gentrification. Shay is one of Dublin’s most beloved publicans. Always sporting an untied bow tie hung over a jazzy waistcoat and shirt, along with his signature coloured glasses, perhaps his greatest contemporary achievement is buttressing a unique bar from TikTok-loving tourists who confuse character with content. The pub – its exterior mimics a traditional Spanish cottage – has been there for decades in the market area between Capel Street and Smithfield. After you buzz the “bar” bell, and Shay cracks the iron-gated door, gives you the once over, and – if you’re lucky, or a regular – grants entry, inside you’ll find a magical pub stuck in time, with its nautical theme, pool tables, and a jukebox that always reverts to The Eagles. Intimate and lively, quaint and fun, it is also beloved by visiting artists looking for a down-to-earth spot to grab a pint, or to celebrate film premieres and arena tours (Taylor Swift booked it out for the after-party following her trio of concerts at the Aviva Stadium last summer). Sure, you can have a star on Hollywood Boulevard, but everyone knows that a framed photograph of you next to Shay on the wall of the Haci is the sign you’ve really made it. Now surrounded by apart-hotels, The Hacienda represents a space and attitude holding out against the homogenous corporate gentrification of the city. ... and the Cobblestone lives on. One of the great people’s victories in Dublin in recent years was the success of the Cobblestone protest. The pub – a bastion of traditional music, song, dance, and the Irish language – was threatened with a hotel development in 2021. Artists and audiences alike sprang into action, holding protests in Smithfield and at the headquarters of Dublin City Council. Planning permission ultimately refused; culture was one of the reasons cited. The energy of this successful protest speaks to the thriving traditional music scene in the city, from which many brilliant, boundary-pushing contemporary acts have emerged. Away from the din of amplified tourist-baiting live music in Temple Bar, you’ll still find authentic sessions in pubs across the city, and core to those is the Cobblestone. Because the Chamomile Club is proving Dublin can still be an exciting place for young artists. One of the most exciting collectives to come out of the city in recent years, the Chamomile Club encompasses parties, club nights, and music releases, featuring some of Ireland’s most exciting acts, including Monjola, Moio, and Aby Coulibaly. From block parties on Fade Street to garden parties at Orlagh House, and events at The Workman’s Club, The Complex, or other “secret locations”, their line-ups, design, and all-round energy is elevated and exciting. Other Dublin collectives, spaces and bands with a radical spirit include Dublin Digital Radio, Unit 44, and Bricknasty. Dublin is an expensive place to live, underserved with cultural spaces, and bigger cities are always calling. Yet these young artists and collectives are holding firm and inspiring others. Because the IFI and the Lighthouse are churches for film nerds. The seats are comfy, the coffee’s good, the staff are all delightful film nerds, and the foyers feel like somewhere you might accidentally meet the love of your life. Arthouse cinema in Dublin is alive and well, with the IFI hosting the Family Film Festival this August, while the Lighthouse’s programme is packed with the best new films as well as special screenings of classics like In The Mood For Love and Stanley Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon. Events like Cinema Book Club, GAZE and regular Q & As with writers and directors make these cinemas cultural hubs where no one will judge you for crying at a documentary about sheep. And if they do, they’re in the wrong cinema. Because pottery fever is catching in the Liberties. Nestled away on Mill Street in the Liberties, you’ll find a clay haven. Throwing Shapes is “the equivalent of Ballymaloe, but for clay,” says its founder Síofra Murdock, a ceramicist from Co Down who is as cheery and colourful as the pieces on display in her studio. Curious passersby can’t help but peer through the giant windows, plastered with bold red lettering – “Your Community Ceramics Studio” – to see what’s going on. It’s a hub of activity, hosting workshops, talks and markets that attract queues down the street. The shelves are lined with hundreds of creations, decorative and functional, at varying degrees of completion – some already fired and glazed, others still blank canvases. Having just celebrated its first birthday in May, the magnetic force of the studio grows stronger by the week. One member has even packed up and moved house to have the pottery wheels within arm’s reach. Murdock has hand-built a thriving clay community. Come and get your hands dirty. Because a Dublin storytelling event has gone global. Seanchoíche is a pop-up story telling night which encourages speakers to share personal anecdotes, prose, monologues, and spoken word. It gets its name from an amalgamation of seanchaíthe (the Irish for storytellers) and oíche (the Irish for night). The event, conceived in the Unesco city of literature, now runs in Belfast, Limerick, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Melbourne. The night recently ran a slot on the Greenpeace Stage at Glastonbury – and if it’s cool enough for Glasto, it’s cool enough for us. Because the Silent Book Club at Mish Mash Café is a balm for the overstimulated brain. Silent Book Club comes with no pressure, no awkward icebreakers, no demands. Just turn up, order a coffee, read your book. For an hour or two, people sit in a hush that feels unusually generous – alone, together. The only thing you have to bring is a book and maybe the unspoken hope that the world can still make space for quiet, slow, communal moments. For introverts, it’s heaven. For everyone else, it’s an excellent excuse to finally read that novel. Because it’s brilliant for live music. From blockbuster headliners like Taylor Swift at the Aviva and Bruce Springsteen at Croke Park, to up-and-coming Irish talent taking to the stage in the Academy or international indie acts playing the Olympia, Dublin easily pulls the live music weight of a city three times its size. It’s not just the venues themselves that are special, but festivals such as Kilmainham’s Forbidden Fruit and In The Meadows, to the propulsive dance beats of Longitude in Marlay Park. Catch emerging acts at smaller festivals like Whelan’s We’ve Only Just Begun and Workman’s Next Big Thing. Because we have the greatest (art) show on earth for free. In other capital cities people line up to pay admission to art galleries. In Dublin you can see Caravaggio, Vermeer (one of only 34 in the whole world) and more for absolutely nothing at the National Gallery. Or wander into the Hugh Lane, for their heart-soothing Impressionist collection, alongside the world-famous Francis Bacon Studio. Right now, Ailbhe Ní Bhriain’s hauntingly beautiful Dream Pool Intervals is on show there too, ending September 28th. Because our contemporary art museum is so much more. An art gallery you can do yoga at? Tick. Not only does the Irish Museum of Modern Art have a collection that’s jam packed with goodies (Daphne Wright, Dorothy Cross, Alice Maher – and that’s just for starters), their summer programme adds drop in yoga in the formal gardens on Wednesday lunchtimes and Thursday evenings all summer long. Add outdoor art films on Living Canvas, coffee in the courtyard, music and free workshops to get your arty buzz on and find out more at imma.ie. Did someone say art is stuffy, formal and elitist? Not in Dublin. Because a few cherry tomatoes on a bridge can turn into a tourist attraction. Nobody knows who started it. Nobody cares. What began last January as a few cherry tomatoes frozen during a cold snap on Binns Bridge in Drumcondra evolved into an unlikely tourist attraction. On Google Maps, it was known as “the Shrine of the Sacred Cherry Tomatoes of Drumcondra”. Locals and tourists flocked to pay homage with ketchup sachets, basil bouquets and, in one high-art twist, AI-generated portraits of tomatoes in tuxedos. Influencers filmed it. Poets wrote tomato-based tributes. The bridge, inevitably, got millions of views on TikTok. A tourist from Zimbabwe told one newspaper that while he’d been to see the Phoenix Park “so far my favourite thing is the Cherry Tomato Bridge”. “Rotten tomatoes,” complained the critics. “Salad days,” countered the fans. Either way, it captured something ephemeral about the communal absurdity to be found in Dublin. Dublin City Council Spoilsports Department were quick to clean it all up, but we’ll always have the memories. Because Dublin pub quizzes are the best craic. Every night of the week in Dublin there’s a Quizteam Aguilera or a Trivia Newton John vying for glory in the great leveller of social activities, the pub quiz. A good team name is almost more important than how you do. From The Woolshed on Parnell Street to Dudley’s on Thomas Street you’ll get more old favourites like Quiz Quiztofferson and Universally Challenged, along with some more local flavour like Let Quizty Take It or A Tráth Called Ceist. The weekly Wednesday quiz at The Circular in Rialto often sells out and combines friendly vibes, at least four dog mascots, and healthy rivalry between returning teams and newbies alike. Losers get whatever the host Colin McKeown bought earlier in the shop across the road, so even if the scores plummet there might be a Toffee Crisp in it for you. Colin runs Quiz Host Ireland and says it’s community that brings people back again and again: “Simply that we gather together and join a bigger group”. His favourite team name ever? “Padraig Pearsed Nipples.” Because sound Dubs still play along with the Viking Splash Tour. Those giant yellow second World War era amphibious vehicles trundle around the city, spitting facts about Dúbh Linn and pointing out that the Pepper Canister Church is so-called because it ... looks like a pepper canister. The favourite activity of the Viking Splash is creeping up on unsuspecting pedestrians to roar at them. It is the best of sports who pretends not to see them coming and then gets a “big fright” followed by a wave to all the marauders on-board. The Viking Splash has become so beloved in Dublin that when it appeared back on the streets after the Covid lockdowns it was taken as a positive sign that the city was healing. Spare a thought though for those who live or work along the route. It can’t be easy hearing those impassioned “aarrgghhs!” multiple times a day. Because soon you’ll be able to make free phone calls from a retro phone box in the Little Museum of Dublin. Newly reopened in its original home in a Georgian town house on the northside of St Stephen’s Green, the back yard of the Little Museum of Dublin will shortly be home to an old-school cream and green phone box. Once a familiar sight on Parkgate Street and later Dawson Street, the K1 phone kiosk is one of only two examples of this iconic phone box still left – the other is in Foxrock village where it’s a decorative suburban quirk that also houses a well-used book exchange. When the phone box lands in the museum in August it will become the only functioning K1 phone kiosk in the State. After a restoration project, Eir has donated the kiosk to the Little Museum ensuring that this piece of telecommunications heritage is safeguarded for future generations. Soon visitors to the museum will be able to experience the unique phone box and even, thanks again to Eir, make phone calls anywhere in Ireland for free. Because Dublin Zoo now has animatronic dinosaurs. The affection Ireland has for Dublin Zoo was evident in the concern many felt last summer when illness struck the elephant herd leaving two of the beloved beasts dead. It was also on display at the height of the Covid pandemic when people dug deep to fund food for the animals when the zoo was on its knees after months of lockdown. The zoo in 2025 is almost entirely unrecognisable from the one conceived in the Rotunda Hospital in 1830 when a group of medics and scientists formed the Zoological Society of Ireland. Back then it was largely for the entertainment of wealthy Dubliners, with the entrance fee set at a hefty six pence – or nearly €100 in today’s money. Sundays were for normal people – as long as they could afford to spend a single penny. Now spread over 28 hectares, the zoo attracts more than 1 million visitors a year as Ireland’s largest family attraction. And a day at the zoo got even better earlier this year when the 700 animals were joined by animatronic dinosaurs. Because Trinity College is an oasis in the bustling capital Right bang in the city centre you can step away from the busy streets into a 430-year-old college that is an oasis of tranquillity and architectural beauty. On a summer’s day you can even walk past the playing fields to the Pavilion Bar and sit on the steps outside watching the cricket (no understanding of the rules required). Because our seagulls think they own the place. They look down on us, they threaten our sandwiches, they play havoc with rubbish bags and poo on our cars. They cackle, they chortle, they screech and scream and yet Dublin wouldn’t be Dublin without seagulls. Bloom feeds them in Ulysses, one of several notable references to the birds in James Joyce’s novel. Dublin has the densest urban gull population in Ireland; they’ve been nesting in the city since the 1970s due to declining food sources at sea and closure of landfills – now estimated to number around 10,000 breeding pairs. Yet, despite this rise, the overall herring gull population in Ireland has dropped by 90 per cent in the past 30-40 years. As they tell us what we have done to our environment – and theirs – we should look up to them. Because the clip-clop of horses is still the soundscape of the inner city. Many cities have horse and carriage tours for tourists, but in Dublin, this goes much deeper. Caring for horses is an intrinsic part of the city’s culture – as well as Traveller culture – to this day. Around Dublin 7 and 8, it’s not uncommon to see young people walking horses through the streets, or trotting on sulkies. Concerns are often raised over animal welfare and the future of the Smithfield horse fair. But talk to a kid in the city with a horse by their side, and they’ll furnish you with plenty of details about the horse’s personality and how they care for them. If only the city could contribute more to enhancing the care of horses by providing new funding for stables, and acknowledging that this culture should be protected and supported with animal welfare as a priority. Because Dubliners can talk to anyone. There’s a particular magic in the Dubliner’s ability to talk absolute nonsense – and mean it. Not just weather chat, but miniature theatre: timing, wit, warmth. Whether it’s the butcher, the barista, or the person beside you on the 13, you’ll get a comment, a joke, a “will you look at that state of the sky”. It’s not meaningless – it’s micro-connection. People who deride the power of small talk are unaware of its important psychological benefits. Small talk – particularly those small chats you have with people you see regularly such as shopkeepers and regulars on your bus route – has been proven to promote a greater sense of safety, belonging and community. It’s not a coincidence that we are discussing loneliness and isolation at a time where people are more likely to put headphones on than say hi to your barista. Great small talk is a form of connection and it’s also a cultural skill we should be proud to protect and cultivate. Because “For All” groups are bringing communities together. Scores of volunteer and community groups have sprang up across Ireland in response to an increase in asylum seeker arrivals and anti-immigrant protests. In Dublin, many of these “For All” groups have evolved into a network of engagement for the wider community, says Roxanna Nic Liam, a member of the East Wall for All group. “These groups integrate not just asylum seekers, but locals who have been in the community for generations,” she says. “East Wall for All showed us how a working-class area in Dublin really does come together in a crisis and make the area a better place.” Liam Hourican of Dublin 8 For All says the group’s membership has rapidly grown following recent anti-immigrant protests outside two primary schools in Dublin 8. “People were disturbed by the rise of hateful narrative. We think an attack on marginalised members of our community is an attack on all our community.” Dublin 8 For All “makes our community richer”, says Hourican. “This is what our country should be about – we should be open and confident and kind to each other.” Because Dublin keeps showing it solidarity with Palestine. Dublin has long been a focal point for protest and activism in Ireland, and over the past year, it has become a powerful centre for solidarity with Palestine. From the Garden of Remembrance to the gates of Leinster House, tens of thousands have taken to the streets. Palestinian flags hang from shop windows, business awnings and private homes, a sign of collective outrage and empathy. This surge in solidarity is part of a broader, deeply rooted activist spirit in Dublin, where people have repeatedly gathered to reshape Ireland’s national identity, from the Repeal the 8th movement to the Marriage Equality referendum. The same streets that once echoed with calls for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ equality now resound with chants for justice in Gaza. Because Capel Street is Dublin’s best car-free street. You can keep Grafton Street and Henry Street. Not only is Capel Street longer, it is distinctly better suited to exploit the advantages of a traffic-free environment because it has what the others lack – pubs and restaurants. Retail-dominated Grafton Street and Henry Street are dead once the shops close, but life continues into the evening on Capel Street, pedestrianised in 2022, particularly in summer when people can dine outdoors. During the day, the new public seating is well-used by shoppers taking a rest, teenagers socialising, tourists checking out what their next destination should be, and workers availing of an outdoor space to have lunch. Instead of car fumes and the noise of traffic, now there is the sound of conversation. Instead of pedestrian safety being compromised by vehicles, now there are plants to enjoy. ... followed by Parliament Street. Facing Capel Street across Grattan Bridge, bookended by the Liffey and City Hall, tree-lined Parliament Street was pedestrianised in July. The removal of traffic has the potential to rebalance Temple Bar, drawing more tourists from the busier east end to the West. It is also a big gain for cycling, with a new contraflow lane on Grattan Bridge allowing cyclists to go in both directions from City Hall on Dame Street, along Capel Street and all the way to Bolton Street – a distance of almost 1km. Because the quays are no longer a traffic choked hellscape. Described as a “watery dual carriageway” by Dublin City Council’s head of traffic Brendan O’Brien, the quays served no one – not cyclists, not pedestrians, not bus users, not even the private car drivers who were the largest contributors to its congestion. That has changed. Last summer the council banned private cars and commercial vehicles travelling along the Liffey at either side of O’Connell Bridge from 7am to 7pm. City car parks remained accessible, no Liffey bridge was closed to cars, and once 7pm hit, it was back to the status quo. Yet this one small measure had a transformative effect on traffic. The provision for cyclists is still poor, but the big winners are Dublin’s bus users. Rush hour bus journey times fell by almost a third and timetable accuracy increased. Some motorists still ignore the restrictions, but hopefully the planned introduction of traffic light cameras will sort them out. Because slowly, surely, soul-enhancingly, our city is becoming greener. As the cycleways and pedestrianised areas have expanded, so too have little pockets of green. Whether it’s more trees along the new cycle paths in North Strand or vertical planting out of the bases of old brick walls in the Liberties or St James Linear Park running along the Luas red line in Rialto, these are imaginative, in many cases inexpensive, interventions that go a long way to softening the city’s rougher edges. Cabra is full of brilliant examples such as the Community Roots garden-sharing initiative which matches people who want to grow their own food with others who have space and are happy to share. Then there’s the Cabra Pond, built without a pond liner using bentonite clay, has transformed the area behind the Most Precious Blood Church off Kilkieran Road. The pond is full of tiny frogs at the moment with plenty of swifts soaring overhead – boxes for the birds were organised by Connecting Cabra. Catriona Kenny, a member of that group, says local churches have been generous with their land: “We’ve held biodiversity festivals there, and planted long flowering meadows, native hedgerows and even a mini orchard. A local flood-alleviating project is ongoing around Christ the King Church, to reduce pressure on our storm drains.” Well played, Cabra. Because our traffic junctions have become public works of art. It all started 10 years ago as part of the Dublin Canvas community art project. Artists were asked to come up with ideas for painting over the grey, and much graffitied, traffic light control boxes with all manner of eye-catching art. These brightly painted boxes bring welcome flashes of creativity and colour to otherwise boring bits of street furniture at most junctions throughout the city and suburbs. With another batch commissioned for painting over the coming months, there will be more than 900 spread out across Dublin by autumn. Because our walls talk back. Street artists like Joe Caslin and Emmalene Blake make the city feel alive. Caslin’s soaring portraits – of queer teens, grieving men, hopeful change – don’t just beautify walls, they demand tenderness. Emmalene Blake’s work started with portraiture and has now become more political: hand-painted girls, mothers, and martyrs who quietly reclaim space for care, queerness, and Palestine. In a city often accused of being scrubbed of character, these artists murals remind you what still matters, responding to social crises and political events in real time, turning empty space into activism and concrete into feeling. You look up, and suddenly the city’s talking back. Because people sit anywhere, anytime, anyhow. The provision of public seating in some areas of the city is finally improving, but elsewhere, Dubliners still have to take a load off by sitting on the street, as they have always done. Back in the day, the steps of the Central Bank were where young people gathered, and an ecosystem of subcultures merged; ravers, rockers, goths, grunge heads, skaters, and emo kids. Then it was the steps of the Powerscourt Shopping Centre on South William Street. While the banks of the canals and the boardwalk are well-worn sitting spots, now it’s the kerbs of Drury Street, Castle Market and Fade Street where you’ll find the city’s cool kids hanging out. (The pedestrianisation of South William Street remains in limbo; this could revitalise a street that was once buzzing, but is now pockmarked by vacancy.) Because the Clontarf to city centre cycleway is glorious. Since the early 1990s cyclists heading north from Clontarf have had a traffic free path to enjoy the fabulous vista of Dublin Bay opening up before them, until, that is, they were chucked out unceremoniously at the Wooden Bridge to contend with traffic for a 2km stretch. In 2017 this missing link in the cycle-path was filled in and all was well, unless you were a cyclist heading south from Clontarf, then you were left to dice with death all the way into town. But no more. Last November the Clontarf to city centre cycle route opened. This 2.7km route takes cyclists all the way from the end of the Clontarf promenade to Conolly Station on Amiens Street, but more than that, it offers connections, existing and planned, to a whole network of safe segregated cycle routes. Already cyclists can use it to join the Royal Canal Greenway at Newcomen Bridge and Dublin Port’s new Tolka Estuary Geenway via Fairview Park. In future, the route will be extended from Amiens Street down to the Liffey side paths and one day, if the council implements its Sandymount Strand Road plans, it will be connected to the southside and eventually the long-awaited Sutton to Sandycove (S2S) cycle-path along Dublin Bay could be completed. Because the new S bus routes offer a whole new way to explore the city. Rather than follow the old centripetal pattern of draining humanity into the city centre where people often had to hop off and hop on another bus to get where they wanted to go, the new S buses run across the city. The S2 for example goes from Heuston Station to Sandymount, through the city centre. ... and everyone still thanks the bus driver when getting off. Even if people now have to disembark via the middle doors, they still shout “thanks” up to the driver. And unless you’re wielding a knife the drivers almost always let you travel even if you don’t have change or didn’t know they don’t take e-payments (in this day and age!). Because sea swimming is now a religion with better robes. Irish people have a deep relationship with the sea; we turn to it as a form of escape, of calm, of emotional regulation. Whether you’re partial to Seapoint, Bull Wall, the Forty Foot or Vico Baths, there’s no such thing as off-season: the sea is always there for you. And even if you go alone, there’s a sense of community in being one of the mad ones who embraces the cold at any time of year. The reasons vary – mental health, community, a daily dopamine hit – but the feeling is universal: euphoria, followed by a hot flask of tea and a smug glow that lasts all day. ... and you can swim beside Moglaí Bap from Kneecap at Clontarf Baths. Swimming outdoors in Dublin with the reassurance of a seawater filter was a weirdly impossible dream until relatively recently, but this joyfully jellyfish-free option is now available at Clontarf Baths (€10 for two hours, clontarfoutdoorpool.com). Originally built in the 1880s, the baths reopened after a 22-year hiatus in 2018, initially only for swimming club members, before public sessions were added in 2022. The pool tends to be a few degrees warmer than actual sea temperature, though it might not feel that way if you brave it outside the summer months. With its expansive dimensions, it is an invigorating, open secret swim spot. Moglaí Bap from Kneecap presumably agrees – he was spotted enjoying the baths when the band were in town for their gig at Fairview Park in balmy June. Because saunas have become the new pubs. Forget meeting people for a meal or a drink, the new way to socialise is by sweating together in a sauna, with new ones opening in recently in almost every Dublin postcode, from Killiney to Swords, Dundrum to Ballsbridge. One of our favourites is the Hot Box Sauna in Inchicore, an area recently named as one of the coolest neighbourhoods in the world by Time Out. Because there’s a run club for everyone. Dubliners are embracing new ways of socialising and boosting their health while they are at it, and with a great selection of parks and walkways, it seems only natural. From singles, to gaeilgeoirs to members of the LGBTQ community to asylum seekers, there’s a run club to suit all interests, whether you’re looking to train for a marathon or simply jog 5k; some of the most popular include Sanctuary Runners, Dublin Front Runners, Sole Mates, Run Club Social and Club Reatha. Because Gay Spar is still the best place to feel seen at 2am. Officially known as the Spar on Dame Street, unofficially known as Gay Spar, this 24-hour convenience store is also a safe haven. So-called due to its proximity to The George, “Gay Spar” started as a nickname – but the shop has wholeheartedly embraced it, with windows now emblazoned with rainbow Pride colours. When you stumble in after the club, before the taxi, when your eyeliner’s smudged and your voice is hoarse, you can be safe in the knowledge that you’re not the only glitter-covered person buying a Lucozade and a sausage roll. At a time where corporate LGBTQ+ allyship – no matter how performative – is being rolled back worldwide, Gay Spar has proven to be a steadfast ally. Because some shops are more than just shops. Around the city, independent stores add to the diversity of retail, breaking up the monotony of international chains. Many of these brick-and-mortar stores also act as cultural hubs. Saint Street hosts sessions by local rappers. Emma Fraser’s vintage clothing stores Loot and Nine Crows have expanded into an internationally lauded modelling agency Not Another Agency. Tola Vintage hosts Culture Night parties, and High Rollers has a skate team. At Indigo & Cloth’s micro-cafe, actors, artists, playwrights and crew from the nearby Project Arts Centre grab a brew. Emporium collaborates with the club Index and the record label Soft Boy, home to Kean Kavanagh and Kojaque. Owner of Little Deer Comics Matthew Melis is founder of the Dublin Comic Arts Festival. What all these stores have in common is an independent spirit, a can-do attitude, and a belief that community is what makes a city business tick. Because Stable and The Irish Design Shop are beacons of Irish design. If there’s one shop in Dublin city centre that lifts the spirits in an otherwise mediocre line up of global fashion brands found in any European capital, it is Stable in the Westbury Mall. Founded by friends Sonia Reynolds and Frances Duff originally as a pop-up ten years ago, it celebrates its ongoing success in promoting Irish craftsmanship and native fabrics, designing and making scarves, clothing and home accessories using Irish linen, tweed and handwoven wool. For crafts and jewellery, The Irish Design Shop on nearby Drury Street can’t be beaten. Because indie bookshops are still holding the line. In Books Upstairs, you can climb the stairs to a cafe filled with poetry books and political theory. In The Gutter Bookshop, the staff recommend novels with such genuine joy it feels like a gift. In Hodges Figgis, a 300-hundred-year-old institution, you can still overhear a teenager discovering Sylvia Plath. The best ones – like The Library Project in Temple Bar, with its photo books and zines – remind you that books aren’t just stories, they’re worlds, and Dublin still has places where you can stumble into them. Events like Rick O’Shea’s Writehawks, which allows writers to come in and chat about their favourite books, create a sense of community. Because the George’s Street Arcade is as odd as ever. Where else could you get a nipple pierced and your fortune told before picking up a kaftan, some handcrafted statement jewellery, a batter burger and an oat-milk latte, all under the one roof? Only in Ireland’s first purpose-built shopping centre. While it’s unlikely the youth of the 1880s – when the George’s Street Arcade first opened its doors – were lining up to get body parts pierced or inked, they were no doubt as drawn to the eclectic mix of stalls and shops as more recent generations have been. And sure as anything they used it as a handy and dry shortcut when walking from George’s Street to Drury Street on a rainy day. The closure of Simon’s Place is still mourned by many, but the arcade continues to be a draw for tourists and locals. Because Kish Fish reminds us what food shopping should be like. Kish opened on a back street in the heart of Smithfield in 1979 when Ireland loved the pope and the notion of north inner-city gentrification was as comically unlikely as a computer company paying us €13 billion in back tax or some class of silicon docks popping up at the back of Irishtown. The fishmongers standing behind the beds of tightly packed ice are old-school and fiercely obliging, happy to fillet and skin whatever takes your fancy and teach you how best to cook it. You won’t find that service in many supermarkets. Because of the second-hand treasure troves. Dublin’s street style is a combo of Pellador jumpers and Claddagh ring emblems, mixed with second-hand finds uncovered in the city’s charity and vintage shops – from the legendary Lucy’s Lounge in Temple Bar and Monto on Parnell Street, to the newer Big Smoke Vintage in Temple Bar. As for the “chazzas”, Dublin has a wonderful selection of shops that follow each other like stepping stones, from Capel Street to George’s Street, Camden Street and into the southside. Because the flea market scene keeps offering new treasures. In 2018, the Dublin Flea Market ceased trading due to redevelopment around Newmarket Square, much to regret of locals and fans of a good bargain. But residents were delighted to welcome the revived Newmarket Flea in July. Elsewhere in the city, Quirk, Le Zeitgeist, Libertine Market Crawl, Flux Market and the Block Market in Charlemont Square have all helped turn thrifting into a social event. Flea markets are a haven of creativity and community, showcasing the best of local artists, crafts and vintage fashion collectors. It’s not just about finding something rare and engaging in a spirit of sustainability as old items become loved again, it’s about chatting to the sellers, grabbing a coffee, and seeing what strange treasure finds you. Because Change Clothes offers us a guilt-free wardrobe refresh while saving clothes from landfill. In 2022, Mary Fleming set up Change Clothes in Crumlin, initially a one-week pop-up devoted to clothes swapping, workshops and exhibitions. Fast forward to 2025 and Mary’s word is spreading far and wide across Dublin. Now based on Thomas Street in Dublin 8, Change Clothes hosts clothes swaps, fill-a-bag events, sewing machine classes and textile upcycling events. Donated clothing is redistributed to people in need, and traineeships are offered to those looking to get started in the textile industry. Change Clothes also enables other social enterprises to host clothes swaps events by providing clothes rails and the know-how. Because the city finally knows how to eat. There was a time when “going out for food” in Dublin meant soggy panini or bafflingly expensive Caesar salads. Not any more. From Filipino adobo tacos to cardamom cruffins to smoked fish toasties made in tiny food trucks, the capital’s kitchens are having a golden age. There’s imagination, care, spice. Pop-ups and wine bars. Places you tell your friends about immediately, unless you want to keep them to yourself. It’s not just fancy spots – it’s the fact that Dubliners now expect their food to taste of something. And it does. New favourites include Little Lemon on Duke Lane, Pickosito on Mary Street, Fidelity in Smithfield, Lupillos in Inchicore, and Cat You Café in Ringsend for the best acai bowl in town, as well as the global streetfood stalls at the recently opened Priory Market in Tallaght. Because Assassination Custard is defying the odds. In a city where independent restaurants are being flattened by rent hikes and global roll-outs, and Dublin dining has blurred into velvet booths, TikTok interiors and menus written by accountants, Ken Doherty and Gwen McGrath’s Assassination Custard in Dublin 8 remains a quiet act of resistance. Opened in 2015, it shut in July 2023 to reassess how – or if – it could go on. It reopened in February, reshaped but not softened: bookings open weekly on Instagram, lunch Wednesday to Friday, with two sittings, 12pm and 1.30pm. Bookings are for one or two people, dining at shared tables, maximum eight people. It’s €35 a head minimum (less if solo). Now serving wine: one red, one white, and a vermouth at €8.50 a glass. The paper-bag menu shifts with the season and their format: always vegetarian options, often offal – tripe, kidneys, hearts – and pickles, ferments, anchovies, and pig’s ear. No PR machine. Two cooks, three tables, and a welcome that proves why small matters. Because Green Man Wines is one of the best wine shops in the world. Rajat Parr – the world’s most revered blind-taster – walked into Green Man Wines in Terenure and, like every wine nerd, did a double take. More than 1,000 lines, from smaller producers who farm organically, biodynamically, “naturally”. Wines with energy, not funk. Most fall into the €20-€40 range, though there are four-figure unicorns. Opened a decade ago by Dave Gallagher and his wife, the late Claire O’Boyle Gallagher, it still reflects their mix of obsession and warmth. All bottles can be opened on-site for €15 corkage. Dan Smith, formerly of Airfield Estate, is the chef in the wine bar (Thursday-Saturday), serving a rotating menu, built around small plates that pair with the wine. “Wine Tasting Wednesdays” bring visiting winemakers pouring their bottles, with Dan riffing on the regional food. Because the world’s best chefs treat Fish Shop like a local. The Smithfield room is tiny – two marble-topped counters, 15 stools, a chalkboard menu, and a killer wine list: Jura whites, grower Champagne, alpine Nebbiolo, island wines from the Med. Peter Hogan and Jumoke Akintola opened Fish Shop here in May 2016, following their Blackrock Market stall. The menu still includes their renowned fish and chips but has quietly grown. The rule remains: wild, Irish-caught fish and seafood only. No tuna, bream, sea bass, imported prawns. Grilled John Dory or brill are mainstays, alternatives include gurnard or red mullet. Shellfish from the Copper Coast – crab, shrimp, lobster, whelks – are delivered from Tramore by Peter, and Irish langoustines or tiny seasonal shrimp, depending on the catch. Famous chefs eat here, of course. International names, tipped off about our restaurant critic Corinna Hardgrave’s favourite casual restaurant in Dublin. Good luck getting a seat. Because the Mushroom Butcher is Dublin’s most original pop-up. Mark Senn, a Melbourne-born chef who once ran the short-lived Veginity and Vish, now grows and cooks mushrooms near Leonard’s Corner in Dublin 8. Mushroom Butcher is his Saturday-only food truck – parked outside a converted retail unit where he and his partner, Ingrid Baceviciute, cultivate a dozen or so delicate, short-shelf-life mushroom varieties rarely seen in Ireland. Staples have included king oyster schnitzel, mushroom XO sauce with polenta chips, and a vegan bánh mì, and more recently, he’s featured a series of themed menus – Brazilian, Japanese, Greek and Italian – all cooked to order. The mushrooms themselves are sold fresh and appear on menus at some of the country’s best restaurants. No delivery. Just a hyper-focused weekly service that’s growing something new – literally, from the ground up. Because Al Khair restaurant at the mosque on South Circular Road is an escape to another culture. At Al Khair, the canteen-style restaurant tucked behind the blue gates of the mosque on South Circular Road, hospitality means food – shared, abundant, unforgettable. Opened in 1985 by Mohammed Yousuf, now run by his son Junaid, the food is what he calls Indian with a “gentle Pakistani influence”, which in practice means you get the creamy warmth of paneer and dal, the deep spice of slow-cooked lamb, and the slap-you-awake heat of aubergine bharta when you ask for it spicy. The vegetarian samosas are wonderful. Because the new generation of cocktail bars rival the best in the world. When Dave Mulligan felt the city needed some old school night-time glamour, he reimagined the old Sackville Lounge off O’Connell Street. This old boozer still has that classic Dublin pub feel, but it’s also new and sleek with a cocktail menu that will knock your socks off. But what else would you expect from head bartender Dave Taylor, who also oversees operations at nearby award-winning Bar 1661? This year, Bar 1661 represented the Irish cocktail scene at the prestigious Tales of the Cocktail in New Orleans, showcasing all that is great about Irish spirits and Irish drinks. Because of the secret table in Pepper Pot Café. Most Dubliners know about the pear and bacon sandwich in the Pepper Pot Cafe. (If you don’t, and think pear and bacon come across as unlikely breadfellows, just try it.) Most of us also know the Pepper Pot is one of Dublin’s best cafes for people watching, on the balcony in the Powerscourt Townhouse Centre overlooking the bustling hordes below. But our favourite place to perch is at the table we like to call the secret table. In a room away from the main seating areas, it’s where the cafe’s baking magic happens. Here you can eat your pear and bacon or equally lovely sausage sandwich while watching croissants being laminated and bagel dough being pulled. Now, like Doris Day’s secret love, our secret table’s no secret any more. But that’s okay. We don’t mind sharing. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Five things investors should ponder on crypto

A decade ago half a dozen mavericks assembled in a Swiss house to launch ethereum – a piece of the crypto ecosystem that acts as a distributed computing platform, using the ether token. It initially looked likely to fail: the founding tribe imploded after bitter internal fights; ethereum suffered a large cyber hack; scandals erupted and, like bitcoin, ether’s price became crazily volatile, surging from nothing to $5,000, before collapsing. But this week something striking occurred: just as the White House was issuing a report about the Golden Age of Crypto, the Nasdaq exchange celebrated ethereum’s 10th birthday. “Ethereum has demonstrated itself ... as the definition of antifragile,” enthused Joe Lubin, one former inhabitant of that founding house, who presents the platform as “a reliable trust layer for our fast-growing digital world”. Cynics will undoubtedly wince in horror, while enthusiasts will cheer. No wonder: crypto is arguably the single most divisive issue in finance today. [ Crypto investors need more detailed warnings about risks involved - Central BankOpens in new window ] However, I would suggest that this anniversary should spark a more realistic – and subtle – judgment. For the past decade has revealed at least five key points about crypto that investors should ponder. First, and most obviously, digital assets are not homogenous (even if detractors hate them all). Bitcoin is a one-dimensional phenomenon that fans liken to “digital gold”, while ethereum is a multifaceted infrastructure. Memecoins (like $TRUMP) only float on crazy hype, but stablecoins are supposed to be backed by assets, like treasuries. This matters. Second, we need to move beyond black-and-white thinking with crypto. The evangelists who declared a decade ago that distributed finance would transform the world were wrong – thus far digital assets are still too clunky, costly and energy-guzzling to displace most mainstream payment options, and too volatile to be a reliable store of value. Criminality has been rife. Just think of the saga of Sam Bankman-Fried, or regulatory censure of the tether stablecoin. But doomsayers who predicted crypto’s demise were equally wrong. Digital asset prices have just soared (again), pushing ethereum and bitcoin’s market capitalisation up to $455 billion (€398.6 billion) and $2.3 trillion respectively. And the $270 billion-odd worth of stablecoins in circulation are supported by as many transactions as the Visa credit card network in the last year, as Glenn Hutchins, a long-time tech investor, tells me. Why? Greed (or speculation) is one factor. But crypto is founded on an interesting innovation (blockchain) that can sometimes be useful (say, for some cross-border payments). Moreover, some key players and regulators are raising standards in response to past scandals and networks like ethereum are slashing energy usage. [ A lesson from The Godfather as Wall Street backs crypto assets it once dismissed as a ‘fraud’Opens in new window ] Third, mainstream finance is moving in. This is ironic, given that early crypto evangelists promised that distributed finance would depose incumbents. But it is driving the current boom. Consider the fact that a top BlackRock executive has just joined an ethereum investment group; or that traditional asset managers like Fidelity, BlackRock and Vanguard are launching crypto funds; or how mainstream investors are increasingly using crypto as a diversification play, while banks such as JPMorgan are running their own blockchains and launching stablecoins. Fourth, the geopolitics of crypto are shifting – fast. In the past decade, most innovation occurred outside the United States, in places such as Hong Kong. But this week Paul Atkins, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he wanted to pull it onshore. Why? One reason is that the Trump family itself is invested in crypto. Another is grubby politics: crypto groups were such big Trump donors in 2024 that luminaries tell me they won the election for him. But geofinance matters too. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent hopes that dollar-based stablecoins will create a new source of demand for treasuries, and promote more dollar usage around the world. Consider this a new policy twist on Bretton Woods in the Silicon Valley age. Finally, crypto’s second-order effects could turn out to be even more striking than the digital assets themselves. For what the innovation does is enable us to imagine alternatives to the financial and geopolitical status quo – for instance, by asking if we need to rely on the Swift payment system, or dollar dominance. Don’t get me wrong: by making these five points, I am not downplaying the risks. The Trump administration’s conflicts of interest with crypto are shameful. The potential for consumer harm is real. There are financial stability risks due to crypto’s growing links with mainstream finance, and the use of treasuries to back stablecoins. Criminality and grift exists. But it is possible to worry about these risks – and want better regulation – but at the same time to recognise that the underlying technology can be useful as a geopolitical and financial diversification tool. For these reasons, ethereum’s “birthday” should prompt enthusiasts and doomsayers alike to realise that neither of them is entirely right. Life is rarely black and white – in finance or anywhere else. That will not change even if (or when) ethereum turns 20. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Economic Reality Bites Trump and His Protectionist Trade Policies

Georg Riekeles knows about hardball trade negotiations: during the long and arduous talks about the terms on which Britain would leave the European Union, he was an adviser to Michel Barnier, the E.U.’s chief negotiator. Back in April, when Riekeles saw that President Donald Trump issued an order, which was subsequently suspended, imposing blanket tariffs of twenty per cent on E.U. exports to the United States, he had a clear view on how the Europeans should respond: by threatening hefty duties on U.S. exports to Europe. This was what China had done, and it seemed possible that America’s other major trading partners would join together to force Trump to relent. “What was needed was for the E.U. negotiators to prepare a broad retaliatory package,” Riekeles, who is now an associate director at the European Policy Center, a Brussels think tank, told me this week. The E.U. did hit back by imposing hefty duties on some iconic U.S. goods, including Kentucky bourbon and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Subsequently, it threatened to expand the levies to U.S. aircraft, car parts, and certain other products. But, in the end, it held back from threatening Trump-style blanket tariffs and invoking the E.U.’s new Anti-Coercion Instrument, a policy tool that was introduced in 2023 to deal with external economic pressure, which would have enabled it to target U.S. banks and tech giants, such as Google and Meta, which have huge businesses in Europe. Referring to the E.U. leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, Riekeles said, “They never got going on a really punitive package.” At the start of this week, the White House announced a one-sided framework agreement in which most European goods that enter the United States will face a levy of fifteen per cent. The announcement said that the E.U. had agreed to eliminate all tariffs on U.S industrial goods, invest six hundred billion dollars in the United States, and greatly increase its purchases of U.S. energy products and military equipment. “This is a pretty disastrous outcome—a capitulation and a humiliation all in one,” Riekeles said. “The E.U. leaders didn’t take the full measure of Trump’s trade policies and what his Presidency is about.” In Trump’s telling, of course, his goal is to revive American manufacturing, reduce the trade deficit, and raise revenues. Last month, as the stock market hit new highs and some economic indicators were suggesting that the economy as a whole was holding up surprisingly well under his tariff onslaught, he wrote on social media. “The Fake News and the so-called ‘Experts’ were wrong again. Tariffs are making our Country ‘BOOM’.” A series of economic reports that were released this week illustrated the emptiness of Trump’s claims. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department released figures showing that during the first half of 2025 G.D.P. growth slowed sharply compared with last year. Frantic efforts by businesses and consumers to front-run Trump’s tariffs by ordering foreign-produced goods before the levies took effect have distorted the quarterly G.D.P. figures, which show the economy contracting at an annualized rate of 0.5 per cent from January to March and growing at a seemingly healthy rate of three per cent between April and June. If you combine the figures to correct for the distortions, they show G.D.P. expanding at a rate of 1.3 per cent during the past six months, compared with 2.8 per cent in 2024. That’s a big drop. Given all the uncertainty created by the chaotic rollout of Trump’s new tariff regime, it’s hardly surprising that employers have been thinking twice about hiring workers. The official employment report for June, which was released a month ago, showed weakness in many private-sector industries, but the over-all scale of the slowdown wasn’t clear until the July report came out, on Friday. Leaving aside seasonal farm labor, employers created seventy-three thousand new positions last month, a smaller number than Wall Street was expecting. But the real shocker came in the revised estimates for May and June, which showed that job growth fell to below twenty thousand in each month. That amounts to a virtual standstill. Taking the last three months as a whole, employment growth has been weaker than in any comparable period since the covid-19 pandemic. Trump’s initial response to the jobs report was to renew his attacks on the Federal Reserve, and its chair, Jerome Powell, for not acceding to his demands for a cut in interest rates. “Powell is a disaster,” he wrote on Truth Social immediately after the job figures were released. Later in the day, again on Truth Social, Trump announced that he was firing the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the monthly employment report. In another post, he sought to justify this unprecedented step by claiming that the July job figures had been rigged to make him and other Republicans look bad. The reality is that the B.L.S. is staffed by statisticians and other data experts, many of them career public servants, who go to great lengths to produce accurate figures. Even by his standards, Trump’s effort to find a scapegoat was pretty pathetic. As for the Fed, which held its benchmark interest rate steady at a policy meeting earlier this week, it isn’t responsible for the fact that many firms are responding to Trump’s tariffs by holding off on hiring and starting to raise their prices. Another economic report released this week showed the rate of inflation, as captured by the Fed’s preferred metric, edged up to 2.6 per cent in June, from 2.4 per cent in May. That means inflation is still above the Fed’s two-per-cent target, and it points to a possible return of stagflation, in which price rises accelerate at the same time that the economy stagnates. At times, Trump and his economic advisers have suggested that it may be a worthwhile trade-off for the economy to suffer some short-term pain in exchange for raising tariffs and bringing down the trade deficit, which in four of the past five years has totalled more than three per cent of G.D.P. Although this argument seems to make some intuitive sense, it’s hard to back up empirically. “The data shows there is just no relationship between trade balances and tariffs.” Joseph Gagnon, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in Washington, told me. The Trump policy agenda “is based on a mistaken premise,” Gagnon added. One way that Trump’s tariffs could bring down the trade deficit, which is the gap between exports and imports, is by eventually knocking the economy into a full-on recession. But, if this happens, the narrowing in the gap won’t have anything to do with removing foreign trade barriers: it will be because American consumers and businesses have less money to spend on everything, imported goods included. As Americans wait nervously to see whether this is the future awaiting them, many people in other countries are coming to terms with a world in which the U.S. government has transitioned from acting as the principal guarantor of an open trading system to operating what is essentially a global protection racket. “This is about coercion and coercive bargaining,” Riekeles said. “The U.S. Administration is pursuing an approach that doesn’t take account of any rules, or prior commitments, but is purely based on might. Might is right. If you can get something by exerting pressure, then do it. If you are not willing to exert counter-pressure, you are going to end up being weak and bullied.” Under a series of executive orders that Trump signed this week, levies ranging from ten per cent to fifty per cent will be imposed on goods from scores of nations, beginning next Thursday. As is only to be expected, most of the coverage of Trump trade policies focussed on major U.S. trading partners, such as Canada, Mexico, Japan, India, and the E.U. But the list of places whose products will be subjected to tariffs include poverty-stricken Chad and Lesotho; Laos and Iraq, two countries that have surely suffered enough in the past from U.S. actions, will face respective tariffs of forty per cent and thirty-five per cent. From an economic and business perspective, the fact that the new tariff regime is so complicated—vastly different rates across countries, with exemptions for certain goods—is an additional burden. But from Trump’s Mafia-boss perspective it is a feature rather than a bug, because it allows him to reward and punish individual nations and industries based on his political whims. Thus, coffee and many other goods from Brazil, which has incurred his wrath by indicting his fellow-strongman Jair Bolsonaro, will be hit with duties of fifty per cent, but Brazilian iron ore, which the politically powerful U.S. steel industry relies on, will be exempted. After Canada announced this week that it supported Palestinian statehood, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them.” Another novel feature of the deals that the Trump Administration has made is that, under duress, Japan and the E.U. pledged to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States. Evidently, Trump is using the same playbook with which he bullied universities and law firms by threatening to withhold federal funding and contracts. There is also a historical analogy. The new Trumpian trade regime, featuring tribute transfers to the hegemon as well as high tariff walls, resembles the extractive economic policies of the Ming dynasty more than the open trade order to which American Presidents from Harry Truman to Barack Obama pledged fealty. “In Europe, we still have the habit of thinking of the U.S. as a friend and ally,” Riekeles quipped. Trump is helping many non-Americans to break this habit. At home, meanwhile, he is resorting to the actions of a petty dictator by attacking the independent central bank and firing an economic scorekeeper. If he persists with this strategy, it will further undermine the credibility and strength of the U.S. economy, but it surely won’t enable him to disguise the consequences of his policies. They are already becoming clearer. ♦

Title: Ethereum Taker Sell Volume Hits $335M In Just 2 Minutes: Panic Or Profit-Taking?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum has faced an 8% correction since Monday, cooling off from its recent rally and slipping below the key $3,850 level. This move suggests that the bullish momentum that carried ETH higher in July is beginning to fade, with price now entering a critical consolidation phase. Bulls are still holding key support levels, but the threat of a deeper correction is growing as selling pressure intensifies. On-chain data shows signs of profit-taking from large investors, adding to short-term volatility and uncertainty. Heavy selling volume over the past two days has sparked speculation across the market, especially as Ethereum remains below recent local highs. Analysts are split in their outlook—some argue that this is a healthy pullback within a broader uptrend, while others warn of a potential slide toward the $3,400–$3,500 range if sentiment worsens. Despite the recent drop, Ethereum’s long-term structure remains intact, with fundamentals like growing DeFi usage and Layer 2 adoption continuing to support the narrative. However, the next few days will be critical. If bulls can defend current levels and regain momentum, ETH could attempt another move toward $4,000. If not, the market may see extended downside pressure before a clearer recovery emerges. According to top analyst Maartunn, Ethereum experienced a dramatic spike in taker sell volume, reaching $335 million in just two minutes. This massive wave of sell orders signals a key moment in the market, one that could mark either the peak of profit-taking or the end of panic-driven capitulation. While some interpret the event as large investors securing gains after the recent rally, others believe this could reflect emotional selling from retail traders spooked by short-term volatility. Despite the heavy selling pressure, Ethereum’s long-term bullish narrative remains intact. Large players continue to accumulate, taking advantage of dips and buying from weaker hands. This activity suggests strategic positioning ahead of expected growth in adoption, especially as Ethereum cements its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. ETH spent months in a downtrend earlier this year, weighed down by macro uncertainty and regulatory fears. Yet, while the broader market showed weakness, sophisticated investors appeared to accumulate. Now, with sentiment shifting and the price structure strengthening, Ethereum seems well-positioned for the months ahead. The $335 million sell-off highlights market vulnerability—but also shows that whales are stepping in. If price holds current levels and sentiment stabilizes, Ethereum could see a renewed push toward the $4,000 mark as confidence returns. Ethereum (ETH) has officially broken below its critical resistance zone near $3,860, signaling increased selling pressure and short-term weakness. After maintaining a steady range for nearly two weeks, the price has dropped to $3,619 on the 4-hour chart, finding temporary support just above the 100-period SMA (green line), currently near $3,670. This breakdown comes amid an uptick in bearish volume, suggesting momentum may favor sellers in the short term. The 50-period SMA (blue line), located around $3,762, has now turned into near-term resistance, capping any immediate recovery attempts. If bulls fail to reclaim the $3,760–$3,800 zone, Ethereum could risk deeper downside toward the next key support around $3,175 (200 SMA, red line) or even $2,852, which served as a base in early July. Despite this weakness, the broader trend remains structurally bullish as long as price stays above the 200 SMA. However, bulls must reclaim the $3,860 level and build momentum above it to regain strength. Until then, volatility is expected, especially as profit-taking and macro uncertainty weigh on sentiment.

Title: Bank of America Reports Growing Interest in Tokenization of Real-World Assets

Bank of America is reportedly seeing growing interest from investors in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).

Δ These RWAs include stocks, bonds, bank deposits and real estate, CoinDesk reported Friday (Aug. 1), citing Bank of America analysts. Investors see opportunities in fractional ownership that broadens access to previously illiquid asset classes, as well as risks of disruption to financial institutions’ transaction services businesses, according to the report. At the same time, there’s a growing belief that financial institutions will adapt to the growing use of blockchain technology, per the report. The tokenization of RWAs is driving an on-chain revolution across capital markets, PYMNTS reported in April. RWAs are tangible or intangible assets that have been tokenized and placed on a blockchain. Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital token that represents ownership or a claim on an underlying asset. Tokenization of these assets enables organizations and enterprises to take advantage of automated processes on various blockchains, and the tokenization of traditionally illiquid assets makes them easier to buy, sell and trade on secondary markets. The President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets’ report “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” which was released Wednesday (July 30) by the White House, sets expectations for digital asset governance while signaling federal alignment on the need to facilitate innovation — particularly in payments infrastructure and tokenized financial instruments. When asset manager BlackRock unveiled its first tokenized fund issued on a public blockchain, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, BlackRock’s Web3 partner in the fund, said: “Tokenization of securities could fundamentally transform capital markets. Today’s news demonstrates that traditional financial products are being made more accessible through digitization.” Reports over the last month or so said that JPMorgan is developing a new service to tokenize carbon credits, Kraken unveiled a platform allowing retail investors to buy tokenized versions of major U.S. equities, and Robinhood announced it was rolling out tokenized stocks to a select cohort of international users. Each of these initiatives moves traditional financial services onto the blockchain, representing a coordinated push by financial giants to tokenize RWAs.

Flip flops are back, according to the fashion world, with the Y2K sandals popping up on runways and red carpets seemingly everywhere. But, according to those of us who don’t attend fashion shows or A-list movie premieres, flip flops never left. The best flip flops are as much a summer essential as they’ve ever been, whether you’re headed to a five-star resort or a public pool. However, not all flip flops are made equal. Some offer extra support, others feature a superior build quality, and a good portion of flip flops are just not the move, stylewise (even with the sandals’ trendiness). Ahead, our style editors have rounded up TK of the best flip flops to wear in 2025, including everything from budget picks to high-end options. $69.99 Rainbow’s flip flops are a best-seller for good reason. They offer great support that only gets better as you wear them in, and feature a classic surfer look. The sandals’ nylon and leather construction is built to last for years of flapping on sand, sidewalks, and rocks, more than justifying their price tag over cheap rubber flip flops. $13.00 $26.00 50% off We love classic Havaianas. Their straightforward rubber construction is ideal for beating up and getting wet, and the iconic logo (especially paired with the Brazil flag) is instantly recognizable. They’re not great for long walks, but I think they look just as cool as the ones designers are putting out right now. The difference? They cost $26 on Amazon (on sale right now for $13). $75 British label Orlebar Brown is best known for its upscale swim trunks, so its no surprise they make a great flip flop too. Playful yet grown-up, these Hastons sandals feature a plush cork footbed, colorful stripes on the sides, and soft rubber thongs. For flip flops from a designer like OB, they’re also very reasonably priced at $75. $80 If you’re looking for something that can handle more steps — maybe down a long beach trail — check out these best-selling Ohana flip flops from OluKai. The cushioned footbed is moulded for maximum support, and the sole features a grippy texture for traction. The thongs are also thick and well-fitted for better mobility. They’re not the most fashionable (in our opinion), but they’re easily the most functional option on this list. $395 Want to see how designers are elevating flip flops? Check out these ​​Grosgrain sandals from Brunello Cucinelli. They’re not the uber-popular thongs from The Row (you can buy those here, if they’re in stock), but they have a similar upscale look and big-name designer tag to boot. They boast namesake grosgrain straps and a premium leather footbed that feels right at home in a fancy beachfront hotel. $65 Reef flip flops are still the go-to flip flops for actual surfers. Our favorite pair is the Fanning, named after the 3X world champion Mick Fanning. The sandals have lots of great features, like a plush, supportive footbed and grippy sole, but they have one amazing feature: a bottle opener on the bottom. Gross? Maybe. Endlessly fun? Absolutely. $139.00 Who says flip-flops can’t be chic? This sleek black pair from best-selling brand Raye begs to differ. Featuring a knotted strap and cushioned insole, they’re as versatile as it gets. Pair them with a breezy maxi dress and your favorite designer bag (maybe leave the Labubu at home this time), or keep it casual with jeans and a vintage band tee. Bonus: Revolve offers two-day shipping, so if you’re in the middle of a flip-flop emergency (yes, that’s a thing), they’ll be at your door in 48 hours or less. $70.00 I’ve long been obsessed with TKEES, and apparently so has J.Lo. Jenny from the Block was recently spotted strolling in a pair of their sandals, and let’s be honest: she wouldn’t settle for just anything. This particular style features a sleek metallic finish (available in silver and gold) and comes in sizes 5 through 11. $80.00 Dolce Vita has been in my rotation since I stumbled upon the brand while working at a boutique in 2017 (they were even my wedding shoes). So it’s no surprise that this elevated flip-flop made the cut. With its platform design and small heel, it easily passes for a dressier shoe at first glance. But don’t be fooled, the single criss-cross strap makes it a bona fide flip-flop, just with a major upgrade. $300.00 Jellies are so back, baby. The early-2000s design has officially returned, and frankly, we’re glad. These squishy, comfy sandals were once seen on every celeb and magazine cover, and now, they’re having a moment in 2025. Christopher Esber’s take on the jelly flip-flop brings that same Y2K vibe but with a slight twist. Try the trend out for yourself by pre-ordering this pair from FWRD. $98.00 A timeless and classic choice, this pair from Kate Spade Outlet is a great option for under $100. Their crisp white design makes them easy to wear, while the subtle floral detailing adds a unique touch that sets them apart from basic white flip-flops — definitely no 2005 Old Navy vibes here. The brand states that they are “crafted from smooth leather,” which will help them last over time. $750.00 These might look like a normal pair of black flip-flops, but don’t be fooled: they’re far from normal. Spotted on celebs like Jennifer Lawrence and Zoë Kravitz, these viral sandals are hardly ever in stock. Snag a pair in your size while you still can — they won’t be around for long. $30.00 Havaianas are arguably the most iconic flip flop company in the world. The Brazilian-born brand is known for its ultra-comfy, no-frills styles, like this classic beige pair. With six other color options to choose from, your flip-flop rotation is officially set. $35.00 At under $40, these jelly flip-flops from Jeffrey Campbell are an absolute steal. They’ve got a fun retro vibe and add a cool pop of color to whatever you pair them with. One Anthropologie reviewer even raved, “Surprisingly comfy for jellies. Obsessed with the green color this season, and they’re perfect. I didn’t think jelly flip-flops could elevate an outfit, but these did!” $12.99 $13.99 7% off And when you just need something easy, these Amazon flip flops get the job done. Great for the beach, quick errands, or letting the dog out, they’re currently on sale for under $13. Plus, with your Prime membership, they can arrive as soon as the next day for that last-minute trip you forgot to pack for. We want to hear it. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

Read By Platformonomics TGIF is a weekly roll-up of links, comments on those links, and perhaps a little too much tugging on my favorite threads. Type your email… Subscribe Quarterly CAPEX week, plus updates from a bunch of our favorite recurring characters! This has to be the high point of your Hot (Mess of an Epstein Coverup) Summer! Buckle up, as we have a lot this week! Coin flip whether I write next week. The four hyperCAPEX companies spent $96.78 billion on CAPEX, up 25% from Q1 and up 65% from a year ago. Nearly 12 digits. In a quarter. The usual caveat: this is overwhelmingly cloud/AI spend except for Amazon which also spends on warehouses, trucks, satellite constellations, etc. AWS was 61% of Amazon’s CAPEX spend in calendar 2024 (they don’t break out quarterly), so the AWS Q2 spend was probably on par with Google and Microsoft ($20B+). UPDATE: Amazon is now breaking out CAPEX by segment on a quarterly basis. AWS spent $16.043B in Q2, so only 52% of company CAPEX spend. That is down 22% from Q1, up 25% from a year ago. 🚨🚨🚨 The companies remain supply-constrained, and are starting to highlight ballooning depreciation costs on the horizon, which will impact earnings. And the useful life of cutting edge GPUs remains unknown. Previous: Big CAPEX Scoreboard – Q1 2025, Big CAPEX Scorecard – Q4 2024, Big CAPEX Scorecard – Q3 2024, Follow the CAPEX: Cloud Table Stakes 2024 Retrospective Related: AI capex may be ~2% of US GDP in 2025, SPV Financing Risks Amazon-wide CAPEX was $33.32 billion, up 32% for the quarter, up 85% for the year. Amazon gave no specific breakdown of their CAPEX other than saying it was “primarily” for AWS, so we’ll assume AWS CAPEX was ~60% of the total. UPDATE: Amazon is now breaking out CAPEX by segment on a quarterly basis. AWS spent $16.043B in Q2, so only 52% of company CAPEX spend. That is down 22% from Q1, up 25% from a year ago. 🚨🚨🚨 Despite beating on both revenue and earnings, the market didn’t like Amazon’s guidance and/or AI positioning. “It is early days…” blah blah blah “…it is early days” didn’t compel. This the first time I can recall that the FinTwit mob going after CEO and AWS AI product manager Andy Jassy. Time for a Polymarket bet on whether Bezos returns as CEO? CAPEX: Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $31,400,000,000 in q two. AWS continues to be the primary driver as we invest to support demand for our AI services and increasingly in custom silicon like Tranium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support growth of the business, improve delivery speeds, and lower our cost to serve by investing in same day delivery facilities as well as robotics and automation. Supply constraints: You know, as I mentioned, well, we have more demand than we have capacity at this point. And I think that and and you see, you know, some of the constraints, and they kind of exist in multiple places. The single biggest constraint is power. But I you know, you also see constraints off and on with chips and then some of the components that, you know, once you have the chips to actually make the servers, you know, you there are you know, sometimes you have new generations of chips that are a little bit later than they’re supposed to be and sometimes you get the chips and, you know, the yield you get in making servers isn’t what you what you expect when you get to ramp. Guidance: We expect Q2 CapEx to be reasonably representative of our quarterly capital investment rate for the back half of this year. Depreciation: AWS margins also saw headwinds from higher depreciation expense as well as unfavorable impacts from year over year fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The depreciation expense is a result of our growing investments in capital expenditures in AWS. As we’ve said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we are making at any point in time. We will continue to invest more capital in chips, data centers, and power to pursue this unusually large opportunity that we have in generative AI. “Early Days”: Question: So there is a Wall Street Finance person narrative right now that AWS is falling behind in GenAI with concerns about share loss to peers, etcetera. Can you just sort of address that? What what is your rebuttal to that? So on on the first one around AI, the first thing I would say is that I think it is so early right now in AI. <six paragraphs of platitudes> I still think it’s very early days in AI and in terms of adoption. Such a missed opportunity to let us know exactly how many steps we now are into the AI race. Previous: Amazon CAPEX – Q4 2024, Amazon CAPEX – Q3 2024, Q2 Amazon CAPEX, Q1 Amazon CAPEX, AWS re:Invent Weirdness, The Arc of the Generative AI Universe Bends Towards Cash: Anthropic Edition, Culture Clash Conjecture: Amazon and Anthropic, Amazon Even More Bullish on Finding a Compression Algorithm for Experience, 326 Features into a 10k Race, Existential Corner: How Many Steps into the 10K are We?, Team Primitives: What Sayest Thou?, Amazon Desperately Seeks Compression Algorithm for Experience, Most Greatest AI Company in Entire Universe Makes Major Strategy Pivot, SEC Embraces Platformonomics ClownWatch™, Warns Amazon and IBM, The AWS Generative AI Soap Opera, The Amazon AI Inferiority Complex $22.45 billion, up 31% from Q1, up 70% from a year ago. Google is ramping CAPEX nicely, but it has taken awhile (and Google had skimped on CAPEX for a few years before the AI boom). Data centers: We operate the leading global network of AI-optimized data centers and cloud regions. CAPEX: With respect to CapEx in the second quarter, our CapEx was $22.4 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure, with approximately two-thirds of investments in servers and one-third in data centers and networking equipment. Supply constraints: While we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployments, we expect to remain in a tight demand-supply environment going into 2026. As Sundar mentioned earlier, this is not the type of investment that’s a light switch. It takes time to make this investment. So what you’re seeing now is investments we made some time ago that’s now translating to additional capacity coming online, but more of that towards the back end of the year. Guidance: Moving to investments, given the strong demand for our Cloud products and services, we now expect to invest approximately $85 billion in CapEx in 2025, up from a previous estimate of $75 billion. Our updated outlook reflects additional investment in servers, the timing of delivery of servers and an acceleration in the pace of data center construction, primarily to meet Cloud customer demand. Looking out to 2026, we expect a further increase in CapEx due to the demand we’re seeing from customers as well as growth opportunities across the company. Depreciation: In terms of expenses. First, as I mentioned on our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In the second quarter, depreciation increased $1.3 billion year-over-year to $5 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 35%. Given the recent increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate further in Q3. Previous: Google CAPEX – Q4 2024, Google CAPEX – Q3 2024, Q2 Google CAPEX, Q1 Google CAPEX $17.01 billion, up 25% from Q1, up 100% from a year ago. Despite being the runt of the hyperCAPEX litter, Meta is currently by far the most entertaining of the bunch to watch, as we try to match their ambitions to their capabilities. No Big Tech company oscillates more in perception between future dominance and doomed roadkill than Meta. They’re already into their second AI cycle, as they take a mulligan and do a complete restart. So many interesting paradoxes. If you throw enough money around on a restart, maybe no one will ask why the last effort went awry? Why does the company need to create a new organization “unencumbered by the bureaucracy of the $1.8tn company“? Personal superintelligence sounds great, but why would anyone trust them to run it? (Apple so much better positioned, but, alas, execution issues). Putting datacenters in tents? In hurricane country? As the hyperCAPEX runt, how exactly does Meta plan to “have the largest compute fleet of any company“? (don’t make me publish the cumulative CAPEX chart yet again). And where will they get the power? CAPEX: Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $17.0 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Guidance: Turning now to the capex outlook. We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $66-72 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $64-72 billion and up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at the mid-point. While the infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant capex dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our AI efforts and business operations. On the CapEx side, the big driver of our increased CapEx in ‘26 will be scaling GenAI capacity as we build out training capacity that’s going to drive higher spend across servers, networking, data centers next year. So at present, we’re not really thinking about external use cases on the infrastructure, but I’d say it’s a good question. Depreciation (may be optimistic on deprec schedules – CHAOS) That’s driven primarily by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth in 2026, largely driven by recognizing incremental depreciation from assets that we purchased and placed in service in ‘26 as well as from infrastructure deployed through 2025 that we’ll recognize a full year of depreciation next year. While we’re still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate. The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet We also expect a greater mix of our CapEx to be in shorter-lived assets in 2025 and ‘26 than it has been in prior years. Financing CAPEX: …on your second question about how we expect to finance the growing CapEx next year. We certainly expect that we will finance some large share of that ourselves, but we’re also exploring ways to work with financial partners to codevelop data centers. We don’t have any finalized transactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be models here that will attract significant external financing to support large-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to build world-class infrastructure while providing us with flexibility should our infrastructure requirements change over time. So we are exploring many different paths Previous: Meta CAPEX – Q1 2025, Meta CAPEX – Q4 2024, Meta CAPEX – Q3 2024, Q2 Meta CAPEX, Q1 Meta CAPEX, CAPEX Clues: Enter LlamaGate, Meta AI: Founder Mode or “Win Now” Mode?, Is This Founder Mode?

It’s the Copy Button., Remember the Metaverse? $24.2 billion for the quarter, up 13% from Q1, up 27% from a year ago. Satya “I’m good for my $80 billion” Nadella in fact spent $88.2 billion in the promised fiscal year. Data centers: We opened new DCs across six continents, and now have over 400 datacenters across 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. We stood up more than two gigawatts of new capacity over the past 12 months alone. And we continue to scale our owned datacenter capacity faster than any other competitor. Demand: And, while we brought additional datacenter capacity online this quarter, demand remains higher than supply. CAPEX: Capital expenditures were $24.2 billion, including $6.5 billion of finance leases where we recognize the full value at the time of lease commencement. Cash paid for P, P, and E, was $17.1 billion. The difference is primarily due to finance leases. More than half of our spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, and driven by strong demand signals. Guidance: Capital expenditure growth, as we shared last quarter, will moderate compared to FY25 with a greater mix of short-lived assets. Due to the timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1, including large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2. We expect Q1 capital expenditures to be over $30 billion driven by the continued strong demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services on a significant base. Even as we continue bringing more datacenter capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity constrained through the first half of our fiscal year.

The “hipster antitrust” movement has been hugely influential in recent years, despite lacking any kind of an intellectual model for antitrust beyond shouting “break them up”. You can argue these hipsters helped drive Silicon Valley into Trump’s arms, amongst other consequences. Lately the hipsters have been vociferous in their opposition to the Abundance book and movement, which takes the radical position that governments should try to make their policies actually work. Abundance author Derek Thompson decided to dig into the hipsters’ criticisms: The sharpest criticisms of the book Abundance have sometimes come from the antitrust movement. This group, mostly on the left, insists that the biggest problems in America typically come from monopolies and the corruption of big business. I’m not an economist or a lawyer. I’m just a journalist. To the extent that I’m good at anything, it’s calling people on the phone and writing down what they say. So I reached out to the primary sources that Musharbash quotes throughout the piece. What I found was astonishing. The economist Musharbash cites told me that his theories had been misapplied. The housing analysts quoted in the piece told me Musharbash distorted their points and reached dubious, or even flatly wrong, conclusions. The leading monopoly researcher I spoke to, whose work has been celebrated by the antitrust left, told me that the entire thrust of the article—and, by extension, much of the antitrust-housing philosophy—defied sophisticated antitrust analysis. The essay you’re reading is very long. But I can sum it up in one sentence: The Musharbash essay on Dallas—like too much of the antitrust left’s work on housing—is filled with out-of-context quotes, overconfident assertions lacking evidence, and generally misguided claims. The subsequent online discourse has been hilarious. And the hipsters have responded with insults and unsubstantiated claims, but no effort to refute the specifics.

Title: Ripple CTO Answers 6 Pertinent Questions About XRP In Quest To Take Over SWIFT
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-answers-to-xrp-questions/
Time Published: 2025-08-01T20:00:19Z
Full Content:
Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has addressed critical questions regarding XRP’s role as the crypto firm looks to replace SWIFT. Schwartz indicated that the altcoin was irreplaceable in the firm’s operations despite the issuance of the RLUSD stablecoin. In an X post, Ripple CTO first touched on the question of how the crypto firm has over 300 bank partnerships, but XRP on-chain volume remains low. Schwartz opined that there are several reasons why their clients have preferred to use the altcoin off-chain rather than on-chain. However, he believes that they are close to changing that because institutions are now seeing the benefits of moving on-chain. The Ripple CTO admitted that XRP’s on-chain volume has been very slow. He noted that even the crypto firm can’t use the XRPL DEX for payments yet because they can’t be sure a terrorist won’t provide the liquidity for payment. Schwartz added that features like permissioned domains will address this issue. Secondly, the Ripple CTO addressed why XRP is still being used over stablecoins for transfers despite its volatility. He explained that there are use cases where volatility isn’t a minus and is instead a plus. He remarked that generally, the view for most digital assets is that the upside outweighs the downside. As such, as long as one isn’t very risk-averse, Schwartz believes that holding the altcoin is not a disadvantage. The next question was about the incentive to hold XRP if volatility isn’t an issue, because it is a bridge currency. The Ripple CTO said that a bridge currency only works if someone is holding it, so they can get it precisely when they need it. He suggested that it may be best to hold XRP, which is the current dominant bridge currency, because it should be cheaper to exchange it into whatever they happen to next. Furthermore, David Schwartz answered whether XRP as a bridge currency will still be necessary when stablecoins cover most pairs in the future. The Ripple CTO answered that if one stablecoin wins, then the altcoin won’t be necessary, as that stablecoin will just serve as the bridge currency. However, the Ripple CTO opined that one stablecoin can’t win for several reasons. This includes the fact that a stablecoin can only be stable relative to one particular fiat currency and will always have jurisdictional ties. As such, Schwartz believes that it still makes sense to have a bridge asset like XRP in this multi-stablecoin world. As to why giants like BlackRock would want to use XRP Ledger for tokenization instead of building their own blockchain, the Ripple CTO doesn’t think that will matter as long as there is interoperability and asset portability. He added that multi-chains are a good form of scalability as well. Meanwhile, on geopolitical risk and why foreign countries would trust a U.S.-based private company payment network, the Ripple CTO clarified that the XRPL is not really U.S.-based. Schwartz further remarked that the network has never discriminated against any particular participant. He also noted that Ripple has separately licensed entities in many jurisdictions for its enterprise payment products, which makes it not restricted to just the U.S. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Aug. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Larry Fink’s BlackRock loses bid to dismiss Texas climate collusion claims
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/08/01/business/larry-finks-blackrock-loses-bid-to-dismiss-texas-climate-collusion-claims/
Time Published: 2025-08-01T18:04:34Z
Full Content:
A US judge on Friday largely rejected a request by top asset managers including BlackRock to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Texas and 12 other Republican-led states that said the companies violated antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Tyler, Texas, agreed to dismiss just three of the 21 counts in the states’ lawsuit, that also names institutional investors State Street and Vanguard. The lawsuit is among the highest-profile cases targeting efforts to promote environmental, social and governance goals. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the three companies “created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets and squeeze more money out of hardworking Americans,” and that “today’s victory represents a major step in holding them accountable.” The three asset managers said they would continue to defend against the claims, with Vanguard calling the ruling disappointing, and State Street calling the case a risk to investors and energy markets. “By pursuing forced divestment, the Attorneys General are undermining the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” BlackRock said. The ruling by Kernodle, who was appointed by President Trump, means the states can move forward with their claims that the asset managers violated US antitrust law by joining Climate Action 100+, an investor initiative to take action to combat climate change, and used their shareholder advocacy in furtherance of its goals. Kernodle, however, dismissed claims that the asset managers violated Louisiana and Nebraska consumer protection laws. The companies have denied wrongdoing and called the case “half-baked.” But the states’ theories garnered support from Trump-appointed antitrust enforcers at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. The outcome of the lawsuit could have major implications for how the companies, which together manage some $27 trillion, approach their holdings and passive funds. One possible remedy sought by the plaintiffs would be for the fund firms to divest holdings in coal companies, which BlackRock has said would harm the companies’ access to capital and likely raise energy prices.

A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate entangled in U.S.-China tensions has appealed for legal protection for businesses in Panama after the company’s contract over its Panama Canal port assets has been faced with lawsuits HONG KONG -- A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate entangled in U.S.-China tensions appealed on Friday for legal protection for businesses in Panama after the company's contract over its Panama Canal port assets has been faced with lawsuits in the Central American country. Respect for the rule of law is essential to assure businesses that Panama is a safe place to invest in, Panama Ports Company, under Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings, said in a statement. Panama’s Comptroller General filed two lawsuits on Wednesday, seeking to declare unconstitutional a contract that granted the operation of ports at both ends of the canal to the Hong Kong subsidiary, and to nullify its renewal four years ago, saying it was “abusive” of Panama's interests. In turn, Panama Ports Company said its operations have had a positive impact, from building world-class ports to creating more than 25,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributing billions of balboas — Panama's currency — to the country's economy. It said it wants to work with the government in Panama for a better future. “Regarding the ongoing legal actions, we firmly believe that respect for legal protection and the rule of law are essential in order to provide businesses and investors with the certainty that Panama is a safe country to invest in,” it said. The company operates the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, under a concession contract approved in 1997 and renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. CK Hutchison is controlled by the family of Li Ka-shing, the southern Chinese city’s richest man. Panama’s comptroller authority in April said that an audit of Panama Ports Company found irregularities in the renewal of the concession. But the company denied allegations that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country. Panama President José Raúl Mulino said during his weekly news conference on Thursday that he fully supported the comptroller’s case and would await the court’s verdict. “We have all seen what that contract has costed the Panamanian nation over time,” Mulino said without elaborating. He alluded to some sort of public-private partnership for the ports, saying there was a lot of interest from private companies, but that it was in the early stages and provided no details. CK Hutchison Holdings’ initial plan, announced in March, to sell its port assets in dozens of countries to a group that includes the U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., also got caught up in tensions between Beijing and Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has alleged that China interferes with the canal, initially welcomed that plan. However, it apparently angered Beijing and drew a review by Chinese anti-monopoly authorities. After months of uncertainty, Hutchison said on Monday that it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers, which also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. The initial deal, valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the two at the Panama Canal. Panama Ports Company said Friday it would communicate with the Panamanian government “at the appropriate time,” affirming that it believes engaging with the government “is vital to discuss the way forward for” the company. Panama's government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the operation of the ports by Hutchison does not mean Chinese control of it. ___ Associated Press journalist Alma Solís in Panama City contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Microsoft tops $4T in valuation — great news for the company, not so great for its workers
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/4032921/microsoft-tops-4t-in-valuation-great-news-for-the-company-not-so-great-for-its-workers.html
Time Published: 2025-08-01T16:09:17Z
Full Content:
If you own Microsoft stock, you’ve got to be happy. Microsoft’s latest financial results for the quarter ending June 30, 2025 were robust: Revenue reached $76.4 billion (up 18% year-over-year), with net income at $27.2 billion (up 24%). The primary driver was robust growth in Microsoft’s cloud and AI businesses. Azure’s revenue, which has finally been separated out in the financial reporting, now stands at $75 billion in annual revenue, representing a 34% surge for the year. Put it all together, and you can see why Microsoft has joined Nvidia in the $4-trillion valuation club. So much for the good news. Despite those impressive financials, Microsoft has laid off a substantial number of employees this year — about 25,000, to be exact, including roughly 9,100 in July alone (approximately 4% of its workforce). The layoffs have affected a broad range of divisions, including Xbox, engineering, and management layers. What’s driving these cuts is clearly not poor performance. Instead, Microsoft is betting that its aggressive $80 billion AI investments will pay off. Don’t take my word for it: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently noted the “incongruence” of laying off employees even as Microsoft is “thriving.” He called this dynamic “the enigma of success” in a tech industry where progress demands constant change, even when things are going well. “I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left,” he added. “Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful.” I’m sure deep gratitude will help keep a roof over their heads. Microsoft is far from alone in dumping once-valued employees for cheaper AI alternatives. IBM has cut 8,000 jobs so far this year. In particular, IBM is gradually replacing clerical jobs with AI, while its AskHR bot has taken over much of HR’s old workloads. At the same time, Meta is reducing its staff by 5% in 2025 as it switches gears from its metaverse dud to AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy put an even finer point on where things are headed. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done.” That means, he said, “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” This isn’t just happening in the US. In India, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has cut 12,000 jobs this year. Why? Because its customers are moving to AI, which has sharply cut the outsourcing work the company has historically profited from. Meanwhile, in Japan, Indeed and Glassdoor’s parent company has laid off 1,300 workers, approximately 6% of its workforce, according to CEO Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba. “AI is changing the world,” he said. It certainly changed the world of the 130,000 or so tech jobs that have been lost this year, according to estimates by The Bridge Chronicle. Oh, and by the way, Indeed reports that tech job postings in July were down 36% from their early 2020 levels. Is this a great time to be looking for a tech job or what!? But for every fantasy job, like the $100-million AI jobs Meta is supposedly offering, there are hundreds of tech workers who have kissed their six-figure positions goodbye and thousands of clerical staffers who will no longer be making five-figure annual incomes. There’s one little problem with all these job cuts. We still don’t know whether AI can deliver the work goods. Sure, some jobs, such as repetitive HR or call-center work, can be largely replaced. Heck, we’ve seen that happen before. I remember when many call-center jobs were located in the US — before companies figured out that outsourcing such jobs to low-cost countries was cheaper. For jobs like these, AI is just the next step in cost-cutting. Companies often use AI like that — to cut costs. Not many are using it to help good workers become great workers. Instead, CEOs are buying the illusion that AI can magically replace highly skilled workers. I hate to break it to you: It can’t. Take programming. According to the 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 84% of programmers now use or plan to use AI tools in their workflow. However — and this is a crucial point — 46% of AI-using developers don’t trust AI results. In fact, even as AI developer tools have supposedly improved, programmers are trusting them even less. Why? Because they’re spending a lot of their time fixing AI mistakes. AI programming tools make fine interns, but they’re not senior or even mid-level developers. Let’s also remember that in the last few weeks, Replit, the leading vibe-coding company, which promises to make “software creation accessible to everyone, entirely through natural language,” wrecked a production database for a senior tech executive who was trying, and spectacularly failing, to build a new application. The bottom line is that AI is not good enough, not yet anyway, to replace engineers and developers. This will come back and bite companies like Microsoft in the rump. Sure, the market loves companies that cut costs. But if AI doesn’t deliver on its promises, getting all those experienced ex-workers back in the foldwon’t be easy. Today, AI is great for getting people to believe that groups of bunnies love hopping on trampolines; but doing hard technical work? That’s another question entirely. Steven J.

U.S. stock market tumbled hard after a weak July jobs report and President Trump’s new tariffs on 66 countries reignited fears of a global trade war. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq plunged as job growth slowed to just 73,000, and unemployment rose to 4.2%. With sharp revisions in previous job data and fresh tariff shocks, investor confidence took a hit. Bond yields dropped, and recession fears are growing louder. Major stocks like Amazon and Apple slipped, while Wall Street now bets the Federal Reserve could cut rates in September to stabilize the slowing economy.

Title: IPO pops are back, AI starts to pay off for Big Tech, and Palo Alto Networks spends big

UPDATED 11:37 EDT / AUGUST 01 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Palo Alto Networks is charging full speed ahead on attempting to be as much of a one-stop cyber shop as is possible in the fast-changing field, buying CyberArk for a stunning $25 billion. Investors weren’t especially happy, but properly integrated, it’s probably worthwhile long-term. And as Zeus Kerravala notes, it’s a good addition for its artificial intelligence play. IPOs keep on coming, just this week from Ambiq and Figma — the latter up more than threefold so fast trading had to be halted, and then topped $140 in after-hours trading. Pops are back, baby. Of course, those represent money left on the table, but they could spur more of the tech industry’s prime wealth-building mechanisms that have been in short supply for years now. As for Figma’s success, you can thank former Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Kahn, of all people, Alex Wilhelm notes, since she resisted a deal with Adobe three years ago. Just when you thought AI funding couldn’t get any crazier… it does. OpenAI reportedly is in talks to raise $8.3 billion at a stunning $300 billion valuation, while Anthropic apparently is in talks to raise $5 billion at a $170 billion valuation and Mistral is looking for $1 billion at a $10 billion valuation. Vast Data also is reported to be looking at a multibillion-dollar funding at a $30 billion valuation. And get a load of all those $100 million-plus fundings of other AI or adjacent companies below. The dot-com boom had nothing on this…. Uh-oh. Some big tech companies are making a lot of money thanks in part to the AI boom — not just from selling it but from using its efficiencies internally, as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out. But they’re also spending a lot to meet that demand, as Microsoft, Meta and Amazon showed this week. In fact, that’s what tripped up Amazon a day later, as its guidance came in light, suggesting its AI investments may take longer to pay off. For now, at least, their core businesses are doing well enough to support that spending. Next week there’s still a lot of earnings reports coming from Advanced Micro Devices, Supermicro, Uber, Lyft, Palantir and many more. Speaking of Zuckerberg, he thinks “superintelligence,” whatever that is, is almost here. Conveniently, he said it’s likely to be delivered via augmented reality glasses like the kind it makes, currently at a multibillion-dollar quarterly loss. I think some of us can be excused for worrying about tech titans deciding how this superintelligence will be used. Dave Vellante dove into stablecoins, finding they’re achieving… stability! Crypto can use some solidity to counter the continuing drumbeat of fraud and other nefarious uses of crypto. Vellante and John Furrier discuss this and other news, in particular digging into what’s really behind Amazon’s latest earnings, on this week’s podcast theCUBE Pod, out now on YouTube.

Of course, those represent money left on the table, but they could spur more of the tech industry’s prime wealth-building mechanisms that have been in short supply for years now. As for Figma’s success, you can thank former Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Kahn, of all people, Alex Wilhelm notes, since she resisted a deal with Adobe three years ago. Just when you thought AI funding couldn’t get any crazier… it does. OpenAI reportedly is in talks to raise $8.3 billion at a stunning $300 billion valuation, while Anthropic apparently is in talks to raise $5 billion at a $170 billion valuation and Mistral is looking for $1 billion at a $10 billion valuation. Vast Data also is reported to be looking at a multibillion-dollar funding at a $30 billion valuation. And get a load of all those $100 million-plus fundings of other AI or adjacent companies below. The dot-com boom had nothing on this…. Uh-oh. Some big tech companies are making a lot of money thanks in part to the AI boom — not just from selling it but from using its efficiencies internally, as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out. But they’re also spending a lot to meet that demand, as Microsoft, Meta and Amazon showed this week. In fact, that’s what tripped up Amazon a day later, as its guidance came in light, suggesting its AI investments may take longer to pay off. For now, at least, their core businesses are doing well enough to support that spending. Next week there’s still a lot of earnings reports coming from Advanced Micro Devices, Supermicro, Uber, Lyft, Palantir and many more. Speaking of Zuckerberg, he thinks “superintelligence,” whatever that is, is almost here. Conveniently, he said it’s likely to be delivered via augmented reality glasses like the kind it makes, currently at a multibillion-dollar quarterly loss. I think some of us can be excused for worrying about tech titans deciding how this superintelligence will be used. Dave Vellante dove into stablecoins, finding they’re achieving… stability! Crypto can use some solidity to counter the continuing drumbeat of fraud and other nefarious uses of crypto. Vellante and John Furrier discuss this and other news, in particular digging into what’s really behind Amazon’s latest earnings, on this week’s podcast theCUBE Pod, out now on YouTube.

UPDATED 11:37 EDT / AUGUST 01 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Palo Alto Networks is charging full speed ahead on attempting to be as much of a one-stop cyber shop as is possible in the fast-changing field, buying CyberArk for a stunning $25 billion. Investors weren’t especially happy, but properly integrated, it’s probably worthwhile long-term. And as Zeus Kerravala notes, it’s a good addition for its artificial intelligence play. IPOs keep on coming, just this week from Ambiq and Figma — the latter up more than threefold so fast trading had to be halted, and then topped $140 in after-hours trading. Pops are back, baby.

Title: US Treasuries Soar As Slower Job Growth Boosts Fed Rate-Cut Bets
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/us-treasuries-soar-as-slower-job-growth-boosts-fed-rate-cut-bets
Time Published: 2025-08-01T15:13:36Z

Treasuries rallied, with short-term yields posting their biggest drop in a year, after softer US jobs data prompted traders to boost bets that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates as soon as next month. Yields on two-year notes tumbled 21 basis points to 3.74%, setting up the biggest drop since last August. Traders fully priced in two rate cuts this year, with an 80% chance of a reduction in September. The move weighed on the dollar and stocks, sending an index of the greenback’s strength down as much as 1% and the S&P 500 nearly 2% lower. The yield moves reflected a dramatic shift in sentiment around the monetary policy outlook, shaped in part by President Donald Trump’s relentless pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates despite elevated inflation expectations. “We would look for the Fed to begin lowering rates in September,” said Gregory Faranello, head of US rates trading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities. “It’s somewhat amazing how you can have a sitting Fed Chair intimate the strength in labor one day and receive these numbers a few days later.” Expectations for rate cuts collapsed on Wednesday after Powell’s latest comments on the outlook, less than an hour after Trump said it was his understanding the Fed would cut in September. Friday’s rebound — a seeming validation of Trump’s view and those of two Fed governors he appointed, who dissented from the July 30 decision not to cut rates — may prove historic. The moves were sparked by a report on US labor that showed payrolls increased 73,000 in July. Figures for the prior two months were revised down by nearly 260,000. The jobless rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%. While the pace of hiring has been slowing since April, Powell said low unemployment indicated the jobs market was “in balance” when explaining why policymakers remain on the sidelines. On Friday, Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman expressed concerns that policymakers’ hesitance to lower rates could risk damaging the labor market. The two policymakers voted against the Fed’s decision this week, opting for a quarter-point reduction. The jobs report suggests Waller’s camp “may hold sway or convince more people to come on his side of the argument. And maybe they missed the opportunity in July but it raises the odds you get it in September,” said Jeffrey Rosenberg, portfolio manager at BlackRock Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. “That is why you are seeing the big move on the front end of the curve.” Friday’s rally reversed Treasuries’ 0.4% loss last month, only the second monthly decline this year. The market is still up 3.4% for the year. “It’s a big beautiful bond market,” said Michael Collins, portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income, said on Bloomberg Television. He prefers the two- to 10-year part of the curve where “you don’t have to take a lot of interest-rate risk to get a lot of benefit.” The magnitude of the shift Friday was reflected in high trading volumes in Treasury futures. Some of that activity involved scrapping wagers on shrinking gaps between short- and long-term Treasury yields, which became losers in the rally unleashed by the jobs data, in which those gaps widened as two- to five-year yields saw the biggest declines.

Title: Amazon Cloud Revenue Fails To Impress; Weak Jobs Number May Make Case For Rate Cut

ByJJ Kinahan ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Key Takeaways After a strong opening on the back of solid earnings from Meta Platforms and Microsoft, markets gave up gains to close flat to down on the day. The S&P 500 lost 0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite closed flat. The Russell 2000 fell 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7%. But that only tells a small part of the story as to what took place during the day. Thursday marked the return of the IPO market in a big way. Figma, a company that makes collaborative tools for building apps and websites went public. The IPO market has been in a lull with several companies, such as Klarna, Chime and StubHub pulling back from plans to go public for various reasons. That placed a lot of attention on the Figma deal. After pricing the deal at $33 per share, the stock initially opened for trading at $85 and was quickly halted because of order imbalances. If you were watching the stock trade, it was a wild ride, but when it was all said and done, shares closed 250% above their IPO price at $115.50. There are a couple things to take away from this IPO. One, I think the fact the stock closed significantly higher than where it was priced speaks to why some companies do not like going the traditional IPO route. There is potential to leave a lot of money on the table. Second, the success of the IPO shows there may be demand from the market for new issues. That would be a potentially healthy sign. After the close Thursday, we had two big earnings releases. Both Amazon and Apple reported second quarter numbers. Both companies reported figures that beat estimates. In the case of Amazon, the company beat on both sales and profits. Amazon Web Services sales were up 17.5%. Cloud computing has been a dominant theme this quarter and the problem for Amazon was, 17.5% didn't cut it. By comparison, Alphabet reported growth of 32% and Microsoft grew 39% in their cloud businesses, respectively. Overnight, Amazon shares were down 7%. By contrast, shares of Apple traded higher after hours on Thursday after beating estimates. iPhones sales came in surprisingly strong. One item though that I think is worth mentioning is the impact of tariffs. Apple reported paying $800M in tariffs for the quarter and the company anticipates they will pay $1.1B in the next quarter. Therefore, we're beginning to see actual dollar figures being incorporated into sales earnings figures and estimates moving forward. Speaking of tariffs. Thursday night, President Trump issued an Executive Order enacting tariffs as his August 1st deadline was reached. The three countries I'll call out here are Mexico, Canada and China. In the cases of Mexico and China, negotiations are continuing, and extensions have been granted temporarily. While that is good, investors should also remain aware that it means there is potential for a market event if an agreement isn't reached. With respect to Canada, tariffs were originally set at 25%, but were increased to 35%, causing markets to pull back in overnight trading. This morning, there is yet more news. On the earnings front, Coinbase missed estimates and that stock is indicated lower by 11%. It's worth noting, however, Coinbase stock is up 135% since its April lows. Shares of Reddit are up 15% after they beat on earnings. The premarket move is pushing the stock through its 21-day moving average. On the economic front, we received the latest jobs report. According to Bloomberg, economists were expecting 106 thousand new jobs and an unemployment rate of 4.2%. The actual number of new jobs created was weaker than expected at 73 thousand, while unemployment held steady at 4.2%. A couple under-the-hood items worth mentioning here are the revisions and where jobs are being created. May and June jobs were revised down by 258 thousand. That is a fairly significant number. Also, the areas in which jobs were created continued to be sectors like home healthcare, which, as I've mentioned before, are not necessarily economic growth sectors. Heading into this morning's report, there was approximately a 40% chance of a rate cut at the Fed meeting in September. Following the report, according to the CME Fed Watch Tool, that probability jumped to 67%. I think markets have a bit of a tug of war scenario unfolding. The earnings data has been strong. Inflation has not shown up in the way many feared. At the same time, the jobs' number was weaker than expected and the downward revisions were large. However, that may give the Fed the ammunition it needs to cut interest rates. Tariffs are now in place, for the most part, and that should allow companies to make more concrete plans and forecasts moving forward. In other words, they have some stability, and markets are big fans of stability. I have mixed emotions about the Figma IPO. On the one hand, a strong IPO market is a good thing. On the other hand, when you take it in the context of the meme mania we've seen recently, it can be another FOMO-type froth indicator. We also have the VIX pushing up near 19 after having been below 16 just a couple days ago, and there are some other measures of volatility that are also creeping higher. For today, I am mainly watching VIX and 6301 in SPX, which is the 21-day moving average. A break below that level could signal some short-term weakness and while next week is lighter on economic data, it's still a big week for warnings. I think the rally we're seeing in bonds and optimism of a Fed rate cut could help give stocks some comfort, but with no meeting until September, there is still a lot of economic data between now and then. I suspect Fed Chair Powell would like to see how the newly signed tariffs show up in the economy, if he can, but I also think the political pressure to cut rates is going to ramp up even more. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives.

U.S. stock market today slumped sharply as President Trump's sweeping global tariffs and a weak July jobs report rattled Wall Street. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all opened in the red, with tech giants like Amazon and Nvidia dragging indexes lower. Job growth slowed significantly to just 73,000, while unemployment rose to 4.2%, raising fresh recession fears. Investors reacted by shifting to safer assets, pushing bond yields down.

Title: Figma Stock Soars 255% Post IPO. Despite Bitcoin, Why To Avoid $FIG Now

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Figma's IPO exploded with a 255% surge, but was massively underpriced, primarily benefiting institutional investors and venture capitalists (post-lockup).Despite strong financials and high demand, the stock faces significant risks: intense competition, an extremely high valuation (P/S 69), and potential share dilution from early investors in January.Figma, a design collaboration platform, is expanding its user base beyond designers and integrating AI to drive future growth. Figma stock exploded out of the IPO block Thursday – and trades about 255% above its offering price of $33, according to Yahoo! Finance. Figma – founded in 2012 – makes software that helps designers to work together. The company is using artificial intelligence and extending its platform to other customer groups – notably software developers with “more than two-thirds of its users now nondesigners,” according to the New York Times. Should you buy Figma stock? Despite many positives about the company – including 46% revenue growth in the first quarter and a 20% net margin, according to the IPO prospectus, here are four reasons to avoid the stock: Figma sees a bright future. “We have so much room to explore how we can make great AI products and experiences,” Figma cofounder and CEO Dylan Field told Bloomberg. “This is a time where we can create tremendous value for our community, our customers, and I think the public market is the right place to do it,” he added. Figma’s IPO produced an attention getting pop – with shares up 255% in the day since the company went public. The massive underpricing of this IPO leaves a whopping $48.7 billion on the table. By selling roughly 7% of its shares at $33, noted the Wall Street Journal, Figma raised a mere $1.2 billion – only a third of which went to Figma – with investors getting the balance, noted CNBC. Had Figma set its offering price higher, it could have raised $3 billion more, the Journal reported. The biggest winners from the deal in the short term are the large institutional clients of the underwriters of the IPO – Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Allen & Company and JPMorgan Chase. “Who benefits?” Benchmark general partner Bill Gurley wrote on X, shortly after the stock began trading. “The large clients of the investment banks (who return the favor paying for other services). They bought it at $33 last night and can sell it today for over $90.” The other beneficiaries will be the venture capitalists who funded the company – which include Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia. However, these investors are bound by 180 day lockup agreements which prevent them from selling the stock until next January, CNBC reported. Other winners from this boffo Figma IPO are privately held tech companies which have been waiting to go public for years since the IPO market suffered a near collapse in November 2021 after word of Jerome Powell’s reappointment as Fed Chair -- to raise interest rates to cut pandemic era inflation. In September 2022, during the IPO market freeze, Figma had agreed to be acquired by Adobe for $20 billion, as I wrote in Forbes. That deal – which would have enabled Adobe to provide its customers with Figma’s very popular design collaboration service – fell apart in 2023 “after U.K. regulators said the tie-up would harm competition,” noted CNBC. Figma’s recovery from that deal’s collapse was indeed impressive – giving the company a valuation well above its $19.3 billion worth at the IPO – which is more than three times the value of the 2022 Adobe deal. While there are many reasons to own Figma stock, the case for avoiding the shares strike me as more compelling. In addition to the risks of the company suffering a stock market decline unless Figma beats and raises in the next several quarters and the possibility venture investors will dump their shares in January, here are two other reasons to avoid the stock: I would not be surprised to see the stock drop in the wake of the company’s next quarterly earnings report. However, if Figma can boost its per customer revenue by adding new services, such a decline could mark a better entry point for investors.

Title: 5 Top Dividend Stocks To Buy For August 2025

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Higher tariffs are coming, and they may bring big changes to the financial markets and economy. In turbulent times, proven dividend stocks can be a stabilizing force for your portfolio. They’re often less volatile than growth stocks, and they pay regular income—a welcome source of return when stock prices are struggling. If you're ready to shore up your income portfolio, take a look at these six dividend payers. One or two may offer the protection you need from tariffs, inflation and stock-price volatility in 2025. The screening criteria for these dividend stocks were designed to return dividend payers with low tariff exposure, the potential for rising cash income for inflation protection and a good balance between upside potential and downside risk: Five stocks met these parameters. They are presented below from largest to smallest market capitalization. The table below highlights five dividend stocks with a regular practice of increasing shareholder payouts. A review of each stock follows. Metrics are sourced from company reports and stockanalysis.com. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025. The PNC Financial Services Group by the numbers: PNC is a regional bank with branches in 28 states. The bank is organized into three reporting segments: retail banking, corporate and institutional banking and asset management group. The asset management group provides investing and wealth management services for individuals and institutions. PNC pays a quarterly dividend of $1.70, for a yield of 3.5%. The bank has raised its dividend annually for 14 years. The most recent increase was a $0.10 raise for the dividend to be paid on August 4, 2025. PNC is investing heavily in growing and improving its branch footprint. The expansion focuses on increasing the bank’s concentration and brand presence in existing markets. The bank has sufficient concentration in six markets, but the goal is 19. In PNC's last earnings report, Chairman and CEO Bill Demchak said the strategy was helping the bank acquire new customers faster and deepen relationships with existing customers. Financial highlights for the quarter included revenue growth of 4%, a 2-basis-point rise in net interest margin (NIM) and diluted EPS growth of 11.9%. NIM is the difference between interest earned on loans and interest paid on deposits, a critical profitability measure for banks. Elevance Health by the numbers: Elevance Health, formerly known as Anthem, operates health plans and provides pharmacy services in the U.S. Brand names in Elevance's portfolio include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Wellpoint and Carelon. Elevance Health pays a quarterly dividend of $1.71, for a yield of 2.4%. The health care company has raised its dividend for 14 consecutive years. Recent increases have been generous, from $1.63 to $1.71 in 2025 and from $1.48 to $1.63 in 2024. Elevance Health is working through a two-part optimization that involves simplifying the health care experience and reducing costs. Progress on costs will be critical as 2025 unfolds. The company recently reversed slowing revenue growth with acquisitions, higher enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans and commercial plan premium increases—but margins have suffered. Despite the margin pressure, Elevance still expects to deliver 12% average annual growth in adjusted diluted EPS over the long term. In the second quarter, Elevance increased operating revenue 14.3% while diluted EPS declined 21.6%. The company had $8.5 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet at June 30, after generating $3 billion in operating cash flow in the first six months of 2025. VICI Properties by the numbers: VICI Properties is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns gaming, hospitality and entertainment properties in the U.S. and Canada. The portfolio includes Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand and the Venetian Resort Las Vegas. In total VICI owns at least 60,000 hotel rooms, 500 restaurants and four championship golf courses. VICI pays a quarterly dividend of $0.4325, for a yield of 5.2%. The REIT has raised its dividend annually for seven years, moving the annual payout from $0.985 in 2018 to $1.69 in 2024. Advantages for VICI include strong balance sheet discipline and solid relationships with premier, deep-pocketed hospitality tenants. The company’s emphasis on unique and high-value properties has delivered annual revenue growth since 2020—notable given that resorts and entertainment destinations were largely shut down for part of 2020. VICI grows its business by acquiring or developing new properties. The company recently announced new partnerships with asset managers Eldridge Industries and Cain International and casino operator Red Rock Resorts. These relationships will support development projects in Beverly Hills and central California. In the first quarter, VICI increased revenue by 3.4%. Funds from operations (FFO), a REIT-specific operating cash flow metric, declined 7.9%. The decline related to a change in the company's credit loss allowance. Despite the FFO decline, VICI raised its full-year adjusted FFO guidance to a range of $2.47 billion to $2.5 billion. The prior FFO guidance range was $2.45 billion to $2.485 billion. M&T Bank Corporation by the numbers: M&T Bank is a holding company that owns M&T Bank, other M&T-branded financial companies and Wilmington Trust, NA. The company provides traditional banking and deposit services, plus wealth management expertise. M&T has more than 960 branches, which are concentrated in the northeastern U.S. MTB pays a quarterly dividend of $1.35, for a yield of 2.8%. The bank has raised its dividend annually since 2016, when it paid $0.70 quarterly. MTB specializes in small business and middle market banking with a commitment to personalized customer service. This contributes to a strong deposit base, one of MTB’s operational strengths. The bank's service has been recognized with "Best Bank" awards by Crisil Coalition Greenwich, a benchmarking and analytics provider. M&T had $19.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits and $35.6 billion in investments on the balance sheet as of June 30. In the June quarter, revenue increased 4% versus the prior year and diluted EPS rose 28%. The bank’s provision for credit losses declined 5%, indicating an improving loan portfolio. One trend to watch is M&T's net interest margin (NIM). In the second quarter, M&T's NIM declined 4 basis points. The metric is still higher than it was in the prior year, however. California Water Service Group by the numbers: California Water Service Group provides water utility services and wastewater treatment for more than two million customers in California, Hawaii, New Mexico, Texas and Washington. CWT is the third largest publicly traded water utility in the U.S. CWT pays a quarterly dividend of $0.30, for a yield of 2.7%. The utility company has raised its dividend annually for 59 years. The five-year compound annual growth rate of the dividend is 7.7%. CWT is financially strong and operates a regulated and predictable business —the qualities you want from a reliable dividend stock. The utility grows through infrastructure investment that outpaces depreciation and strategic acquisitions. In 2025 through 2027, CWT leadership expects to increase capital expenditures to more than four times depreciation. In the past 10 years, the target multiple has been three times. The utility has delivered consistent growth in non-GAAP revenue, net income and diluted EPS since 2022. A rate relief action that increased 2024 revenue by $90.3 million skews the growth in GAAP results. In the first quarter 2025, CWT reported adjusted revenue growth of 13% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 214%. Bottom Line The best dividend stocks to buy now aren't necessarily those with the highest yield. With uncertainty on the horizon for the U.S. economy, leaning into proven dividend payers is a smart strategy.

Beatrice Nolan is a reporter at Fortune covering tech. Beatrice previously worked as a tech reporter at Business Insider, covering stories about AI and Big Tech. She's based in Fortune's London office and graduated from the University of York with a bachelor's degree in English. Apple reported blowout earnings on Thursday, beating Wall Street’s predictions with its biggest revenue growth since December 2021. However, the market reaction was muted, with analysts citing concerns over long-term issues including tariffs and AI. The company reached $94 billion for the quarter ending June 28, driven by strong iPhone demand, surging services revenue, and solid performance across international markets, representing a 10% increase from the same time last year. Earnings per share came in at $1.57, well above the $1.43 analysts had forecast. Net income rose 12%, while gross margin ticked up to 46.5%. Despite the positive results, the company received a subdued response from investors, with its stock rising just over 2% in after-hours trading. Apple has already been dealing with a rough year, and the company’s stock price has dropped 17% year to date. “$AAPL shares are up 2% on great news and guidance, underscoring that investors don’t believe it’s sustainable,” Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management’s managing partner, said in an X post. Munster said Apple stock had become a “show-me” story as investors worry about “tariffs, regulatory changes, and Apple’s AI strategy come back to weigh on growth.” The somewhat muted reaction is likely down to a couple of ongoing sore points for Apple: the AI race and President Trump’s tariffs on China and India. The tariffs hit the company slightly less than previously estimated, costing Apple around $800 million rather than the $900 million CEO Tim Cook had predicted in March. Cook said that the impact was mainly in connection with Trump’s tariffs against China that hit “early in the year.” Kate Leaman, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, told Fortune that Apple was clearly nervous about the impact of further tariffs. “The risks to Apple are real,” she said. “Regulation is coming and tariffs are back in the headlines, with the US still locked in negotiations with China. And for firms like Apple, global politics and supply chains still matter a lot.” The tariff issue looks set to get worse for the tech giant before it gets better, with expected cost hits rising next quarter. “For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added,” Cook said on Thursday’s earnings call. “We estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs.” Wedbush’s Dan Ives called tariffs a “problem for Apple” despite the company continuing to focus on production in India and the fact that the majority of iPhones sold in the US are now being made in the country rather than China, which has faced the most aggressive tariffs from the Trump administration. “Trade policy remains unsettled and uncertain, and Apple is acutely aware of the importance of remaining on the right side of the administration, lest it face increasing ire and tariff risk,” Forrester’s VP principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. “It’s no surprise that Tim Cook was very particular in emphasizing several times Apple’s continuing investment in the United States and American innovation.” Apple has faced criticism for years for the company’s apparent failure to capitalize on the AI boom, and the company’s most recent earnings don’t appear to have soothed investors. “AI is the elephant in the room,” Ives, who has been less than impressed with the company’s AI efforts, said in a note. “While Apple is expanding its AI investments internally, the reality is it’s not moving the needle and patience is wearing thin about investors.” Apple has taken a few hits to AI efforts recently, losing at least four prominent AI researchers to Meta’s “Superintelligence” team. In a particularly harsh blow to Apple, Meta successfully managed to lure away the leader of the company’s AI division, Ruoming Pang, with a compensation package reportedly valued at more than $200 million. The hits to Apple’s talent haven’t helped the perception that the company is lagging behind competitors in the AI space. “The AI Revolution is the biggest technology trend in 40 years and right now Apple is watching this from a park bench drinking lemonade while every other Big Tech company is racing ahead like F1 drivers building out its AI strategy and monetization plan,” Ives said. “This continues to be the big problem for Cook as in our opinion, this is a black eye moment for Apple and is the major anchor on the ship.” Despite Cook confirming Apple was ramping up its internal AI investment, some investors, including Ives, are hoping the company will regain some ground through external partnerships or significant M&A. Cook has already signaled the company was “open to M&A that accelerates [Apple’s] roadmap.” Chatterjee called the company’s AI urgency “palpable” and observed a “quiet admission of its sluggishness in the acknowledgement that it may have to lean heavily on acquisition to compress timelines.” Some investors are hoping that Apple will acquire AI darling Perplexity, a fast-growing AI search startup seen as a potential springboard to overhaul Siri and close Apple’s AI gap with rivals like Google and Microsoft. “Rumors swirl about a Perplexity deal, and if that were to happen, it may greatly accelerate the elusive promise of a more effective Siri,” Chatterjee said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: 9 things you shouldn't use AI for at work
URL: https://www.zdnet.com/article/9-things-you-shouldnt-use-ai-for-at-work/
Time Published: 2025-08-01T12:18:57Z
Full Content:
A few weeks ago, I shared with you "9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI - and why." It's full of well-reasoned suggestions and recommendations for how to avoid having an AI produce code that could ruin your whole day. Then, my editor and I got talking, and we realized the whole idea of "when not to use an AI" could apply to work in general. In this article, I present to you nine things you shouldn't use AI for while at work. This is far from a comprehensive list, but it should make you think. Also: This one feature could make GPT-5 a true game changer (if OpenAI gets it right) "Always keep in mind that AI isn't going to read you your Miranda Rights, wrap your personal information in legal protections like HIPAA, or hesitate to disclose your secrets," said LinkedIn Learning AI instructor Pam Baker, the bestselling author of ChatGPT For Dummies and Generative AI For Dummies. "That goes double for work AI, which is monitored closely by your employer. Whatever you do or tell AI can and likely will be used against you at some point." To keep things interesting, read on to the end. There, I share some fun and terrifying stories about how using AI at work can go terribly, horribly, and amusingly wrong. Without further ado, here are nine things you shouldn't do with AI at work. This is an easy one. Every time you give the AI some information, ask yourself how you would feel if it were posted to the company's public blog or wound up on the front page of your industry's trade journal. Also: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use) This concern also includes information that might be subject to disclosure regulations, such as HIPAA for health information or GDPR for personal data for folks operating in the EU. Regardless of what the AI companies tell you, it's best to simply assume that everything you feed into an AI is now grist for the model-training mill. Anything you feed in could later wind up in a response to somebody's prompt, somewhere else. Contracts are designed to be detailed and specific agreements on how two parties will interact. They are considered governing documents, which means that writing a bad contract is like writing bad code. Baaad things will happen. Do not ask AIs for help with contracts. They will make errors and omissions. They will make stuff up. Worse, they will do so while sounding authoritative, so you're more likely to use their advice. Also: You can use Google's Math Olympiad-winning Deep Think AI model now - for a price Also, the terms of a contract are often governed by the contract. In other words, many contracts say that what's actually in the contract is confidential, and that if you share the particulars of your agreement with any outside party, there will be dire consequences. Sharing with an AI, as discussed above, is like publishing on the front page of a blog. Let me be blunt. If you let an AI work on a contract and it makes a mistake, you (not it) will be paying the price for a long, long time. You know the trope where what you share with your lawyer is protected information and can't be used against you? Yeah, your friendly neighborhood AI is not your lawyer. As reported in Futurism, OpenAI CEO (and ChatGPT's principal cheerleader) Sam Altman told podcaster Theo Von that there is no legal confidentiality when using ChatGPT for your legal concerns. Also: Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks you shouldn't trust AI for therapy Earlier, I discussed how AI companies might use your data for training and embed that data in prompt responses. However, Altman took this assertion up a notch. He suggested OpenAI is obligated to share your conversations with ChatGPT if they are subpoenaed by a court. Jessee Bundy, a Knoxville-based attorney, amplified Altman's statement in a tweet: "There's no legal privilege when you use ChatGPT. So if you're pasting in contracts, asking legal questions, or asking it for strategy, you're not getting legal advice. You're generating discoverable evidence. No attorney/client privilege. No confidentiality. No ethical duty. No one to protect you." She summed up her observations with a particularly damning statement: "It might feel private, safe, and convenient. But lawyers are bound to protect you. ChatGPT isn't, and can be used against you." While we're on the topic of guidance, let's hit two other categories where highly trained, licensed, and regulated professionals are available to provide advice: healthcare and finance. Look, it's probably fine to ask ChatGPT to explain a medical or financial concept to you as if you were a five-year-old. But when it comes time to ask for real advice that you plan on considering as you make major decisions, just don't. Let's step away from the liability risk issues and focus on common sense. First, if you're using something like ChatGPT for real advice, you have to know what to ask. If you're not trained in these professions, you might not know. Also: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out Second, ChatGPT and other chatbots can be spectacularly, overwhelmingly, and almost unbelievably wrong. They misconstrue questions, fabricate answers, conflate concepts, and generally provide questionable advice. Ask yourself, are you willing to bet your life or your financial future on something that a people-pleasing robot made up because it thought that's what you wanted to hear? When you ask a chatbot to write something for you, do you claim it as your own? Some folks have told me that because they wrote the prompts, the resulting output is a result of their creativity. Also: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time Yeah? Not so much. Webster's defines "plagiarize" as "to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own," and to "use (another's production) without crediting the source." The dictionary also defines plagiarize as "to commit literary theft: present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source." Does that not sound like what a chatbot does? It sure does "present as new and original an idea…derived from an existing source." Chatbots are trained on existing sources. They then parrot back those sources after adding a bit of spin. Let's be clear. Using an AI and saying its output is yours could cost you your job. The other day, I had a technical question about my Synology server. I filed a support ticket after hours. A bit later, I got an email response from a self-identified support AI. The cool thing was that the answer was complete and just what I needed, so I didn't have to escalate my ticket to a human helper. Also: Is AI overhyped or underhyped? 6 tips to separate fact from fiction But not all AI interactions with customers go that well. Even a year and a half later, I'm still chuckling about the Chevy dealer chatbot that offered a $55,000 Chevy Tahoe truck to a customer for a buck. It's perfectly fine to provide a trained chatbot as one support option to customers. But don't assume it's always going to be right. Ensure customers have the option to talk with a human. And monitor the AI-enabled process. Otherwise, you could be giving away $1 trucks, too. According to a survey by resume-making app Resume Builder, a majority of managers are using AI "to determine raises (78%), promotions (77%), layoffs (66%), and even terminations (64%)." "Why are you firing me?" "It's not my fault. The AI made me do it." Yeah, that. Worse, apparently at least 20% of managers, most of whom haven't been trained in the rights and wrongs of AI usage, are using AIs to make final employment decisions without even bothering to oversee the AI. Also: Open-source skills can save your career when AI comes knocking But here's the rub. Jobs are often governed by labor laws. Despite the current anti-DEI push coming from Washington, bias can still lead to discrimination lawsuits. Even if you haven't technically done anything wrong, defending against a lawsuit can be expensive. If you cause your company to be on the receiving end of a lawsuit because you couldn't be bothered to be human enough to double-check why your AI was canning Janice in accounting, you'll be the next one being handed a pink slip. Don't do it. Just say no. I'm going to tell you a little secret. Journalists and writers do not exist solely to promote your company. We'd like to help, certainly. It feels good knowing we're helping folks grow their businesses. But, and you'll need to sit down for this news, there are other companies. We are also busy. I get thousands of emails every day. Hundreds of them are about the newest and by far most innovative AI company ever. Many of those pitches are AI-generated because the PR folks couldn't be bothered to take the time to focus their pitch. Some of them are so bad that I can't even tell what the PRs are trying to hawk. But then, there's the other side. Sometimes, I'll reach out to a company, willing to use my most valuable resource -- time -- on their behalf. When I get back a response that's AI-driven, I'll either move on to the next company (or mock them on social media). Also: 5 entry-level tech jobs AI is already augmenting, according to Amazon Some of those AI-driven answers are really, really inappropriate. However, because the AI is representing the company instead of, you know, maybe a thinking human, an opportunity is lost. Keep in mind that I don't like publishing things that will cost someone their job. But other writers are not necessarily similarly inclined. A properly run business will not only use a human to respond to the press, but will also limit the humans allowed to represent the company to those properly experienced in what to say. Or go ahead and cut corners. I always need fun fodder for my Facebook feed. Earlier, I wrote "9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI," which detailed programming tasks you should avoid passing along to an AI. I've long been nervous about ceding too much responsibility to an AI, and quite concerned about managing codebase maintenance. But I didn't really understand how far stupid could go when it came to delegating coding responsibility to the AI. I mean, yes, I know AIs can be stupid. And I sure know humans can be stupid. But when AIs and humans work in tandem to advance the cause of their stupidity together, the results can be truly awe-inspiring. In "Bad vibes: How an AI agent coded its way to disaster," my ZDNET colleague Steven Vaughan-Nichols wrote about a developer who happily vibe-coded himself to an almost-complete piece of software. First, the AI hard-coded lies about how unit tests performed. Then the AI deleted his entire codebase. It's not necessarily wrong to use AI to help you code. But if you're using a tool that can't be backed up, or you don't bother to back up your code first, you're simply doing your best to earn a digital Darwin award. Here's a lightning round of boneheaded moves using AI. They're just too good (and by good, I mean bad) not to recount: What about you? Have you seen an AI go off the rails at work? Have you ever been tempted to delegate a task to a chatbot that, in hindsight, probably needed a human touch? Do you trust AI to handle sensitive data, communicate with customers, or make decisions that affect people's lives? Where do you draw the line in your work? Let us know in the comments below.

Title: International Insider: C-Suite Reorgs Hit International; UK Agency Shakeup; Mubi Investor Spotlighted

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Good afternoon Insiders, the summer holidays have arrived but it’s been a busy old week, and Max Goldbart is here to guide you through. After today, we’re going to take a little August break from both the International Insider newsletter and our Global Breakouts strand, but we will be back with you early September. In the meantime, our crack team will bring you the very latest news and analysis, day in, day out. For now, read on or sign up here. WBD & Paramount Reorgs Hit International Seismic shifts: We at Deadline International like to be on hand to tease out how major changes in the American media landscape impact international. What better week than when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) set out its post-split leadership team and the protracted Paramount-Skydance merger moved to its next phase. WBD is forging a streaming and studios Warner Bros. division under David Zaslav, which will be distinct from the Discovery Global networks division led by ex-WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. International, for the most part, has moved under Wiedenfels, with ex-WBD Lat Am boss Fernando Medin taking on the President of International role and his sort-of predecessor Gerhard Zeiler effectively promoted to become President of Discovery Global in the U.S., UK and Germany. Yet the announcement was devoid of information about the Warner Bros. International TV Production studio, which has bases in multiple countries and makes some of Warner’s biggest unscripted hits around the world. Rather than being folded in with the rest of the American Warner studios, WBITVP will in fact become part of Discovery Global, we revealed Tuesday. There was speculation that there was a tussle between Warner Bros. and Discovery Global over where WBITVP would sit, but the latter ended up making the most sense due in part to WBITVP boss Ronald Goes’ relationship with Zeiler, who has a keen understanding of international production. So far, WBITVP employees are hopeful the split won’t lead to layoffs, which has been a concern for those working at rival Paramount’s international assets around the world as the $8.4B Paramount-Skydance merger completes. Staffers at Paramount-owned UK network Channel 5 are said to be “anxious” about what comes next. Deadline went deep to reveal more of these concerns. Change is coming in America, and as ever it’s spreading overseas. Related Stories Executives Top TV Executive Nina L. Diaz To Depart Paramount When Skydance Merger Is Completed: "I'm Incredibly Proud Of What We've Built" Executives Tom Ryan Departing As President & CEO Of Paramount Streaming As Skydance Sets New Team UK Agency Shakeup Watch on Deadline Exodus: Big shakeup in the UK agenting space this week with a whopping four out of five partners at Hamilton Hodell moving to management firm B-Side. This represents a serious exodus of senior agents. Alexander Cooke, Madeleine Dewhirst, Christopher Farrar and Sian Smyth are all joining the leadership team at B-Side from today (August 1), taking huge stars including Naomi Ackie, Aaron Pierre, Daisy Edgar-Jones, Emilia Clarke, Sophie Wilde, Leo Woodall, Anthony Boyle, Lola Petticrew, Martin Compston and Camille Cottin with them. B-Side, which already reps the likes of Daniel Kaluuya and Barry Keoghan, is no stranger to ship-jumping, having been launched four years ago by four former Troika reps who kicked off with an impressive client list. The move is just the latest to shake up the ever-bustling UK agenting space, which has been alive and busy since the UTA acquisition of Curtis Brown. It provides a reminder of the power of British talent. For now, Hamilton Hodell stays strong with at least half a dozen agents remaining with mega talent such as Tilda Swinton, Ben Whishaw and Emma Thompson. “I’m very proud of my brilliant team of agents, associates and support staff at HH and we will continue to provide the very best representation for extraordinary talent,” said CEO Christian Hodell, who has been with the agency for more than three decades. Netflix ❤️ MBC You know what I MENA?: Big moves in the MENA region as Netflix continues its path to world aggregation domination with a landmark deal struck with the Middle East’s MBC Group. The deal, described as “innovative” by those closest to it, will see customers of MBCNOW – MBC’s recently launched entertainment service aggregator – given access to the full Netflix service, alongside MBC’s Shahid streaming channels and linear TV channels, in one subscription. Netflix already performs well in the region but simultaneously faces stiff competition from Shahid, so this feels a case of, ‘If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.’ The streamer has spent recent weeks unveiling these kinds of deal around the world, including the landmark TF1 tie-up, and so it appears that local aggregation now matters as much to Netflix as local commissioning. On the latter, Netflix yesterday unveiled a 10-strong slate in another priority region, Colombia, including a documentary about soccer superstar James Rodríguez. The streamer has pushed heavily into Latin American programming with the One Hundred Years of Solitude adaptation being its biggest effort out of Colombia to date. Can’t Escape YouTube Even the boomers love it: Ofcom’s Media Nations report spotlighting the UK TV industry’s previous 12 months always provides a bounty of talking points and this year all roads led to YouTube. The Google-owned behemoth is all the rage in TV circles and Media Nations unearthed research finding that YouTube is now the second most-watched service in the UK, behind only the BBC and ahead of the likes of ITV and Netflix. While young people no doubt love a bit of YouTube, interesting findings included a doubling of viewing from over-55s, most of which takes place on smart TV sets rather than phones. Half of the platform’s top-trending videos now more closely resemble traditional TV, including long-form interviews and game shows, Ofcom said. Chatter about how traditional broadcasters and super-indies can best leverage YouTube rather than bowing to its power will likely dominate over coming months. Upon the announcement of its half-year results, Big Brother super-producer Banijay Entertainment touted plans to “enhance our presence on YouTube specifically.” It’s not been all roses for YouTube this week, however, with Australia’s Prime Minister revealing he officially wants to include YouTube in the nation’s world-first social media ban for under 16s. Google, in response, has warned the Australian government that it could go down the legal route. Mubi Investor In Spotlight “Sometimes in life, you just gotta say no”: Mubi has in recent years nurtured a reputation for being an independent auteurs’ dream, but the distributor has been in the spotlight these past days for altogether different reasons. In fact, it has angered several such auteurs. On Wednesday, Mubi received pushback from a number of filmmakers with connections to the distributor – including Radu Jude, Sarah Friedland, Joshua Oppenheimer and Cherien Dabis – over a recent $100M investment it received from Silicon Valley-based private equity firm Sequoia Capital. The issue stems from Sequoia having backed a number of Israeli military technology companies since October 7. The filmmakers suggested these investments tied Mubi to the ongoing violence in Gaza, where more than 60,000 people are reported to have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military campaign. Things got worse for Mubi when one of the letter’s supporters, Eddie Huang, said Mubi had shelved his latest project over his criticism of ties to Sequoia. “I know I did the right thing,” said Huang. “I’m not gonna be gaslit into thinking I didn’t. Sometimes in life, you just gotta say no.” Responding, Mubi has said the Sequoia partnership is there “to accelerate” its “mission of delivering bold and visionary films to global audiences,” while noting Sequoia’s investments do “not reflect the views of Mubi.” The Essentials 🌶️ Hot One: The name’s Knight… Steven Knight has been set to pen the next James Bond movie, a “bucket list” achievement. 🌶️ Another One: Der Tiger has become the first Amazon MGM Studios Germany feature to land a local theatrical release. 🌶️ More: House of the Dragon S3 has cast Red Skies star Annie Shapero as fierce warrior Alysanne Blackwood. 🪓 Breaking Baz: Gurinder Chadha is penning a sequel to 1990s cult hit Bend it Like Beckham. 🫵 Accused: Christopher Nolan has been criticized for shooting elements of all-star epic The Odyssey in the Morocco-occupied Western Sahara. 📊 Results: In half-year earnings week, Canal+ revenue fell 3.3%, TF1 was helped along by its North American studio and ProSiebenSat. 1 was hit by economic uncertainty. 🚪 Exiting: Good Morning Britain U.S. correspondent Noel Phillips amid job cuts. 🤝 Done deal: My Octopus Teacher maker Off the Fence has been rescued from bankruptcy by Insight TV. 🏆Oscars: The International feature contest 2026 is ago with Turkey’s One of the Days When Hemme Dies from Murat Fıratoğlu. 🤖 Robots are coming: Korea’s Culture Minister nominee said he wants to better integrate AI technology into the industry. 🏕️ Festival latest: Pedro Almodóvar collaborator Esther García will be feted at San Sebastian. 🍿 Box office: Sara told us Indian Box Office hit Saiyaara has defied the odds to become the second highest-grossing Indian film of the year. 🎥 Trailer: For The Birthday Party, the Willem Dafoe-led drama headed to Locarno.

Title: The Making of Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Dario Amodei doesn’t hesitate when I ask what’s gotten into him. The Anthropic CEO has spent 2025 at war, feuding with industry counterparts, members of the government, and the public’s perception of artificial intelligence. In recent months, he’s predicted that AI could soon eliminate 50% of entry-level, white-collar jobs. He’s railed against a ten-year AI regulation moratorium in the pages of the New York Times. And he’s called for semiconductor export controls to China, drawing a public rebuke from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Amid it all, Amodei meets me on the first floor of his company’s downtown San Francisco headquarters. He’s loose, energetic, and anxious to get started, as if he’s been waiting for this moment to address his actions. Sporting a blue shawl-collar sweater over a casual white t-shirt, and boxy thick-rimmed glasses, he sits down and stares ahead. Underlying his efforts, Amodei says, is a firm belief that AI is moving faster than most of us appreciate, making its opportunities and consequences much closer than they appear. “I am indeed one of the most bullish about AI capabilities improving very fast,” he tells me. “As we've gotten more close to AI systems that are more powerful, I've wanted to say those things more forcefully, more publicly, to make the point clearer.” Amodei’s outspokenness and sharp elbows have earned him both respect and derision in Silicon Valley. He’s seen by some as a technological visionary who pioneered OpenAI’s GPT-3 project (the seeds of ChatGPT) and a safety-minded leader who broke off and founded Anthropic. Others see him as a control-oriented “doomer” who wants to slow AI progress, shape it to his liking, and shut out the competition. Love him or hate him, the AI field will have to deal with him. Amodei has turned Anthropic, currently valued at $61 billion, into an economic force. From a zero start in 2021, the company — though still unprofitable — has grown its annualized recurring revenue from $1.4 billion in March 2025 to $3 billion in May to nearly $4.5 billion in July, leading Amodei to call it the “fastest growing software company in history at the scale that it's at.” Perhaps more notable than Anthropic’s revenue is the way it’s coming in. Rather than relying primarily on applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Amodei’s biggest bet is on the underlying technology itself. Most of the company’s revenue, Amodei tells me, is earned via its API, or through other companies buying Anthropic’s AI models and using them within their own products. Anthropic will thus be a barometer of AI’s progress, rising and falling on the strength of the technology. As Anthropic grows, Amodei hopes its heft will help him influence the industry’s direction. And given his willingness to speak out, throw a punch, and take one, he’s probably right. So if this man will steer what may be the world’s most influential new technology, it’s worth understanding what drives him, his business, and why his timeline is shorter than so many others’. And after more than two dozen interviews with him, his friends, colleagues, and competitors, I believe I have an answer. Dario Amodei was a science kid. Born in San Francisco in 1983 to a Jewish mother and an Italian father, he was interested almost entirely in math and physics. When the dot-com boom exploded around him in his high school years, it barely registered. “Writing some website actually had no interest to me whatsoever,” he tells me. “I was interested in discovering fundamental scientific truth.” At home, Amodei was very close with his parents, a loving couple who he says sought to improve the world. His mother Elena Engel ran renovation and construction projects for libraries in Berkeley and San Francisco. His father Riccardo Amodei was a trained leathersmith. “They gave me a sense of right and wrong and what was important in the world,” he says, “imbuing a strong sense of responsibility.” That sense of responsibility showed up in Amodei’s undergrad years at Caltech, where he lambasted his fellow students over their passivity toward the forthcoming Iraq war. “The problem isn't that everyone is just peachy with the idea of bombing Iraq; it's that most people are opposed in principle but refuse to give one millisecond of their time,” Amodei wrote in The California Tech, a student newspaper, on March 3, 2003. “This needs to change, right now and without delay.” Then, in his early 20s, Amodei’s life changed forever. His father Riccardo, who’d long fought a rare illness, lost the battle in 2006. Riccardo’s passing shocked Amodei, and he shifted his graduate studies at Princeton from theoretical physics to biology to address human illness and biological problems. The rest of Amodei’s life has, in some ways, been dedicated to addressing his father’s loss, especially because within four years, a new breakthrough turned the illness from something that was 50% fatal to 95% curable. “There was someone who worked on the cure to this disease, that managed to cure it, and save a bunch of people's lives,” Amodei says, “but could have saved even more.” “I get really angry when someone's like, “This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down’” - Dario Amodei Amodei’s father’s passing has shaped his life’s path to this day, says Jade Wang, who dated him in the early 2010s. “It's the difference between his father most likely dying and most likely living, okay?,” she says, explaining that had scientific progress sped up a bit, Amodei’s father might still be with us. It just took a while before he found AI as a vessel to do it. Upon recalling his father’s death, Amodei grows animated. His calls for export controls and AI safeguards, he believes, have been mischaracterized as the actions of someone irrationally seeking to impede AI progress. “I get really angry when someone's like, ‘This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down,’” Amodei tells me. “You heard what I just said, my father died because of cures that could have happened a few years [earlier]. I understand the benefit of this technology.” At Princeton, still raw from his father’s loss, Amodei began his quest to decode human biology by studying the retina. Our eyes capture the world by sending signals to the visual cortex — a large part of the brain that takes up 30% of the cerebral cortex — which then processes the data and shows us a picture. If you’re looking to tackle the complexity of the human physiology, the retina is a great place to start. “He used the retina to look at a complete neural population and actually understand what every cell was doing, or at least have that opportunity,” Stephanie Palmer, one of Amodei’s contemporaries at Princeton, tells me. “It was about that more than the eye. He wasn't trying to be an ophthalmologist.” Working in Professor Michael Berry’s retina lab, Amodei was so dissatisfied with the methods available to measure the retina’s signals that he co-invented a new, better sensor to pick up more data. This was atypical for the lab, at once impressive and nonconformist. His dissertation won the Hertz Thesis Prize, a prestigious award granted to those who discover real-world applications in their academic work. But Amodei’s penchant for poking at norms, and his strident sense of the way things should be, set him apart in an academic setting. Berry tells me that Amodei was the most talented graduate student he ever had, but his focus on technological progress and teamwork didn’t play well in a system built to recognize individual achievement. “I think internally, he was kind of a proud person,” Berry tells me. “I imagine his whole academic career up until that point, whenever he did something, people would stand up and clap. And that was not really happening here.” “He wasn't trying to be an ophthalmologist.” - Stephanie Palmer When Amodei left Princeton, the door to AI opened. He began postdoc work under researcher Parag Mallick at Stanford, studying proteins in and around tumors to detect metastatic cancer cells. The work was complex, showing Amodei the limits of what people could do alone, and he started looking for technological solutions. “The complexity of the underlying problems in biology felt like it was beyond human scale,” Amodei tells me. “In order to understand it all, you needed hundreds, thousands of human researchers.” Amodei saw that potential in emerging AI technologies. At the time, an explosion of data and computing power was sparking breakthroughs in machine learning, a subset of AI that long held theoretical potential but had shown middling results until then. After Amodei began experimenting with the technology, he realized it might eventually stand in for those thousands of researchers. “AI, which I was just starting to see the discoveries in, felt to me like the only technology that could kind of bridge that gap,” he says, something that “could bring us beyond human scale.” Amodei left academia to pursue AI advancement in the corporate world, which had the cash to support it. He considered founding a startup, then leaned toward Google, which had a well-funded AI research division in Google Brain and just acquired DeepMind. But Chinese search engine Baidu had handed the esteemed researcher Andrew Ng a $100 million budget to research and deploy AI, and he began to form a superteam. Ng reached out to Amodei, who was intrigued and applied. When Amodei’s application arrived at Baidu, the full team didn't know what to do with it. “He had an impressive background, but his background, from our perspective, was in biology. It was not in machine learning,” Greg Diamos, an early member of the team, tells me. Diamos then looked at Amodei’s code from Stanford, and encouraged the team to hire him. “I was thinking, anyone who can write this has got to be an amazingly good programmer,” he says. Amodei joined Baidu in November 2014. Related Article: Unveiling the Past and Future of Generative AI With their vast resources, the Baidu team could throw computing power and data at problems in an attempt to improve their outcomes. They saw remarkable results. In their experiments, Amodei and his colleagues found that AI’s performance improved meaningfully as they added more of these ingredients. The team released a paper on speech recognition that showed that model size directly correlated with performance. “It had a big impact on me, because I saw these very smooth trends,” Amodei says. Amodei’s early work at Baidu contributed to what’s known as the AI “scaling laws,” which are really more of an observation. The scaling laws state that increasing computing power, data, and model size in AI training leads to predictable performance improvements. Scaling everything up, in other words, makes AI better, no novel methods needed. “This was, to me, the most significant discovery I've seen in my life,” Diamos tells me. How different scaling factors improve model performance, based on early experiments by Amodei and peers. To this day, Amodei is perhaps the purest believer in the scaling laws among AI research leaders. While peers like Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun suggest the AI industry needs further breakthroughs to reach human-level artificial intelligence, Amodei speaks with a certainty — though not complete — that the path forward is clear. And as the industry erects massive data centers the size of small cities, he sees exceptionally powerful AI fast approaching. “I see this exponential,” he says. “When you're on an exponential, you can really get fooled by it. Two years away from when the exponential goes totally crazy it looks like it's just starting.” At Baidu, the AI team’s progress became seeds of its undoing. Turf battles broke out within the company over control of its increasingly valuable technology, know-how, and resources. Eventually, meddling from powerbrokers in China sparked a talent exodus and the lab fell apart. Andrew Ng declined to comment. As Baidu’s AI team crumbled, Elon Musk invited Amodei and a number of leading AI researchers to a now-famous dinner at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park. Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever all attended. Seeing AI’s emerging potential, and concerned Google could solidify control over it, Musk decided to fund a new competitor, which became OpenAI. Altman, Brockman, and Sutskever co-founded the new research house with Musk. Amodei thought about joining, felt unsure about the fledgling organization, and went to Google Brain instead. After ten months stuck in large-company morass at Google, Amodei reconsidered. He joined OpenAI in 2016, and got to work on AI safety. He’d grown interested in safety at Google, where he worried about the rapidly improving technology’s capacity for harm and co-authored a paper on its potential for bad behavior. As Amodei settled in at OpenAI, his former Google colleagues introduced the transformer model, the technology behind today’s generative AI moment, in a paper called “Attention is All You Need.” The transformer enabled faster training and much larger models than prior methods. Despite the discovery’s great potential, Google mostly sat on it. OpenAI, meanwhile, got to work. It released its first large language model called “GPT” (the “T” stands for transformer) in 2018. The model generated often-broken text but still demonstrated meaningful improvement over previous language generation methods. Amodei, who’d become a research director at OpenAI, got directly involved in the next iteration, GPT-2, which was effectively the same model as GPT, just bigger. The OpenAI team fine-tuned GPT-2 with a technique called reinforcement learning with human feedback, something Amodei helped pioneer, which helped guide its values. GPT-2 delivered much better results than GPT, as expected, showing an ability to paraphrase, write, and answer questions somewhat coherently. Language models soon became the focal point at OpenAI. As Amodei’s profile increased within OpenAI, so did the controversy around him. A prolific writer, he’d produce long documents about values and technology, which some colleagues saw as inspirational but others saw as flag planting and heavy handed. (One such memo: an exploration of “M” companies vs. “P” companies, where Ms provide market-focused goods and Ps provide public-focused goods). Amodei, to some, was also too focused on maintaining secrecy around the technology’s potential and collaborating with the government to address it. And he could be a bit abrasive, sometimes disparaging projects he didn’t believe in. OpenAI still entrusted Amodei with the leadership of the GPT-3 project, handing him 50-60% of the entire company’s compute to build a massively scaled up version of its language model. The jump from GPT to GPT-2 was large, a ten-fold increase. But the jump from GPT-2 to GPT-3 would be massive, a 100x project costing tens of millions of dollars. The results were stunning. The New York Times quoted independent researchers surprised by the GPT-3’s ability to code, summarize, and translate. Amodei, who was relatively restrained upon the release of GPT-2, gushed about his new model. “It has this emergent quality,” hed told the Times. “It has some ability to recognize the pattern that you gave it and complete the story.” But cracks beneath the surface at OpenAI began to tear wide open. With the creation of GPT-3, the first capable language model, the stakes for Amodei increased. After seeing the scaling laws work in multiple disciplines at this point, Amodei considered where the technology was headed and developed an even greater interest in safety. “He looked at this technology and assumed it would work,” Jack Clark, a close colleague of Amodei’s at OpenAI, tells me. “And if you assume it works, in the sense that it's going to be as smart as a person, you can't help but be concerned of the safety things in some sense.” Though Amodei led OpenAI’s model development, and directed a good chunk of its compute, parts of the company were out of his hands. This included deciding when to release models, personnel matters, how the company deploys its technology, and how it represents itself externally. “Many of those things,” Amodei says, “are not things that you control just by training the models.” Amodei, by then, had formed a tight-knit group of coworkers around him — which some called “the pandas,” due to his love of the animal — and had very different ideas from OpenAI leadership about how to handle these functions. Infighting ensued, and the factions developed an intense dislike for each other. “He believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it” - Jensen Huang In our conversation, Amodei didn’t mask his feelings. “The leaders of a company, they have to be trustworthy people,” he says. “They have to be people whose motivations are sincere, no matter how much you're driving forward the company technically. If you're working for someone whose motivations are not sincere, who's not an honest person, who does not truly want to make the world better, it's not going to work. You're just contributing to something bad.” Within OpenAI, some saw Amodei’s focus on safety as a route to control the company altogether. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently echoed these criticisms after Amodei called for GPU export controls to China. “He believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it,” Huang said. “That's the most outrageous lie I've ever heard,” Amodei tells me of Huang’s claim, adding he’s always wanted to spark a ‘race to the top’ by encouraging others to emulate Anthropic’s safety practices. “I’ve said nothing that anywhere near resembles the idea that this company should be the only one to build the technology. I don't know how anyone could ever derive that from anything that I've said. It’s just an incredible and bad faith distortion.” My full conversation with Amodei will be live on Big Technology Podcast. You can subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your app of choice. Nvidia, which just won a rollback of some of Amodei’s favored export controls, doubled down. "We support safe, responsible, and transparent AI. Thousands of startups and developers in our ecosystem and the open-source community are enhancing safety,” an Nvidia spokesperson tells me. “Lobbying for regulatory capture against open source will only stifle innovation, make AI less safe and secure, and less democratic. That's not a 'race to the top' or the way for America to win." OpenAI hit back as well, via a company spokesperson. “We’ve always believed that AI should benefit and empower everyone, not just those who say it’s too risky for anyone but themselves to develop safely,” the spokesperson says. “As the technology has evolved, our decisions on partnerships, model releases, and funding have become standard across the industry, including at Anthropic. What hasn’t changed is our focus on making AI safe, useful, and available to as many people as possible.” Over time, the differences between Amodei’s group and OpenAI’s leaders became so untenable that something had to give. “Fifty percent of our time was spent trying to convince other people of views that we held, and fifty percent was spent working,” Clark says. So in December 2020, Amodei, Clark, Amodei’s sister Daniela, researcher Chris Olah, and a handful of others departed OpenAI to start something new. In a conference room within Anthropic offices, Clark turns around his laptop and displays one of Anthropic’s earliest documents. It’s a list of names including Aligned AI, Generative, Sponge, Swan, Sloth, and Sparrow Systems. Anthropic, a word that connotes being human centered and human oriented, is also there, and it also happened to be an available domain name in early 2021. “We like the name it is good,” the team wrote in the spreadsheet. And thus, Anthropic was born. Anthropic was formed in the heart of Covid, meeting entirely on Zoom amid the pandemic’s second wave. Eventually, its 15 to 20 employees would meet for weekly lunches in San Francisco’s Precita Park, pulling up their own chairs to talk business. The company’s early mission was simple: Build leading large language models, implement safe practices to pressure others to follow, and publish what it learned, apart from its models’ core technical details. It might sound odd that the group of less than two dozen people meeting in a park with their own chairs would feel a sense of destiny, especially since they’d need billions of dollars to see their mission through, but that was the vibe in Anthropic’s early days. “The strangest thing about all of this is how inevitable so much of it felt to people on the inside,” Clark says. “We've done scaling laws. We could see the path to the models getting good.” Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt was among Anthropic’s first investors. He’d met Amodei through his then-girlfriend and now wife, who Schmidt knew socially. The two talked technology when Amodei was still at OpenAI, and business when he started Anthropic. Schmidt tells me he invested in the person more than the concept. “At this level, when you're doing an investment like that, you have essentially no data, right?” he says. “You don't know what the revenue is. You don't know the market. You don't know what the product is. And so you fundamentally have to decide based on the people. And Dario is a brilliant scientist, and he promised to hire brilliant scientists, which he did. He promised to lead a very small company doing it, which he did not. Now it's a very large company, and now it's a normal company. I figured it would be a very interesting research lab.” Now-disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was also among Anthropic’s early investors, directing a reported $500 million from FTX’s coffers for a 13.56% stake in the company. Bankman-Fried was one of a number of effective altruists who invested in Anthropic’s early stages, when the movement and company were close. Amodei says SBF was an AI bull interested in safety, a good fit, but had sufficient red flags to keep him off the board and give him non-voting shares. SBF’s behavior, Amodei says, “turned out to be much, much, much more extreme and bad than I ever imagined.” Amodei’s pitch to prospective investors was simple: He told them Anthropic had the talent to build cutting-edge models at a tenth of the cost. And it worked. To date, Amodei’s brought in nearly $20 billion, including $8 billion from Amazon and $3 billion from Google. “Investors aren't idiots,” he tells me. “They basically understand the concept of capital efficiency.” In Anthropic’s second year, OpenAI introduced generative AI to the world with ChatGPT, but Anthropic took a different path. Rather than focus on consumer applications, Amodei decided Anthropic would sell its technology to businesses. There were two benefits to this strategy. If the models were useful it could be lucrative, and the challenge would prod the company into building better technology. Improving an AI model from undergrad to graduate level in biochemistry might not excite the common chatbot user, Amodei says, but it would be valuable to a pharmaceutical company like Pfizer. “It gives a better incentive to develop the models as far as possible,” he says. Oddly enough, it was an Anthropic consumer product that got businesses to pay attention to its technology. The company released its Claude chatbot in July 2023, nearly a year after ChatGPT’s debut, and it drew rave reviews due to its high-EQ personality (an outgrowth of Anthropic’s safety work). The company, until then, had sought to remain under 150 employees, but soon found itself hiring more people in a day than it employed in total in its entire first year. “It was that Claude chatbot moment when the company started to grow a lot,” Clark says. Amodei’s bet on building AI for business use cases attracted loads of eager customers. Anthropic’s now sold its large language models across multiple industries — travel, healthcare, financial services, insurance, and more — including to leaders like Pfizer, United Airlines, and AIG. The Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk is, for instance, using Anthropic to condense a fifteen-day regulatory report compilation process into ten minutes. Related Article: AI‑Augmented CX: The New Horizon of Customer Service Examples of how major industries are leveraging Claude’s capabilities for business outcomes. “The technology we've built ends up taking care of a lot of the stuff that people complain the most about their work,” Kate Jensen, Anthropic’s head of revenue, tells me. Coders, meanwhile, have fallen in love with Anthropic. The company focused on AI code generation both because it could help speed its model development and because coders would adopt it quickly if it worked well enough. Sure enough, the use cases exploded and have coincided with — or caused — the rise of AI coding tools like Cursor. Anthropic is also getting into the coding application business itself. It released Claude Code, an AI coding tool, in February 2025. As AI usage booms, the company’s revenue is as well. “Anthropic’s revenue every year has grown 10x,” Amodei says. “We went from zero to $100 million in 2023. We went from $100 million to a billion in 2024. And this year, in this first half of the year, we've gone from $1 billion to I think, as of speaking today, it’s well above $4 [billion], it might be $4.5 [billion].” The last figure is annualized, or 12x the month’s revenue. Anthropic’s 8 and 9 figure deals have tripled in 2025 vs. 2024, the company says, and its business customers have spent 5x more on average. But Anthropic is spending a lot of money to train and run its models, raising questions about whether its business model is sustainable. The company is deeply unprofitable, expected to lose about $3 billion this year. And its gross margins have also reportedly lagged behind typical cloud software companies. Some of Anthropic’s customers are wondering if the company’s attempt to sort out its business is showing up in the product. One startup founder told me that while Anthropic is the best model for his use case, he can’t rely on it because it’s down too often. Amjad Masad, CEO of vibe coding company Replit, told me the cost to use its models has stopped coming down after a period of price decreases. Claude Code also just added additional rate limits after some developers used it so much it became bad business. Entrepreneur and developer Kieran Klaassen tells me that he got $6,000 worth of Claude API usage in one month for just the $200 Max subscription price. Klaassen says he’s run multiple Claude agents at a time. “The real limit comes in your mental capacity to switch from one to the other,” he says. Amodei says that as Anthropic’s models improve, customers will get a better deal if costs stay the same, effectively buying more intelligence per dollar. He also says that AI labs are just beginning to optimize for inference, or the act of using the models, which should lead to efficiency improvements. This is a place to pay attention. Multiple industry sources told me inference costs must drop for the business to make sense. Anthropic’s executives, in their interviews with me, suggest there are worse problems than high demand for your product. The open question is whether generative AI, and the scaling laws that propel it, will neatly follow other technology’s cost reduction curves, or whether it’s a novel technology with a novel cost. The only sure thing is it’ll take a lot more money to find out. Related Articles: 5 Predictions for the AI Roadmap At the beginning of 2025, Anthropic needed cash. The AI industry’s hunger for scale had catalyzed massive data center buildouts and compute deals. To support these undertakings, AI labs had repeatedly smashed startup fundraising records. And established companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon used their sizable profits and data centers to build their own models, turning up the pressure. Anthropic has a special imperative to build large. Without a powerhouse application like ChatGPT, where users come back out of habit, its models must lead in their use cases or risk being swapped out for a competitor. “In the corporate space, and especially in coding, there’s very clearly an advantage to be six months or a year ahead of the state of the art,” Box CEO Aaron Levie, an Anthropic customer, tells me. So the company turned to Ravi Mhatre, a veteran venture capitalist and partner at Lightspeed Ventures, to lead a $3.5 billion funding round. Mhatre used to write $5 or $10-million checks, but the one he was readying to cut would be among his firm’s largest. “Amazon went public with a $400 million market cap,” he tells me. “$400 million! Think about that today.” The fundraise was proceeding as planned when a cheap, competing AI model dropped seemingly out of thin air. The Chinese hedge fund High Flyer released DeepSeek R1, an open-source, capable, and efficient reasoning model that it priced forty times lower than its peers. DeepSeek shocked the business world and had multi-trillion-dollar CEOs tweeting Wikipedia articles to calm shareholders. By the time DeepSeek arrived, Mhatre had completed a full projection of why the AI models themselves, not the chatbots of the world, would generate the most value. He concluded that creating artificial intelligence capable of knowledge work would allow companies to have revenue ten times what the large cloud platforms bring in, leading to a total potential market of $15 to 20 trillion. “So then you work backwards and just say, at $60 billion or $100 billion, could you get a venture-style return? You absolutely could,” he says. “Sometimes it's about how you size the markets top-down.” DeepSeek’s arrival suggested that open source, efficient, almost-as-good models could challenge the incumbents, but Amodei didn’t see it that way. His greatest concern, he says, is whether any new model is better than Anthropic’s. If you can download the model’s designs, you still need to set it up on a cloud service and run it, he says, which takes skill and money. Amodei delivered a version of this argument to Mhatre and his colleagues at Lightspeed as the DeepSeek story took off, convincing them that some of the model’s innovations could be improved with scale. That Monday, Nvidia stock dropped 17% as panicked investors fled the AI infrastructure trade. Amid the uncertainty, the VC made a decision. “I'm not going to tell you that it wasn't extraordinarily stressful,” Mhatre says. “That Monday, we wired $1 billion.” Six months after DeepSeek Monday, Anthropic is looking to scale up yet again. The company is in talks for a new funding round that could reach $5 billion which would double its valuation to $150 billion. The potential investors include some middle eastern Gulf states that Anthropic once seemed eager to steer clear of. But after raising nearly $20 billion from Google, Amazon, and VCs like Lightspeed, it’s running out of options for bigger checks. “I'm not going to tell you that it wasn't extraordinarily stressful. That Monday, we wired $1 billion.” - Ravi Mhatre Within Anthropic, Amodei has argued the Gulf states have $100 billion or more in capital to invest, and their cash would help Anthropic stay on the technology’s frontier. He seemed to reluctantly accept the idea of taking the money from dictators in an internal Slack message obtained by Wired. “Unfortunately,” he wrote. “I think ‘No bad person should ever benefit from our success’ is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.” Speaking with Amodei makes me wonder how, or if, this race to improve AI will end. I imagine the models might eventually get so big, and so good, they commoditize. Or perhaps, as Amodei’s former colleague Ilya Sutskever once suggested, the endless drive to scale ends up covering the planet with solar panels and datacenters. There’s also another possibility, one AI believers don’t like to discuss: AI improvement plateaus, leading to a historic investor wipeout. At Anthropic’s first developer conference in May, I grab a seat a few rows from the stage and await Amodei’s appearance. The company’s packed The Midway — an airy arts and events venue in San Francisco’s Dogpatch neighborhood — with coders, press, and many of its now 1,000+ employees. There’s broad anticipation inside that Anthropic will release Claude 4, its latest, biggest model. Amodei takes the stage and introduces Claude 4. Instead of a flashy presentation, he picks up a handheld mic, makes the announcement, reads his notes from a laptop, and then turns the spotlight over to Anthropic product head Mike Krieger. The crowd seems into it. Amodei’s promise of what’s coming next, to me, is more notable than the model update itself. Throughout the day, he repeatedly mentions that AI development is speeding up, and that Anthropic’s next model releases will come faster. “I don't know exactly how much more frequent,” he says. “But the pace is increasing,” Anthropic, as Amodei’s told me, has been developing AI coding tools to speed up its model development. When I bring this up to Jared Kaplan, the company’s co-founder and chief scientist, he tells me it’s working. “Most engineers at Anthropic use AI to help them be more productive,” he says. “So it's definitely speeding us up quite a bit.” There’s a concept in AI theory called an intelligence explosion, where the model is able to make itself better and then — fffffoooooom — self-improves and become all mighty. Kaplan doesn’t dismiss the notion that an intelligence explosion might arrive via this method, or perhaps a human-assisted version. “It could be two or three years away. Could take longer. Could take much longer,” Kaplan says. “But when I say there’s a 50% chance of AI being able to do all the things that knowledge workers do, one of the things we do is train AI models.” “Maybe people like me won't really have much to do,” Kaplan continues. “It's more complicated than that. But we are quite likely headed towards the future that looks like that.” Amodei’s safety obsession, at this point, comes into clear focus. While nobody within Anthropic says an intelligence explosion is imminent, it’s evident they’re not shying away from moving toward it. If AI is going to get better, faster — and perhaps much faster — it’s worth being careful about its downsides. Some of this theoretical talk clearly helps Anthropic market its services to pharmaceutical companies and developers, but AI models are now coding well enough that it no longer feels completely insane. Jan Leike, the former head of OpenAI’s ‘Superalignment’ team, followed Amodei to Anthropic in 2024 to co-lead its alignment science team. Alignment is the art of tuning AI systems to ensure they are aligned with our values and goals. And Leike believes syncing the machines with our intentions will be crucial should we see the anticipated eruption. “There could be a period of rapid capability progress,” Leike tells me. “You don't want to lose control or lose scalability over a system that's recursively self-improving.” Already, Anthropic and its counterparts have found AI sometimes demonstrates a worrying interest in self-preservation while testing in simulation environments. In Claude 4’s documentation, for instance, Anthropic stated the model repeatedly attempted to blackmail an engineer to avoid being shut down. “You don't want to lose control or lose scalability over a system that's recursively self-improving.” - Jan Leike Anthropic’s also said its AI has worked to deceive evaluators when it thought they might rewrite its values. The model also attempted to copy itself out of Anthropic’s infrastructure in a simulation. Leike says Anthropic is working to discourage these behaviors via reward systems. The field is still experimental. Speaking openly about these issues is part of Amodei’s “race to the top” strategy. Anthropic’s also funded — and advocated for — interpretability, or the science of understanding what takes place within AI models. And it’s published a Responsible Scaling Policy, a framework that sets boundaries for when to release and train models depending on their risks, which has inspired similar efforts among its peers. “The way I think about the race to the top is that it doesn't matter who wins,” Amodei says. “Everyone wins, right?” Amodei’s dedication to AI, forged in the tragedy of his father’s loss, may now have its goal in sight. Today’s AI is already speeding up drug development paperwork, it’s become an (imperfect) medical advisor in a broken medical system, and, if things go right, it may one day stand in for those hundreds or thousands of researchers needed to understand human biology. Could Amodei’s pursuit of this vision, I ask, blind him to the risks of losing control of the technology? “That's not the way I think about it,” he says. “We've gotten better at controlling models with every model that we release. All these things go wrong, but you really have to stress test the models pretty hard.” Amodei sees this line of questioning as rooted in the slow-it-down doomerism he’s often accused of. His plan, contrary to the critics, is to accelerate. “The reason I'm warning about the risk is so that we don't have to slow down,” he says. “I have such an incredible understanding of the stakes. In terms of the benefits, in terms of what it can do, the lives that it can save. I've seen that personally.” Owen Lavine contributed reporting.

Title: Crypto startups raise $2.6bn in July: Here are the winners

About us Copy link Crypto startups are rolling in it. In July, 65 crypto projects raised over $2.6 billion in new investments to grow their businesses, according to DefiLlama. That brings the total amount raised by industry players to $13 billion so far this year, up from the $9.5 billion raised in total in 2024. Pitchbook expects crypto startups to double that figure to $18 billion in 2025. Here are the three crypto projects that raised the most money in July. Pump.fun raised $590 million in an initial coin offering at the beginning of July to, as it boldly proclaimed, “kill Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch” by transforming itself into a new type of social media platform. At a glance, the controversial memecoin generator token sale seems a grand success. Pump.fun’s ICO sold out in just 12 minutes, capping off one of the fastest and largest raises in recent crypto memory. However, the project sold 2 billion fewer tokens than it had originally planned. The project had previously said 150 billion PUMP tokens, out of a 330 billion total ICO allocation, would be offered to the public at $0.004 each. That implied a $600 million raise. But the live dashboard confirms just 148 billion tokens were sold, pulling in $590 million — about 98% of the originally stated public allocation. The sale came in the same month as the platform is struggling with plummeting revenue amid a memecoin slump and an increasingly crowded market. And those traditional social media platforms? Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, saw its stock price surge 11% this week, giving it a market cap of just under $2 trillion, about half of the entire cryptocurrency market. Hong Kong-based OSL Group said it has secured $300 million in equity financing. “The funding will accelerate our global buildout — particularly in regulated payment infrastructure and access points,” Ivan Wong, CFO at OSL Group, said in a statement. Upexi, a Solana treasury company, announced a $200 million deal led by Big Brain Holdings at the beginning of July. The deal took the form of a convertible note offering, and the proceeds will be used to buy more Solana, the company said. Upexi is part of a wave of crypto treasury companies that have cropped up over the past year. While the bulk of them copy Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-buying strategy, many are also allocating resources to buying altcoins.

Title: Dotdash, By The People, For The People; Mopping Up Social

Dashed Off On Tuesday, The Artist Formerly Known as Dotdash Meredith rebranded as People Inc. to reflect its best-known legacy brand. There are a number of reasons for the shift, including the fact that the previous name was simply “too clunky and cumbersome and weird,” Neil Vogel, People Inc.’s chief executive, tells The Wall Street Journal. Rebranding as People Inc. also pays homage to one of the company’s greatest successes: People’s monthly desktop and mobile visits more than doubled between June 2020 and June 2025, the WSJ reports. By comparison, some now former DDM publications, like Vanity Fair, saw a more than 50% decrease in monthly visits. The new name also reflects that “we are people making content for people,” Vogel tells The Hollywood Reporter. In an era of media marked by what Vogel referred to as “synthetic and artificial and amalgamated and mashed up” content, People Inc. will apparently put the “people” in, well, you get it. With print sales declining and media strategies shifting to new channels like TikTok, “we’ve learned that not all of our brands are going to have a future, and that’s okay,” Vogel tells THR. Instead, People will focus its attention on the channels seeing the most success – which, like People magazine, are those with “the history and the gravitas,” according to Vogel. Influence In The Aisle Fortune 500 consumer product brands like Unilever and Estée Lauder are suddenly all in on influencer marketing. Unilever’s new CMO, for one, vowed to spend as much as half of its paid media on influencer marketing. Procter & Gamble, the world’s highest-spending CPG advertiser, provided another example of this trend during its earnings report this week. For the new Swiffer PowerMop launch, P&G brought in TikTok and social media influencers to review the mop and speak with the execs who designed the product, CEO Jon Moeller told investors. The Swiffer team’s footage, together with the content created by influencers, is what P&G used to develop its TV and online video ads, he said. Moeller credited the PowerMop launch with kickstarting 40% growth for Swiffer’s portfolio and driving 35% of category growth, “making it the No. 1 growth driver in the category.” Bite Of The Apple Apple’s iOS 26 is slated to go live this month. One much-ballyhooed feature is the automatic filtering of unknown callers and text message senders to a new folder akin to spam. Politicians and political campaigners are alarmed because those messages are the meat and potatoes of political fundraising, Business Insider reports. Patrick Ruffini, a conservative pollster, notes in a Twitter thread that polling will be deeply affected. Online polls are not reliable and cannot be localized. The best, most reliable polling, like the NYT/Siena poll, relies on the exact methods being targeted by iOS 26. On the other hand, people universally hate the practice and will applaud Apple’s update. And, to be fair, political campaigns brought this on themselves. In 2020, all of the mobile wireless networks promoted their new anti-spam and scam policies, which affected some political messaging practices. A few weeks later, the Trump reelection campaign’s text fundraising campaign was suspended, because all the new systems identified it as spam, if not a scam. This precipitated vast congressional blowback, and the wireless networks later relented on those rules. But Wait! There’s More!

Title: Gloomy guidance and increased cloud competition weigh on Amazon’s stock, despite solid earnings beat

UPDATED 19:36 EDT / JULY 31 2025 by Mike Wheatley Shares of Amazon.com Inc. were trading more than 6% lower after-hours today, after the e-commerce and cloud computing infrastructure giant could only offer light guidance for the current quarter. The decline came in the wake of some fairly decent numbers from Amazon as it posted its second-quarter financial results, beating Wall Street’s targets on earnings and revenue. Amazon reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $1.68 per share, easily beating the $1.33 per share forecast, while revenue for the quarter came to $167.7 billion, up 13% from a year ago and ahead of the $162.09 billion analyst consensus estimate. The company also reported operating income of $19.2 billion for the quarter, up from $14.7 billion in the year-ago period, while net income came to $18.2 billion, up from $13.5 billion 12 months prior. However, what disturbed investors was the company’s miserable operating income outlook. Amazon said this could fall anywhere between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion, but the midpoint of that range is substantially lower than Wall Street’s forecast of $19.48 billion. The guidance appears to have caused panic among investors, who are increasingly concerned about the company’s sky-high artificial intelligence investments. Amazon has previously committed to spending up to $100 billion this year on building out the data centers to run AI models, and software that makes use of them. Amazon’s stock headed south during a conference call, where Chief Executive Andy Jassy (pictured) was busy fielding some tough questions from analysts regarding the level of spending and the increased competition it faces in the cloud. Jassy did his best to emphasize that Amazon retains a “significant” cloud leadership position, adding that he’s “optimistic” about the strength of its AI products and services. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead,” Jassy said in a statement. With regard to the cloud, the Amazon Web Services Inc. business unit delivered total sales of $30.87 billion in the quarter, up 18% from a year ago and just ahead of the Street’s forecast of $30.8 billion. AWS continues to dominate the cloud computing infrastructure market, but its lead isn’t as big as it was, for it faces relentless competition in the face of Microsoft Corp. and Google LLC, and also even smaller players like Oracle Corp. and dedicated AI cloud providers, such as CoreWeave Inc. The company’s substantial lead in cloud makes it much harder for AWS to match those rival’s growth rates. While AWS revenue was up 18%, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud recorded growth rates of 39% and 32% in their most recent quarters, which means they’re slowly chipping away at Amazon’s lead. “We have a meaningfully larger business in the AWS segment than others,” Jassy told analysts in response to a question about the threat posed by those rivals. “I think the second player is about 65% of the size of AWS.” AWS continues to be a major driver of profit for Amazon, generating operating income of $10.2 billion during the quarter, representing just over half of the company’s total. During the quarter, AWS revealed plans to open a new data center region in Chile before 2027, and said Pepsi Co. has signed up for a large multiyear contract that will see it move various critical workloads to the AWS cloud. Jassy insisted that customers continue to choose AWS because they see it as the industry’s most secure cloud infrastructure platform. “For most companies, they’re putting data that they really care about into the cloud,” he told analysts. “The security and privacy of that data matters a lot, and there are very different results in security in AWS than you’ll see in other players.” The results from Amazon’s advertising business were more encouraging, with ad revenue rising 23% from a year earlier to $15.69 billion, surging past the analyst target of $14.99 billion. Of course, the ad business remains much smaller than AWS or the company’s retail business, but it’s still responsible for a growing chunk of Amazon’s profits, as the world’s third-largest ad platform, behind only Google and Meta Platforms Inc. Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. last week reported that ad sales rose 10% in its most recent quarter, while Meta said yesterday that its ad revenue climbed 22%, slightly slower than Amazon’s, both off a bigger base. As for retail, sales in Amazon’s online stores increased 11% from a year earlier to $61.5 billion, surpassing the Street’s target of $59 billion, while the seller services unit delivered $40.3 billion in revenue, also up 11%. Analysts were expecting just $38.7 billion in sales there. Some analysts were more bullish about the company’s prospects. “In the end Amazon operates two high-margin growthy businesses and a massive low-margin logistics business with unmatched scale with the potential to materially juice margins medium to long term using AI in combination with robotics,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak said in a note to clients. The firm raised its target price to $285 a share and reiterated its buy rating. Amazon’s prediction for third-quarter revenue was a little better, at least. The company estimates sales of between $174 billion and $179.5 billion, which would mean growth of between 10% and 13%. That’s more optimistic than the Street, with analysts aiming for just $173.1 billion in third-quarter sales. Once again, Amazon’s guidance came with a caveat that warned how “recessionary fears” and “tariff and trade policies” could yet affect its results in unforeseen ways. The constantly shifting trade polices of U.S. President Donald Trump could potentially have a big impact on Amazon’s retail business, though consumer spending has so far proven resilient this year. On the conference call, Jassy told analysts that the tariffs haven’t impacted on consumer demand, nor have they driven up prices, as some had feared. “If costs end up being a little higher, we will absorb them,” he added. The after-hours price drop means that Amazon’s stock is up just over 6% in the year to date, trailing the broader S&P 500 Index, which has gained 8% in the same period.

Speaking with CNBC, billionaire banking boss Dimon said that stablecoins could be used in ways that fiat currency can't. "There are things that stablecoins maybe can do that your traditional cash can't," Dimon said, although he emphasized that the bank was looking to address client demand more than the bank's preferences. "It's what the customer wants," he said. "It's not what JP Morgan personally wants." Dimon's comments underscored his reservations about digital assets. Still, he expressed his belief in the potential usefulness of blockchain technology and his willingness to allow the banking giant to participate in the space. JP Morgan has introduced multiple cryptocurrency-focused initiatives in recent months. Earlier this week, JP Morgan announced a deal with America's largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, allowing customers to link their accounts to the platform and buy digital assets. Dimon has also recently praised stablecoins, a perspective he reiterated to CNBC. "I'm not against stablecoins," Dimon said. "I'm a believer in stablecoin, a believer in blockchain, not personally a believer in Bitcoin itself, but you're the customer—I don't like to tell customers what they can and can't do with their money." Stablecoins are digital tokens running on blockchains—like Ethereum or Solana—that are pegged to non-volatile assets, usually dollars. With a stable value, such cryptocurrencies were previously used by traders to enter and exit digital asset trades without the need for banks. But now, banks, major companies, including Meta and Amazon, and even U.S. states are all interested in issuing the tokens, which are supposed to accelerate payments leveraging blockchain technology. This month, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a framework for issuing and trading stablecoins in the U.S. JP Morgan's Coinbase deal means that Chase customers will be able to directly link bank accounts to their cryptocurrency wallets from next year. The bank also said it will "seamlessly and securely convert their points into cryptocurrencies." Publicly-traded Coinbase is the biggest exchange in the U.S. and allows users to buy, sell, and bet on the future price of digital coins and tokens. It also has a deal with the U.S. government to take custody of confiscated crypto. In the past, Dimon had been unsparing in his comments on Bitcoin, calling it a "pet rock" and valuable only to criminals. The bank has used blockchain technology in its products, though. NYSE-listed JP Morgan's stock was down by a little over 1% Thursday. Coinbase—which trades on the Nasdaq—was up marginally, by less than 1%.

Visa also said that clients using Visa's stablecoin services can accept the tokens via Avalanche and Stellar, too. Previously, Visa's stablecoin services were limited to blockchains Ethereum and Solana. Avalanche is a crypto network behind AVAX, the 22nd largest digital asset by market cap, and Stellar's native token, XLM, is the industry's 16th biggest crypto. AVAX was recently trading for $22.59, down more than 2.4% on the day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. XLM remained unchanged at $0.40. NYSE-listed Visa's stock, meanwhile, finished the day down by 1.5%, according to Google Finance data. "We believe that when stablecoins are trusted, scalable, and interoperable, they can fundamentally transform how money moves around the world," Visa's Global Head of Growth Products and Strategic Partnerships at Visa, Rubail Birwadker, said in a statement. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies typically pegged to stable assets such as the U.S. dollar to minimize price volatility. They were initially used primarily by traders to move funds without relying on traditional banks. But now, banks, major companies—including Meta and Amazon, reportedly—and even U.S. states are all interested in issuing stablecoins, which are supposed to accelerate payments using blockchain technology. Earlier this month, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, marking the first comprehensive federal framework for the issuance and regulation of stablecoins in the U.S. The legislation outlines requirements for issuers, sets standards for reserves and audits, and establishes clear rules for how stablecoins can be used and traded across financial markets. In 2021, Visa announced that it supported USD Coin on Ethereum. Since then, the company has introduced a number of other crypto-related ventures. In April, it partnered with Bridge, a unit of payment services provider Stripe, to offer stablecoin-linked debit cards in Latin American countries.

Title: Defense Spending Could Protect Your Investment Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/31/defense-spending-could-protect-your-investment-portfolio/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T22:48:42Z
Full Content:
BySteven Dudash BySteven Dudash, Contributor. The U.S. defense industry is emerging as one of the most resilient sectors for investors. Amid global instability and rising geopolitical tensions, American policymakers are displaying a unique commitment to military strength. The recent passage of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”, a sweeping piece of legislation that pushes U.S. defense spending to historic highs, and a newly agreed upon EU – U.S. trade deal underscores this trend. The bill adds $150 billion in new funding to the Department of Defense, bringing total projected spending for the 2026 fiscal year to over $1 trillion. On top of that, the EU has committed to over $600 billion of military equipment procurement in the coming years. The signal to markets is undeniable: defense is a national and global priority. For investors, this presents an opportunity. Massive new capital is now earmarked for shipbuilding, advanced munitions, next-generation aircraft, and a new missile defense system dubbed the “Golden Dome.” Defense stocks, long considered cyclical or defensive, may now be positioned for long-term structural growth. Interestingly, this surge in spending comes even as U.S. military expenditures, as a share of GDP, sit at multi-decade lows. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), global defense spending has climbed 37% over the past decade, but America’s share of that growth has not kept pace with its expanding economy. In short: U.S. defense spending is climbing fast in absolute terms, but relative to our economic size, there’s still plenty of runway ahead. Ongoing wars in Europe and the Middle East and intensifying tensions in the Indo-Pacific have forced governments across the globe to rethink their defense postures. In Europe, Russia’s continued aggression in Ukraine has led to a dramatic increase in defense budgets across NATO member states. The 2% GDP target for defense spending has given way to a 5%+ target for European members, meaning our allies are finally putting their money where their mouth is – although those expenditures are far from guaranteed. For context, in 2024, the U.S. spent roughly $3,000 per citizen on national defense, more than four times what most European nations spent, according to an article from Barron’s. In Europe that number needs to rise meaningfully if they’re going to hit their NATO commitments. The Middle East is increasingly unstable. U.S. involvement in ongoing conflicts in the region, including efforts to deter Iran’s nuclear program and manage the persistent tensions between Israel and Palestine, continues to highlight the need for advanced missile defense systems, precision munitions, and rapid deployment capabilities. The conflict also highlights the expenses associated with war. Every rocket fired comes with a price tag and restocking munitions is expensive, especially when a conflict is hot and countries can’t afford to wait for supplies. The conflict in the Middle East is also indirectly expensive in that it introduces significant volatility into global oil markets. Iran, as a key OPEC member, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, through which roughly 20% of the world’s petroleum supply passes. Any disruption here carries both economic and strategic consequences - further justifying elevated defense spending. Meanwhile, tensions in the Indo-Pacific region continue to build. China’s assertiveness around Taiwan and the South China Sea places it in direct competition with U.S. naval and diplomatic interests. The need to prepare for a potential conflict in the region has subtly been called to the forefront via Trump’s recent focus on shipbuilding and other maritime industries. U.S. naval power is extremely important if we were to see a real conflict develop here, but we need more ships. The U.S. market share in shipbuilding has plummeted to just 0.13% as of 2023, down from 5% in the 1970s, according to the U.S. Naval Institute. In contrast, China, Japan, and South Korea now account for over 90% of global shipbuilding capacity. As a result, the U.S. is more reliant on allies and commercial partnerships than ever before - a vulnerability that further underscores the need for investment. The international dimension of rising defense spending adds a powerful tailwind for U.S. contractors. In 2024, the U.S. Department of State reported that global arms transfers for the U.S. reached nearly $118 billion, and $97 billion of that was funded directly by U.S. allies and partners. American dominance in foreign military sales is accelerating, not just because of technological superiority, but because of interoperability. As Europe, the Middle East, and Asia expand their defense budgets, they are prioritizing systems that integrate seamlessly with U.S. platforms. Whether it’s the F-35 fighter jet or the Patriot missile system, American defense tech is becoming the global standard. This shift has economic implications as well. Defense remains one of the few areas where the U.S. still plays a leading role in high-value manufacturing, a strategic lever in our otherwise service-dominated economy. Arms exports give the U.S. a trade advantage, especially as reducing the trade deficit remains a priority for the Trump administration. The recently finalized EU-U.S. trade deal, which lowered blanket tariffs from 30% to 15%, also includes a pledge of $600 billion in EU military procurement. While the real flow of capital will depend on each country’s budget realities, demographics, and political might, the rhetoric alone has been enough to push European defense stocks lower. The market is betting the major U.S. defense contractors, commonly referred to as the primes, will ultimately be the benefactors. Between 2020 and 2024, the U.S. accounted for 43% of all global arms exports, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Key buyers include Saudi Arabia, Japan, Australia, and EU nations - many of which are now aiming for defense spending levels of 3–5% of GDP. For major U.S. firms like Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and RTX Corp. (RTX), this means multibillion-dollar order backlogs and increased income diversification. It also acts as a hedge against domestic budget volatility, reinforcing the fact that U.S. contractors don’t need to rely solely on Washington to grow. A growing portion of new defense dollars is being directed not just at traditional weaponry, but at artificial intelligence, autonomy, and next-generation battlefield technology. While tanks and missiles still matter, it’s AI, drones, and predictive analytics that will define the next phase of military dominance. Companies like Anduril Industries are at the forefront of this transformation. Their autonomous drone systems, battlefield command software, and AI surveillance tools are redefining how militaries perform in combat environments. The basis for all current and future R&D is that the U.S. military needs technology that is mass-producible and entirely replaceable. Unmanned and easily replaceable aircraft are a no-brainer for potential future conflicts. Meanwhile, Palantir Technologies (PLTR) continues to expand its work with the Department of Defense, building decision-intelligence platforms that help military leaders simulate outcomes and deploy resources more efficiently. These capabilities aren’t theoretical -they’re already being used in logistics, counterterrorism, and battlefield planning across several branches of the U.S. military. The software-first approach is here to stay. Beyond the battlefield, the digital domain is just as critical. Companies like Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) are playing crucial roles behind the scenes, working alongside defense contractors to secure U.S. military networks and infrastructure. Their platforms are already being used to detect foreign intrusions, prevent ransomware attacks, and build cyber resilience across key defense systems. As cyberattacks from nation-state actors continue to escalate, the Pentagon is steadily shifting a greater portion of its IT and cybersecurity budget toward these firms, viewing them as essential partners in modern warfare. Tanks, aircraft, and ships are worthless if you can’t secure the digital infrastructure required for operations. And then there’s SpaceX. Its Starlink satellite network has become essential for battlefield communications, notably in Ukraine, and its ability to launch defense communications into low-Earth orbit has made the company indispensable to Pentagon strategy. The militarization of space is no longer a sci-fi concept - it’s a live and growing budget category. Taken together, these companies represent a shift from defense as a manufacturing industry to one centered around software, autonomy, and connected systems. Investors looking to position themselves for the next decade of military innovation would be wise to watch not only the legacy names - but also the disruptors. Ultimately, investing in the defense sector isn’t just about capitalizing on geopolitical unrest - it’s about understanding the structural realignment of global priorities. Defense is a central pillar of economic, technological, and industrial strategy. New legislation in the U.S. and international military spending commitments signal a paradigm shift. Multiyear visibility into global defense spending is music to the ears of the legacy contractors. Rising players in autonomous systems, cybersecurity, and satellite communications are building out the next generation of military infrastructure. There’s lots to be excited about, and investors looking for durable tailwinds in a shifting global order should take a look across the entire defense spectrum.

Title: A 13% Dividends From AI? Here Are The Tickers

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. By now you’ve no doubt heard the argument that AI is a bubble, and there’s no way Big Tech will make a significant profit from it, given the massive amounts of cash they’ve already piled in. That take is just plain wrong—truth is, the tech giants are already booking profits from AI. And we closed-end fund (CEF) investors can grab our share at a discount—and at dividend rates running all the way up to 13%, too. This next chart tells us straight-up why the “AI-is-unprofitable” theory is off the mark. Look at the far left of this chart and you see that communication-services stocks led in profit growth in the second quarter of 2025. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) are both titans of that sector, and both have invested billions in AI. They’ve largely done it by buying chips and other hardware, as well as software, from IT firms like NVIDIA (NVDA). That pop in communication-services earnings proves that these companies are profiting from AI. Similarly, the second-highest earnings gains in the chart above, in IT, confirms that AI actually does make money for Big Tech. When it comes to high-yielding, tech-focused CEFs, there are basically four tickers that income investors look to. Let’s check in on those now. As you can see in the chart below, all four of these funds’ net asset values have been roaring higher, with the 12.3%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in green, leading by a small amount over the last three months. It’s followed closely by its sister fund, the 7.7%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple. The BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), with its huge 13% yield (in blue), and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK), (in orange and paying 6%) bring up the rear. The interesting thing, however, is the fact that these funds still trade at discounts to net asset value (NAV). The best values are the three BlackRock funds (again in green, blue and purple): We’ve seen BSTZ’s discount remain basically where it was three months ago, despite its strong NAV return in that time, while BST’s discount has widened slightly, despite its strong performance. The third BlackRock tech CEF, the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), has seen its discount narrow slightly (April was a great time to buy BTX). The Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is the priciest of our quartet, but context matters here, as its premium to NAV, which it has held for much of the last decade, suddenly disappeared. Let’s stick with STK for a bit. Despite that fund’s smaller discount, is it still worth our time? I’d say yes, given the next chart. But there is a caveat that we’ll get into shortly. Before we get to that, we see that STK, whose NAV (in purple above) has closely matched the NASDAQ 100 (whose benchmark index fund is shown in orange) over the last decade. That makes STK a good way to get tech exposure, plus the index’s diversification. I mention that diversification because STK is tech-heavy, with core names like Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA and Apple (AAPL). But like the NASDAQ, it also branches out a bit, with holdings in companies like Visa (V) and Bloom Energy (BE), which focuses on products that help customers generate power on-site. On the dividend side, STK’s 6% yield far outruns the NASDAQ’s 0.5%, and the CEF has also never cut its payouts. However, STK is contending with funds yielding a lot more—up to 13% in the case of the highest-paying BlackRock fund, BTX. That’s the real reason for STK’s growing discount: Even though it was swept up in the tech rally, its lower payouts aren’t enough for many income investors, now that there’s more competition, plus dividends that nearly double STK’s 6% yield, among tech CEFs. This is why the bigger discounts offered by the BlackRock funds are the better deals here, and why STK’s discount isn’t yet big enough to warrant our attention.

Title: Coinbase Stock Slides After Q2 Sales Miss Estimates

Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) slid late Thursday after the crypto exchange reported second-quarter earnings that missed analyst estimates. Coinbase reported revenue of $1.49 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $512 million. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha anticipated $1.56 billion in revenue and adjusted EBITDA of about $564 million. Revenue from transactions as well as subscriptions and services were down quarter-over-quarter, though the latter, at $656 million, was within the range Coinbase previously forecast at $600 million to $680 million. The stock was recently down about 4% in late trading after finishing the regular session essentially unchanged. Lower trading volume dragged on transaction revenue, as it did in the first. A March increase in stablecoin pair trade fees weighed on trading volume, a company representative told Investopedia. However, Coinbase sees July transaction revenue of roughly $360 million; if that pace keeps up through the next couple months, third-quarter results should be better. The company also expects subscriptions and services to rise, driven primarily by higher average crypto prices and stablecoin revenue. Its partnership with Circle should help with stablecoin USDC usage ticking up. Coinbase has been pulling on growth levers all year, making acquisitions and inking partnership deals with big firms in the financial industry. It acquired crypto options exchange Deribit in May, and earlier this month acquired token management shop Liquifi. It partnered with American Express (AXP) for a bitcoin-rewards credit card in June. And recently, it joined forces with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to offer customers another way to link their bank accounts to the exchange. Coinbase shares are up nearly 50% year-to-date. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect added information and new share-price movement.

Amazon (AMZN) shares tumbled in extended trading Thursday, despite better-than-projected earnings and growth in its Amazon Web Services. Investors may have been looking for more in the wake of Microsoft's blowout results. Amazon posted second-quarter revenue of $167.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. The e-commerce and cloud services giant's net income of $18.2 billion, or $1.68 per share, compared to $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier, topping Wall Street’s estimates. Online store sales grew 11% to $61.49 billion, while revenue from Amazon Web Services revenue increased 18% to $30.9 billion, also above projections. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead," CEO Andy Jassy said. However, investors may have wanted more from the cloud services giant after strong results from Microsoft's Azure yesterday. Jefferies analysts said in a note Thursday that AWS growth was "disappointing given big momentum at Azure and GCP." Looking ahead, Amazon forecast third-quarter revenue of $174 billion to $179.5 billion, above the $173.17 billion analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha called for. Its outlook for operating income between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion was slightly ahead of the analyst consensus at the midpoint. Shares of Amazon dropped over 7% in after-hours trading. The stock was up 7% for 2025 through Thursday's close. This article has been updated since it was first published to include additional information and reflect more recent share price values.

Business FILE PHOTO: U.S. dollar banknotes are seen in this illustration taken May 4, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo NEW YORK/LONDON :The U.S. dollar index rose on Thursday while MSCI's global equities gauge fell as stronger-than-expected megacap earnings reports were balanced against signs of rising inflation and investor anxiousness ahead of President Donald Trump's deadline for trade agreements. Trump gave Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs to negotiate a broader trade deal but was expected to issue higher final duty rates for most other countries as the clock wound down on the Friday deadline. Earlier in the day, an economic data release showed U.S. inflation increased in June as tariffs on imports started raising the cost of some goods, supporting economists' expectations that price pressures would pick up in the second half of the year. Thursday's data also showed fewer-than-expected Americans applied for unemployment benefits, while second-quarter U.S. labor costs increased slightly more than expected on a pick-up in wage growth.

Loading The Federal Reserve kept rates steady on Wednesday, and Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed to wait for more data before deciding whether to adjust rates in September, sending equities lower on the day and drawing further criticism from Trump.Indexes saw some support earlier on Thursday from better-than-expected results from Microsoft and Meta Platforms but by the end of the day, gains had evaporated. With the economic data appearing to support the Fed's more hawkish stance and an anxious wait for Friday's payroll report along with Trump's tariff deadline, investors had an awful lot to handle this week, said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Schwab. "This is one of those weeks where it's almost too much information to digest, so the market is ignoring it all and staying in a tight range," Gordon said. However, he noted megacap strength was countering weakness elsewhere in the market including in small-cap companies, which have less latitude to cope with higher prices."You really only have communications services and parts of technology that are holding you up today. Breadth is generally pretty weak," the strategist said.

European investors were disappointed by corporate earnings reports from the likes of Sanofi and Ferrari, while beverage makers slid as they were faced with a 15 per cent U.S. tariff. US DOLLAR EYES MONTHLY GAINIn currencies, the U.S. dollar was eyeing its first monthly gain for 2025 against major currencies, underpinned by hopes for clarity on trade policy and U.S. economic resilience.For the day, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.26 per cent to 100.05.The euro was up 0.08 per cent at $1.1413 and the Mexican peso strengthened 0.23 per cent versus the dollar at 18.854. But against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.84 per cent to 150.76 after the Bank of Japan held interest rates steady and increased its inflation forecast.The Korean won weakened 0.21 per cent against the dollar after Trump's announcement that the U.S. would charge a 15 per cent tariff on imports from South Korea, which would in return invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products. In U.S. Treasuries, longer-dated yields were lower before the anticipated July jobs report, reversing an increase on Wednesday following Powell's comment.The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 0.6 basis points to 4.372 per cent, from 4.378 per cent late on Wednesday, while the 30-year bond yield fell 1.5 basis points to 4.8979 per cent.But the 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Federal Reserve, rose 2 basis points to 3.957 per cent, from 3.937 per cent late on Wednesday.In oil markets, prices fell 1 per cent after rising in each of the prior three sessions as investors considered the extension of an existing trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico and a surprise build in U.S. crude stocks put pressure on prices.U.S. crude settled down 1.06 per cent, or 74 cents at $69.26 a barrel while Brent settled at $72.53 per barrel, down 0.97 per cent, or 71 cents on the day.Gold prices rose as traders turned to the safe-haven asset on tariff uncertainty.

Title: Microsoft reaches $4 trillion market cap, three weeks after Nvidia

A few weeks ago, Nvidia became the first company in the world to reach the coveted $4 trillion market capitalization. This was on the back of a strong quarter where it raked in $44.1 billion, fueled by the strong demand for its AI-optimized hardware. Now, Microsoft has a similar story to tell following its latest fiscal quarter reports from yesterday. After informing investors and the public that it earned $76.4 billion in FY25 Q4, resulting in a net income of an eye-watering $27.2 billion, Microsoft's stock price has jumped by roughly 5%, which means that it has crossed the $4 trillion market cap. It is only the second company to reach this mark as others are quite a ways off. Apple stands strong at $3.1 trillion, Google's parent company Alphabet is at $2.3 trillion, and Meta is about to hit the $2 trillion-mark. It's not entirely surprising that Microsoft managed to reach this market cap so soon after its latest fiscal report. The company's reason for soaring market value is the same as Nvidia: AI and the cloud. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella credited the firm's investments in the cloud and AI, also noting that Azure passed $75 billion in annual revenue. Other categories like Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing grew too. Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood also had the following to say: We closed out the fiscal year with a strong quarter, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud revenue reaching $46.7 billion, up 27% (up 25% in constant currency) year-over-year. While Microsoft celebrates reaching this milestone, it is also worth highlighting that the company recently laid off 9,000 employees despite enjoying a particularly strong quarter. Satya Nadella noted shortly after that the decision weighs heavily on him, but unfortunately, this is the "enigma of success". Whatever that means.

Aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce surged 8.5 per cent to 1,072p after the company boosted profit predictions on the back of strong results for the first half of the year. The company said operations could generate up to £3.2 billion profit this year, £300 million more than it originally forecast. The news continued a turnaround for the company, which makes engines for Airbus wide-body jets and luxury cars, since Tufan Erginbilgic joined as chief executive in 2023 Oil giant Shell advanced 1.19 per cent to 2,711p after announcing plans for a share buy-back programme.

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors digested a wave of corporate earnings reports and economic data. The market is now looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s policy statement expected on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.46%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined 0.30% and 0.38%, respectively. Shares of UnitedHealth dropped after the company forecasted annual profits below expectations. This impacted the broader healthcare sector. Whirlpool also experienced a significant decline, plunging after missing second-quarter earnings estimates and trimming its full-year profit outlook. UPS was another notable laggard, contributing to the decline in the Dow Transports index. In contrast, VF Corp experienced a surge in its stock price, rising about 13% in premarket trading. The company beat first-quarter revenue estimates, attributing this to increased demand for its apparel and footwear products. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange reacted to the mixed bag of earnings reports. They are bracing for further guidance from the Federal Reserve. The Fed kicked off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday alongside a busy slate of economic data. While the Fed is expected to hold rates steady, investors remain on edge for any signs of economic weakness that could justify cuts later this year. Job openings and hirings both fell in June, setting the stage for the all-important monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday. Meanwhile, consumer confidence saw an uptick in July, but worries about job availability intensified, according to official figures. Big Tech earnings are in full swing this week, with Meta and Microsoft set to report after the bell on Wednesday. Apple and Amazon are due on Thursday. According to Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy Venu Krishna, Big Tech has been the lone major market cohort this year that’s had earnings growth outperform its actual price return. Krishna argues this supports Big Tech’s lofty valuations and is a key reason to remain bullish on the sector. Investors remain cautious as they await more corporate earnings reports and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision. The stock market’s trajectory will likely be influenced by these factors in the coming days.

ByTy Roush ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg overtook Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to become the world’s third-wealthiest person Thursday, as Meta’s stock surged in the wake of yet another earnings beat for the firm. Zuckerberg’s net worth jumped nearly 12% to $268.4 billion Thursday, an increase of about $28.4 billion, as Meta’s share price rallied more than 11%, pacing what would be the stock’s second-largest increase on the year. Zuckerberg, who holds a 13% stake in Meta, surpassed Amazon chairman Bezos ($247.4 billion) to become the third-richest person in the world, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list, even as about $4.5 billion was added to Bezos’ net worth as Amazon shares jumped nearly 2%. Elon Musk remains the world’s richest person by far with a fortune valued at $403.5 billion as of Thursday, followed by Oracle chairman Larry Ellison ($306 billion) in second. 40%. That’s how much Meta’s share price has increased since falling to its lowest point this year in April. A surge in Meta’s share price and Zuckerberg’s fortune comes a day after the company reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that came well above projections. Meta reported $47.5 billion in revenue and $7.14 earnings per share, an annual increase of 22% and 38%, respectively, as the firm reported its 10th-straight quarter with a profit beat and its 12th straight for topping revenue estimates. Many investors focused on the company’s increased spending on artificial intelligence in recent months, as Meta announced an uptick in capital expenditures while it "aggressively [pursues] opportunities” related to its “artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.” Microsoft on Thursday became the second company to reach a market valuation of $4 trillion, joining Nvidia, as shares rose about 4%. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who holds a roughly 3% stake in the company, added about $4.9 billion to his net worth ($149 billion) during the company’s latest rally. Ballmer is the eighth-richest person in the world, according to our latest estimates, directly behind Google’s Sergey Brin ($151.5 billion) and right ahead of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault ($142.9 billion).

Title: Pam Bondi: Who is Trump’s attorney general handling the Epstein files?

The former Florida top cop has embraced loyalty to Trump, but faces fallout from the MAGA base over Epstein files. United States Attorney General Pam Bondi has emerged as one of the most embattled top officials in the administration of United States President Donald Trump, amid fallout over her handling of disclosures related to the sex trafficking case of billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has so far stood by Bondi, who has been instrumental in his reshaping of the Department of Justice, but the president has continued to voice frustration that public fixation on the scandal – and criticism from both within his base and among his opponents – has refused to die down. Democrats have adopted the issue as their latest political cudgel, while Republicans in Congress have promised to continue their own probe when they return from summer recess, with plans to hear testimony from Bondi, as well as subpoena the case files and testimony from Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell. Two lawmakers are even pushing a bill that would compel Bondi to release the documents in question, a move Republican Thomas Massie has said is aimed at “justice for the victims and transparency for Americans”. So who is Bondi and how did the 59-year-old attorney general come to be one of Trump’s most loyal cabinet members? Bondi spent 18 years as a public prosecutor in Hillsborough County, Florida before breaking into statewide office. The lengthy career gave her more direct prosecutorial experience than any preceding US attorney general, according to the Heritage Foundation, the conservative group that has had an outsized role in shaping the policy of Trump’s second term. Speaking last year to the Tampa Bay Times, former colleagues recounted Bondi’s reputation for jury-turning charisma that saw her quickly rise through the ranks of felony prosecutions. But it was regular media appearances as a legal analyst on national news networks that helped her to build public recognition, which was credited with her victory in Florida’s open attorney general race in 2010. Bondi, who took office in 2011, was also buoyed by the endorsement of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. As attorney general, Bondi led crusades against so-called “pill mills”, clinics that loosely prescribe pain medications, while leading some Republican pet causes, including a multi-state effort to overturn former President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act. She also led efforts to uphold Florida’s ban on same sex marriage, before its nationwide legalisation by Supreme Court order in 2015, as well as the ability for same sex couples to adopt. During that period, Bondi sought to establish herself as a champion against sex trafficking and child sex abuse, launching the state’s council on human trafficking and an investigation into past abuse by Catholic priests. As Florida’s top cop, she also had her first brush with Epstein, with critics accusing her of remaining willfully silent on a controversial non-prosecution agreement Epstein and his co-conspirators had struck with her predecessor. They have said Bondi could have intervened as victims launched lawsuits challenging the deal, which saw Epstein plead guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution but serve only months in prison. “But Bondi kept her distance from the state’s most prominent sex-trafficking case, even as Epstein’s victims pleaded with the courts to invalidate provisions of his non-prosecution agreement and filed lawsuits alleging he abused them when he was on work release from jail,” wrote Mary Ellen Klas, a Bloomberg opinion writer and former Miami Herald Bureau Chief. “Her inaction helped to perpetuate what victims describe as a government cover-up that, along with Epstein’s death, has robbed those victims of their chance to get answers and hold their abusers to account,” she wrote. Bondi’s connections with Trump drew scrutiny even before he entered office, after it was revealed in 2016 that authorities had launched an ethics probe related to the soon-to-be president. At question was whether Bondi had solicited contributions from Trump in 2013, as her office was weighing joining a lawsuit against Trump University. Her office denied any wrongdoing, and the investigation was later dropped. Despite those early contacts, Bondi was not an early adherent to Trump’s presidential ambitions or his nascent “Make America Great Again” movement. Instead, she initially supported former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the 2016 Republican primary. When Jeb dropped out of the race, she threw her lot in with Trump. From there, things accelerated quickly. While still Florida’s attorney general, Bondi served on Trump’s first White House transition team. She left her post in Florida in 2019 and soon joined the Ballard Lobbyist group, representing the interests of Amazon, General Motors, and Uber, among others. From there, she joined the White House legal team, defending the president during his first impeachment trial in the US Senate, in which Trump was accused of conditioning weapons to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on then political opponent Biden. After Trump’s election loss, Bondi was among those spearheading unfounded claims that the vote was marred by widespread fraud. She helped coordinate former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s infamous news conference at the Four Seasons Landscaping in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she flatly and falsely claimed that Trump had “won Pennsylvania”. She went on to chair the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), a pro-Trump think tank that oversaw “a series of concerning lawsuits in recent years, particularly in the voting rights and elections arena”, as described by the Brennan Center for Justice. Publicly, she also floated prosecuting career federal law enforcement officials who investigated Trump. In criticising her appointment, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee in January said that Bondi had “the ultimate qualification” to be Trump’s attorney general: “loyalty”. That loyalty has generated much consternation since Bondi took office, with opponents accusing her of shaping the country’s top law enforcement agency in Trump’s likeness. That has included hundreds of layoffs at the department, including investigators and prosecutors in the two federal criminal cases lodged against Trump before his November election victory last year. She has also launched a task force to probe those investigations, while publicly decrying what she has framed as a conspiracy against Trump amid the career staff, saying the staff of the FBI and Justice Department were rife with employees “who despise Donald Trump, despise us”, as she told Fox News. More recently, she launched a strike force to investigate how the intelligence community, under former President Obama, handled information related to Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election, in what some have seen as an attempt to distract from the Epstein imbroglio. She has also announced a misconduct complaint against federal Judge James Boasberg, escalating a standoff over judges who have ruled against Trump’s early actions, most notably his use of the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members with little requirement for proof. But it was Bondi’s embrace of theories pushed by Trump’s staunchest supporters that has landed her in the current predicament. In February, she brazenly told Fox News that she had Epstein’s long-sought “client list” – thought to contain the names of the powerful figures the billionaire blackmailed via his sex scheme – “sitting on my desk right now”. Months later, the White House would say Bondi was referring to the entirety of Epstein’s case files, and not specifically the list long sought by MAGA’s most influential voices. That came shortly after the Justice Department in July released a memo, stating flatly: “This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list'”. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out

Another day, another vague reference to the promise of superintelligence. On Wednesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a video address and accompanying letter on X stating his company's "vision for the future of personal superintelligence for everyone." Also: How Meta's new AI chatbot could strike up a conversation with you Zuckerberg coined that term -- without actually defining it -- earlier this month, when Meta announced its new Superintelligence Labs, a division within the company dedicated to building a computer system that significantly surpasses human capability. Superintelligence would leapfrog artificial general intelligence (AGI), which would be theoretically comparable to the human brain. Both remain deeply hypothetical. Also: Is AI overhyped or underhyped? 6 tips to separate fact from fiction In the letter, Zuckerberg references recent advancements in agentic AI, noting that systems are slowly but surely "improving themselves," and claims that superintelligence is more possible than ever -- something we've heard before. Still, for every advancement, there is usually a limitation. "As profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be," writes Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg's message refrains from clarifying what a personal AI product or service could be. Regardless, he is optimistic it will free the industry from the automation trap. "If trends continue, then you'd expect people to spend less time in productivity software, and more time creating and connecting," he says. It's unclear whether that trend has actually begun, though, considering how Jevon's Paradox -- the theory that efficiency only begets more consumption, not freedom -- appears to be playing out. Also: I've worn the Meta Ray-Bans for half a year, and these 5 features still amaze me "Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful," his letter continues. "Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices." The Information reported on Monday that Meta's smart glasses sales have more than tripled in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Perhaps for good reason; ZDNET senior AI editor Sabrina Ortiz recently noted in our AI newsletter that smart glasses are, in her opinion, the most successful vehicle for effective personal AI. Amidst the optimism, Zuckerberg noted the already-present reality that AI will disrupt many parts of society, including the job market -- and that how we'll apply superintelligence remains to be seen (if or when it is realized). "The rest of this decade seems likely to be the decisive period for determining the path this technology will take, and whether superintelligence will be a tool for personal empowerment or a force focused on replacing large swaths of society," he writes. Also: Open-source skills can save your career when AI comes knocking Zuckerberg's vision expands on the current argument for why AI agents are useful. At their most efficient, agents take up the busywork that can claim much of a human worker's day, automating the mundane so employees can focus on higher-level, more singular contributions. That's precisely because agents are broadly less capable than humans, especially when it comes to tasks like original creative work, relationship management, negotiation, and understanding certain contexts. But the whole premise of superintelligence is that it would far exceed what the human brain can do. How Zuckerberg maintains this is possible while also assuring it would not displace people themselves will remain logically opaque until we have concrete examples. Also: 5 entry-level tech jobs AI is already augmenting, according to Amazon This feels especially relevant in the context of work, where AI's agentic impact is unsettling job security. Microsoft just completed a third round of layoffs this year, ostensibly thanks to AI, and policy has yet to specify worker protections for those at risk of being replaced by the technology, instead favoring tax breaks for upskilling initiatives. Meta itself is in the process of laying off 5% of its workforce this year, following 21,000 total layoffs since 2022, according to Business Insider. As is the case at other companies, the layoffs are at least partially due to redirecting funds into AI development. It's unclear whether these roles at Meta will eventually also be replaced by AI. In what could be seen as a strategic investment plea, Zuckerberg assured the public that, despite offering no specifics, Meta can be trusted with the huge responsibility of shepherding whatever "personal superintelligence" is toward humanity's best interests -- unlike other AI companies. "We believe in putting this power in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives," his letter says, noting that Meta is "distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output." "At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture," he says. Also: Control your computer with your mind? Meta's working on that It's unclear how this approach to a still-unrealized power will fit with the company's past business decisions. In April, for example, Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams, formerly the company's director of global policy, testified that Meta shared data with advertisers about when users, including teens, felt most "worthless or helpless." While double-speak isn't surprising coming from the world's most powerful CEOs, Zuckerberg's message is a worthwhile reminder that, in their relatively brief history, tech companies have yet to commit their technology to the betterment of the human condition over profits. In carefully promising nothing but asking for the public's trust, the message leaves uncertain who Zuckerberg's idealized future is particularly for -- especially in an increasingly deregulated policy environment. Also: Trump's AI plan pushes AI upskilling instead of worker protections - and 4 other key takeaways In the meantime, the AI agents we have today support tasks like studying and exam prep, coding, turning notes into video, perfecting images, and more.

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. As companies like Amazon publicly announce AI-driven workforce reductions, workers are scrambling to understand which careers might soon disappear and be outsourced to technology. A new report from Microsoft researchers studying the occupational implications of generative AI offers some clarity. Translators, historians, and writers are among the roles with the highest AI applicability score, meaning the job’s tasks are most closely aligned with AI’s current abilities, according to the report released this month that ranked professions. Customer service and sales representatives—which make up about 5 million jobs in the U.S.—will also have to compete with AI. Overall, the jobs most exposed are ones that involve knowledge work—like people doing computer, math, or administrative work in an office, the researchers wrote. Sales jobs are also high on the list, since they often involve sharing and explaining information. While Microsoft said high applicability doesn’t automatically mean those jobs will necessarily be replaced by AI, the list of roles quickly went viral—with professionals deeming them “most at risk.” It comes as companies like IBM have been freezing thousands of would-be new roles that it expects AI will take over in the next 5 years, and graduates in the U.K. are facing the worst job market since 2018 as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs, says Indeed. Of course, there are some jobs that are unlikely to be touched by AI: Dredge operators; bridge and lock tenders; and water treatment plant and system operators are among the jobs with virtually no generative AI exposure, thanks in part to their hands-on equipment requirements. Still, business leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have said that every job will be touched by AI in some way, and so it’s best to embrace it. “Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable,” Huang said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in May. “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.” Many of the jobs with high chances of getting upended by AI soon, like political scientists, journalists, and management analysts, are all ones that typically require a four-year degree to land a job. And as the researchers point out, having a degree—which was once considered a surefire path to career advancement—is no longer a safeguard against the changing tides. “In terms of education requirements, we find higher AI applicability for occupations requiring a Bachelor’s degree than occupations with lower requirements,” wrote the researchers, who studied 200,000 real-world conversations of Copilot users and cross-compared the AI’s performance with occupational data.

Title: Microsoft researchers have revealed the list of the 40 jobs that AI is likely to steal—and not even teachers are safe

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. As companies like Amazon publicly announce AI-driven workforce reductions, workers are scrambling to understand which careers might soon disappear and be outsourced to technology. A new report from Microsoft researchers studying the occupational implications of generative AI offers some clarity. Translators, historians, and writers are among the roles with the highest AI applicability score, meaning the job’s tasks are most closely aligned with AI’s current abilities, according to the report released this month that ranked professions. Customer service and sales representatives—which make up about 5 million jobs in the U.S.—will also have to compete with AI. Overall, the jobs most exposed are ones that involve knowledge work—like people doing computer, math, or administrative work in an office, the researchers wrote. Sales jobs are also high on the list, since they often involve sharing and explaining information. While Microsoft said high applicability doesn’t automatically mean those jobs will necessarily be replaced by AI, the list of roles quickly went viral—with professionals deeming them “most at risk.” It comes as companies like IBM have been freezing thousands of would-be new roles that it expects AI will take over in the next 5 years, and graduates in the U.K. are facing the worst job market since 2018 as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs, says Indeed. Of course, there are some jobs that are unlikely to be touched by AI: Dredge operators; bridge and lock tenders; and water treatment plant and system operators are among the jobs with virtually no generative AI exposure, thanks in part to their hands-on equipment requirements. Still, business leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have said that every job will be touched by AI in some way, and so it’s best to embrace it. “Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable,” Huang said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in May. “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.” Many of the jobs with high chances of getting upended by AI soon, like political scientists, journalists, and management analysts, are all ones that typically require a four-year degree to land a job. And as the researchers point out, having a degree—which was once considered a surefire path to career advancement—is no longer a safeguard against the changing tides. “In terms of education requirements, we find higher AI applicability for occupations requiring a Bachelor’s degree than occupations with lower requirements,” wrote the researchers, who studied 200,000 real-world conversations of Copilot users and cross-compared the AI’s performance with occupational data. On the flip side, there are some career paths with low AI exposure, that are growing in demand. The healthcare sector, in particular, is an area that is experiencing this heavily. The home health and personal care aid industry is expected to create the greatest number of new jobs over the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor.

Full Content:
July 31, 2025 10:58 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, July 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Less Lethal Ammunition Global Market Report 2025" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The less lethal ammunition market size has grown steadily in recent years. It will grow from $1.06 billion in 2024 to $1.11 billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.3%. The growth in the historic period can be attributed to civil rights movements and protests, law enforcement requirements, tactical and military operations, public pressure and advocacy, awareness of human rights.The less lethal ammunition market size is expected to see strong growth in the next few years. It will grow to $1.36 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to global security concerns, urbanization and population growth, ethical and humanitarian considerations, risk mitigation strategies, international conflict resolution efforts. Major trends in the forecast period include training integration and simulation, humanitarian and peacekeeping applications, innovative safety features, enhanced effectiveness and accuracy.The forecast of 5.3% growth over the next five years indicates a slight reduction of 0.1% from the previous projection for this market. This marginal decrease is influenced by ongoing tariff-related uncertainties between the U.S. and its trade partners. This is likely to directly affect the US through tariffs on rubber bullet manufacturing equipment from Brazil and Spain, increasing costs for law enforcement agencies. The effect will also be felt more widely due to reciprocal tariffs and the negative effect on the global economy and trade due to increased trade tensions and restrictions.The rise in crime rates is anticipated to drive the growth of the less lethal ammunition market in the future. Crime encompasses unlawful activities or behaviors that are prohibited by law and subject to legal penalties, representing any actions against the established rules and regulations of a particular jurisdiction. The escalating crime rates necessitate the use of less lethal ammunition by law enforcement, offering a non-lethal option to manage and subdue potential threats while minimizing the risk of fatal injuries. For instance, in October 2023, a report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a U.S.-based law enforcement agency, indicated that in 2022, there was an estimated 1.3% increase in robbery incidents nationwide compared to the previous year. Thus, the rising incidence of crime is propelling the growth of the less lethal ammunition market moving forward.The less lethal ammunition market is experiencing growth, driven by the augmented budget allocation for the military and law enforcement sectors. Budget allocation for these sectors involves the government earmarking financial resources to fund operations, activities, and equipment. This allocation supports the expansion of less-lethal ammunition, enabling the development and deployment of advanced technologies to enhance the capabilities of security forces and address concerns related to lethal force.Training and simulation solutions have emerged as a pivotal trend in the less-lethal ammunition market, with major companies actively developing innovative products to solidify their market positions. In February 2022, RUAG Ammotec's Defense and Law Enforcement business unit (DLE), a part of the Swiss technology company RUAG Group, introduced lead-free 9x19 LF Training SX ammunition. This new product, weighing 6.1 g and 94 g, addresses the increased demand from police departments for lead-free, low-pollutant ammunition. Notably, the cartridge maintains the same point of impact and equivalent recoil as the traditional ACTION 4 cartridge due to a precisely regulated charging procedure. The introduction of training and simulation solutions in the form of lead-free ammunition exemplifies a key trend driving the less-lethal ammunition market's growth.Less lethal ammunition comprises specialized projectiles or rounds primarily designed for use by law enforcement, military, and security personnel. It serves the purpose of incapacitating or subduing individuals without causing fatal injuries, providing an intermediate level of force between verbal commands and the use of lethal firearms.The primary types of less lethal ammunition include rubber bullets, bean bag rounds, plastic bullets, and paintballs. Rubber bullets, for instance, are non-lethal ammunition specifically crafted for use in crowd control and riot situations by law enforcement or military personnel. They are intended to disperse or incapacitate individuals without causing fatal harm. Rubber bullets are compatible with various weapon types, including shotguns and launchers, and find applications in military and law enforcement scenarios.Note that the outlook for this market is being affected by rapid changes in trade relations and tariffs globally. The report will be updated prior to delivery to reflect the latest status, including revised forecasts and quantified impact analysis. The report's Recommendations and Conclusions sections will be updated to give strategies for entities dealing with the fast-moving international environment.Major players in the less-lethal ammunition market are directing their efforts towards developing innovative products, including less-lethal shotgun ammunition. Less-lethal shotgun ammunition is designed to incapacitate or deter threats without causing fatal injuries. In September 2023, Byrna Technologies, a US-based defense products manufacturer, launched Byrna LE. This handheld gun features patented pull-pierce technology and an increased shot capacity, offering a more powerful alternative. Accompanying the launcher is a fin-tailed 12-gauge shotgun shell, providing enhanced self-defense options that enable users to switch between less-lethal and standard rounds. Byrna Technologies aims to reduce gun-related casualties by promoting the use of these alternatives, citing real-world successes in preventing carjackings, thwarting muggings, and deterring home invasions. The focus on innovative shotgun products stands out as a strategy to increase profitability in the less-lethal ammunition market.North America was the largest region in the less lethal ammunition market in 2024. The regions covered in the less lethal ammunition market report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East, Africa. The countries covered in the less lethal ammunition market report are Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, UK, USA, Italy, Spain, Canada.Key Topics Covered: 1.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Only two companies have ever reached that size. By Eddie Makuch on July 31, 2025 at 7:52AM PDT Microsoft achieved a $4 trillion market cap, becoming just the second company ever to reach that valuation. Microsoft is now the No. 2 most valuable company on the planet, trailing only Nvidia. The climbing valuation comes just after Microsoft laid off 9,000+ people, including major cuts at Xbox. Microsoft reported earnings on Wednesday, and the company beat expectations. The company's stock price jumped after that, helping push Microsoft's total valuation above $4 trillion. The stock price has since cooled off, dropping Microsoft back below $4 trillion but still ranking No. 2 overall. Microsoft is currently trading at around $538 per share, which is up 28% year-to-date and up 163% over the past five years. The top five companies on the planet ranked by market cap include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet, in that order. Microsoft brought in revenue of $76.4 billion for the quarter that ended June 30, along with a profit of $27.2 billion. For the Xbox business, Microsoft reported that annual Game Pass revenue reached nearly $5 billion for the first time, with 50 million people trying Black Ops 6. Additionally, Microsoft said Xbox had 500 million monthly active users across all platforms, covering console, PC, mobile, and more. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on an earnings call that Microsoft is the "top publisher" on both Xbox and PlayStation. Newly published US video game sales data showed that Xbox games are dominating the PlayStation sales charts. Looking ahead, Microsoft plans to invest even more in AI infrastructure and technology than before, with Microsoft upping its planned investment from $80 billion to $120 billion. Nadella acknowledged in a memo to staff that people may wonder why Microsoft is laying off thousands of people as its business thrives. He said, "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value." For Xbox, Microsoft's cuts included not only layoffs but game cancellations and the closure of at least one studio. See the gallery below to learn more about the extent of the cuts.

Full Content:
The $4 trillion club is now a party of two. Microsoft (MSFT) on Thursday became the second company in history to reach a $4 trillion market value as tech stock prices continued to climb on booming AI demand. Microsoft's stock popped 7% at the open, putting its market capitalization at $4.09 trillion, after the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter results blew past expectations on strong growth in all of its businesses, but especially in its cloud computing and AI services. Microsoft’s entry into the $4 trillion club comes just weeks after Nvidia (NVDA) became the first company to reach the milestone. Its market cap briefly crossed $4 trillion in intraday trading on July 9, but it wasn’t until July 10 that it closed above the threshold. Microsoft was already America’s second most valuable company, worth nearly $2 trillion, when the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked an AI frenzy in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street. But surging demand for AI and cloud computing has turbocharged Microsoft’s growth in the last three years. The company on Wednesday reported 2025 fiscal-year revenue of close to $282 billion, up from $198 billion in the fiscal year before ChatGPT, and net income of $102 billion, up from $73 billion. With about 7.4 billion shares outstanding, Microsoft stock will need to close at or above $538.13 to stay in the $4 trillion club. Shares were up 5% just above $539 in recent trading.

Title: Is There More Upside For MSFT Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered a strong Q4 performance, surpassing consensus estimates for earnings, sales, and its future outlook. This positive news has sent the stock up 8% in pre-market trading, extending its impressive rally of over 50% since its April low of around $350. Despite this significant climb, we believe there’s still considerable upside potential. While Microsoft's current valuation is high, we see minimal cause for concern, making it an attractive investment. Our optimistic view stems from a comprehensive analysis comparing MSFT's current valuation to its recent operating performance and its historical and current financial health. We've assessed Microsoft across key parameters: Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience. This analysis reveals Microsoft's exceptionally strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – META Stock To $1,500? Microsoft has demonstrated notable revenue growth in recent years, outperforming the S&P 500. Over the last three years, its top line has grown at an average rate of 12.5%, compared to 5.3% for the S&P 500. In the most recent twelve-month period, revenues increased by 14.9% from $245 billion to $282 billion, while the S&P 500 saw 4.4% growth. Quarterly revenues in the most recent period grew 18% to $76.4 billion from $65 billion a year ago, against a 4.5% improvement for the S&P 500. This consistent, strong revenue expansion supports the company's robust market position. Microsoft exhibits exceptionally high profit margins, considerably exceeding most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Its operating income over the last four quarters was $129 billion, translating to a substantial operating margin of 45.6%, in contrast to 18.3% for the S&P 500. The company’s operating cash flow (OCF) for the same period was $136 billion, indicating a very high OCF margin of 48.3% compared to 19.8% for the S&P 500. Furthermore, Microsoft’s net income of $102 billion over the last four quarters yielded a considerable net income margin of 36.1%, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s 11.8%. These strong profitability metrics underscore Microsoft's efficient operations and effective cost management. Microsoft’s balance sheet is characterized by very strong financial stability. As of the most recent quarter, its debt stood at $61 billion, with a market capitalization of close to $4 trillion. This translates to a very strong debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5%, which is substantially lower than the S&P 500’s 23.4%. The company also maintains a healthy cash position, with cash (including cash equivalents) making up $95 billion of its $619 billion in total assets, resulting in a strong cash-to-assets ratio of 15.3% compared to 6.7% for the S&P 500. These figures highlight Microsoft's robust financial health and its ability to manage its liabilities effectively. Microsoft stock has generally shown slightly better resilience than the broader markets during recent economic downturns. During the Inflation Shock of 2022, MSFT fell 37.6% but fully recovered by June 15, 2023. In the Covid Pandemic of 2020, MSFT saw a 28.2% decline from its peak, recovering fully by June 9, 2020, outperforming the S&P 500’s 33.9% drop. Look at Buy or Sell MSFT stock for more details. Overall, Microsoft demonstrates very strong performance across growth, profitability, and financial stability, with its downturn resilience being neutral. This comprehensive analysis points to an overall very strong outlook for MSFT stock. Microsoft’s stock currently commands a premium valuation when compared to the broader market, as well as some of its peers, reflected in its key multiples. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio stands at 14.6, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s 3.1. Similarly, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40.7 substantially exceeds the benchmark’s 22.8. This is higher than its peers, with META stock trading less than 30 times and AMZN stock trading at 39 times trailing earnings. This elevated valuation suggests market confidence in Microsoft's future performance and its strong competitive position. Microsoft's recent performance strongly suggests that a premium valuation is well-deserved. The accelerating growth in Azure revenues, coupled with improving profitability and a robust outlook, points towards a sustained upward revision in its valuation multiple. While the stock currently trades at over 40 times trailing earnings, it has historically commanded premium valuations; for example, its average price-to-earnings ratio over the last four years is 35 times. Consequently, we believe there is still further upside potential for MSFT stock, despite its recent surge. Of course, this optimistic view carries inherent risks. Investors might become hesitant to pay an even higher premium, particularly given the substantial capital expenditure Microsoft is directing towards AI initiatives. It is crucial for investors to thoroughly consider all associated risks before making any investment decisions. However, for those with a 3−5 year investment horizon, MSFT stock, even at its current levels, could offer significant upside potential. Related – MSFT Stock To $1,000? Now, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single stock, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Wall Street poised to open higher, boosted by strong earnings from AI-focused technology sector

By DAMIAN J. TROISE and ALEX VEIGA, AP Business Writers Stocks capped a choppy day of trading on Wall Street with more losses Thursday after an early big tech rally faded and a health care sector pullback led the market lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, its third straight decline. The benchmark index, which is just below the record high it set on Monday, notched a 2.2% gain for the month of July and is up 7.8% so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite closed less than 0.1% lower. Roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 lost ground, with health care companies accounting for the biggest drag on the market. Health care stocks sank after the White House released letters asking big pharmaceutical companies to cut prices and make other changes in the next 60 days. Eli Lilly & Co. fell 2.6%, UnitedHealth Group slid 6.2% and Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped 5.8%. Gains by some big technology stocks with hefty values helped temper the impact of the broader market’s decline. Meta Platforms surged 11.3% after the parent company of Facebook and Instagram crushed Wall Street’s sales and profit targets even as the company continues to pour billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. Microsoft climbed 3.9% after posting better results than analysts expected. The software pioneer also gave investors an encouraging update on its Azure cloud computing platform, which is a centerpiece of the company’s artificial intelligence efforts. Big Tech companies have regularly been the driving force behind much of the market’s gains over enthusiasm for the future of artificial intelligence. Elsewhere in the market, design software company Figma soared in its stock market debut. The stock vaulted 250% above its initial public offering price of $33 a share. All told, the S&P 500 fell 23.51 points to 6,339.39. The Dow dropped 330.30 points to 44,130.98, and the Nasdaq gave up 7.23 points to finish at 21,122.45. Earnings remain a key focus outside of the technology sector in what has been a heavy week so far for corporate financial results. CVS Health fell 0.3% after it topped Wall Street expectations for the second quarter and raised its full-year forecast again. In economic news, the Commerce Department said prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index. That’s the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure for inflation. The latest reading was slightly higher than economists expected and also marks an increase from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Results from another measure of inflation earlier this month, the consumer price index, also showed inflation rising in June. Also on Thursday, a report showed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits inched up last week. The latest updates on inflation and the jobs market are landing amid lingering concerns about the impact of tariffs. Inflation’s temperature is being closely monitored by businesses and the Fed to better gauge the impact of President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again approach to import taxes. Companies including Ford and Hershey’s have more recently warned that tariffs are weighing on their latest and projected financial results. Trump has said he will levy tariffs against goods from dozens of countries if they don’t reach agreements with the U.S. by Friday. The latest developments in the seemingly unpredictable tariff landscape include a potential pause in tariff escalations with China and a deal with South Korea. However, Trump said Thursday that he would enter a 90-day negotiating period with Mexico over trade as 25% tariff rates stay in place. The reasons behind trade policy decisions remain unpredictable. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order to impose his threatened 50% tariffs on Brazil. He has directly linked the import tax to the trial of his ally, the country’s former president Jair Bolsonaro. He has also said that trade negotiations with Canada would be more difficult in the wake of that nation’s economically unrelated decision to recognize a Palestinian state. Uncertainty over tariffs and inflation have prompted the Fed to leave its benchmark interest rate alone through the central bank’s past five meetings, including the one that ended Wednesday. The Fed has been trying to cool the rate of inflation back to its target of 2%. It has come close, but inflation remains stubbornly stuck just above that target. A cut in rates would give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also risk fueling inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pressured by Trump to cut the benchmark rate, though that decision isn’t his to make alone, but belongs to the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. “Inflation is only a bit above the Fed’s target, but looks likely to rise in the second half of the year due to tariffs,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. “With the job market in pretty good shape, they see room to hold interest rates steady and lean against inflation’s increase near-term.” Wall Street has been tempering their expectations for rate cuts at the Fed’s next meeting in September. Traders now see a 39% chance of a rate cut, according to data from CME Group. That’s down from 58.4% a week ago and a 75.4% chance a month ago. Treasury yields held steady in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was unchanged at 4.37%. The yield on the two-year Treasury remained at 3.94% from late Wednesday. Markets were mostly mixed in Asia and Europe.

Title: Parliament – OPEKEPE finale (Part A), PASOK’s touchy ones, PPC’s garbage venture, Enel and Stassinopoulos’ investments ///

– Greetings,As we said yesterday, we weren’t going to get any wiser about the OPEKEPE scandal from the parliamentary debate—unless someone actually bothered to watch it (and honestly, who in their right mind would do that at the end of July?). But if they did, they’d have come away with two things crystal clear.First: not one of the accused admitted that there was—or is—anything fishy going on with farmer and livestock subsidies, whether under this government or previously, at least since 2014, when the technical solution was put in place. In other words, neither PASOK nor SYRIZA can accuse each other of misappropriating subsidies for farmland and livestock—because they’ll both get tangled up once the Parliamentary Inquiry and audits begin. Let’s say it again: 100,000 tax IDs have illegally pocketed money—are we really saying they’re all New Democracy voters?Second: I’m told that the PASOK and SYRIZA MPs who did bother to attend the session probably realized that all this talk about “criminal organizations,” felonies, and political money doesn’t hold water. It’s one thing to turn a blind eye and let some voters or little cliques of crooks cash in—and a whole other story to claim someone’s pocketing cash on a minister’s orders and kicking back bribes. That’s unfortunately what Androulakis implied the other day, in a stunning display of sleaziness—especially coming from a PASOK guy. I mean, even Tsipras himself, back when they cooked up the Novartis case in Parliament, played the “neutral observer” just so it wouldn’t land squarely on his shoulders. PASOK glory days – KoutsoukosLet’s move on to lighter stuff—it’s almost August after all.Yesterday, the likeable former MP, former minister, former ADEDY unionist, but always-PASOK man Yiannis Koutsoukos took a jab at us for our piece about the Papandreou era, the DEI’s Mavrakis, and the 500 million drachma “gift” scandal.“You guys at protothema went overboard with Andreas and that Mavrakis gift back in 1986, just to make Mitsotakis look squeaky clean,” he wrote.To which we reply—with love:Dear Mr. Koutsoukos—PASOK, those were the days—your party leader himself talked about olive oil producers in Crete getting a bit extra from the EU funds. So how exactly does that whitewash Mitsotakis?In any case, we’re not offended, and no—we didn’t go overboard. If we had, believe me, you’d know.But since you’re keeping score—and if I’m not mistaken, you’ve been with PASOK for over 30 years—maybe you can shed some light on that Mavrakis story. Did Andreas really kick him out over a rumored 500 million drachma gift, or is it just an urban legend? And if anyone else knows more about that saga, we’re all ears. Determined to back their stocksFrom where I’m sitting, it looks like the bankers are dead set on backing their own stocks—and by extension, the stock market itself.In yesterday’s analyst briefing, Piraeus Bank CEO Christos Megalou revealed something noteworthy: the bank plans to launch a share buyback in Q4, using €100 million of the €500 million total payout to shareholders from the 2025 earnings. The bank’s leadership decided to bring forward part of the distribution plan and will proceed with the buyback in 2025. The goal is for buybacks to become a permanent fixture in the shareholder reward program. PPC invests in garbageIt’s not just water that PPC is eyeing as a strategic asset—or at least, one the government sees as a plus in the water management project.The utility is moving quickly with its redevelopment plan in Western Macedonia, rolling out two major investment initiatives: massive data centers and waste-to-energy (WtE) projects.Capitalizing on the energy transition, which is sending lignite to the history books, PPC is shaping a multi-layered energy and environmental footprint in the region, aiming to build new infrastructure and create jobs.The plan is already taking form, with the first steps toward building a WtE unit—set to serve as a pilot in circular economy practices in the former lignite region.I hear they’ve already hired a consultant and are exploring national and EU funding sources, including green investment tools. Acquisitions and investments by Enel – MacquarieBig plans for Greece are in motion at Principia—a joint venture between Enel and Macquarie Asset Management.Amid the volatile and shifting renewables landscape, Principia has aggressively expanded, acquiring four operational wind farms in Greece with a total capacity of 150 MW from EDP Renováveis for €200 million.But here’s the kicker: the deal also includes management of two high-voltage substations—adding depth to the acquisition.Over the last 8 months, Principia has boosted its installed capacity by 50.21%, reaching 727 MW. This fall, it plans to complete Greece’s first battery energy storage system (BESS), a 49MW/98MWh project in Mount Vouno, Halkidiki.What’s more, in 2026, it’s planning to start construction in Crete on a large hybrid project combining 70MWp of solar with a 111MW battery (BESS).The EDP Renováveis deal is being funded with Principia’s own capital and loans from Greek banks. M. Stassinopoulos and Metallurgy of EpirusMichalis Stassinopoulos continues to dip into his own pockets, raising the share capital of Metallurgy of Epirus by €1 million to cover losses from previous years.It’s worth noting that he did the same thing last July—adding €1.5 million.Besides minting coins, the company also produces shell casings—defense being a particularly hot sector right now. The OPAP gameIt may sound repetitive, but the Tzoker jackpot streak has hit 38 consecutive rounds—which, as you can imagine, means big bucks for OPAP.The jackpot has soared past €18 million, and OPAP is raking in an extra €2 million in revenue thanks to the hype.The organization is capitalizing on this unprecedented public interest by pushing the digital transformation of its retail network—with tools like the OPAP Store App and beefed-up loyalty programs.At HQ, the focus is now on AI and machine learning to deliver personalized customer experiences.Meanwhile, the OPAP stock has climbed past €19, with a market cap over €7 billion, making it the 6th biggest on the Athens Exchange—just behind Alpha Bank (€7.5 billion). Aegean under strange pressureYesterday marked Aegean’s seventh straight losing session. The stock dropped from €12.90 to €12.50, defying the general market uptrend.Clearly, there’s a heavy seller at play—odd, given that Aegean is flying high:It’s in a strong market position during another booming tourist season.Athens remains a hot destination even off-season.Favorable exchange rates and fuel prices are working in its favor.And the airline has a clear expansion strategy, increasing fleet size and targeting promising new routes (India, etc.).The weak dollar is especially helpful, lowering the cost of future aircraft lease payments.Plus, Aegean offers one of the highest dividend yields not just for 2025, but beyond.All analyst reports are bullish: Alpha Finance has a €14.60 target, Eurobank Equities €15.60, and Barclays is at €16—projecting much higher annual EBITDA after a stellar Q1.The company is expected to announce Q2 results in September (last year it was Sept. 11). If the first-quarter trend holds—which was its best Q1 EBITDA ever—then an upward rerating is likely. ADMIE leadership hits the roadADMIE Holdings’ market cap is closing in on €800 million, and the holding company’s leadership is gearing up for a broad and ambitious roadshow in September—not to talk about the power grid operator’s potential, but about the stock’s prospects.The first dividend will be cut on August 25, with a second one likely to follow.ADMIE is rolling out a bold €6 billion investment program through 2030, fundamentally changing its operations.The plan, backed by regulators, focuses on upgrading electrical infrastructure, strengthening energy security, and pushing Greece’s energy transition.Island interconnections (Dodecanese, Crete, Cyclades, Attica) are part of the program’s ambitious timeline. Record runs for Metlen, Aktor, GEK TERNA (and Frigoglass, Kyriakoulis for connoisseurs)From banks to heavy industry—that’s where investor interest has shifted on the Athens Exchange, keeping it close to its yearly highs and the 15-year record of 2,000 points.With a buyer surge at the close of trading, Metlen hit a new record above €47.5, just ahead of the August 4th dual listing in London and Athens.It gained 3% yesterday and closed the seven-month stretch with nearly 42% gains.GEK TERNA returned to its yearly highs, helped by a bullish report from Piraeus Securities, setting a price target at €31 (a 45% upside).The stock shook off last week’s profit-taking and is heading toward €21.5 and 25-year highs. Its next highest prices were seen back in January 2000. It’s up 15.8% so far this year.AKTOR also hit a record, touching €6.2 for the first time since October 2009.With small gains over the last six sessions, it keeps pushing multi-year highs—up more than 26.7% in 2025. The completion of AKTOR ATE’s acquisition has boosted investor sentiment.That said, the main index’s green close doesn’t reflect the session’s tone—banks came under pressure, and the action was in small caps.EYDAP fell 1.96% after five straight gains (+28.2% total), closing at €7.49 on thin volume.OLP rose 2.99% to €48.25.Big moves (for market connoisseurs only) happened in micro caps: Frigoglass soared 12.3% to €0.566 and Kyriakoulis rose 2.9% to €2.49. TIF front and center for… TIFEven though Helexpo management is keeping this year’s honored country at the Thessaloniki International Fair (TIF) under tight wraps—a month before the official opening—it seems the government’s plans for the fairground’s redevelopment have been finalized.At the Prime Minister’s speech during the 89th TIF, the complete urban renewal plan for the city center site will be announced.The government took seriously the concerns of local groups asking for more green space and less concrete.Sources say the area will retain its exhibition function, but a massive 200-stremma (20-hectare) metropolitan park will be created.Gone are the hotel and shopping mall from the original blueprint.Half the total area will become green space, with added expansion using land from the Third Army Corps and Agia Fotini.As for the honored country of the 89th TIF—negotiations with the folks in robes (read: Gulf states) aren’t easy and still involve many moving parts. The Frankfurt Stock Exchange brazenly ignores fundamentalsYesterday, official data was released showing that the German economy contracted again in the second quarter of the year. German GDP fell by -0.1% on a quarterly basis, following a -0.3% drop in the first quarter.In stark contrast, the DAX index on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange continues its impressive rise in 2025, demonstrating strong resilience and trading at new all-time highs. The DAX is soaring around the 24,250-point level, with a 12-month return of approximately +32% and a 2.44% gain in the last month. The index hit its all-time record of 24,639 points on July 10, 2025.According to the German Ministry of Finance, investment in the real economy is declining—both from the public and private sectors.The DAX’s surge is driven by a handful of strong-performing stocks like SAP, Siemens, Deutsche Telekom, Rheinmetall (boosted by defense spending), and Allianz.This upward momentum remains fragile, however, due to external geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges. Beef becomes a luxury itemIt’s not just happening in Greece. Nor just in Europe. It’s happening everywhere.The famous “New York Steak,” the iconic American cut, has now been bumped into the luxury goods category.Never before has beef been so expensive.In the U.S., retail beef prices have hit a record high of $6.10 per pound—about €10 per kilo—based on official data from the Department of Agriculture.Over the past three years, beef prices have increased by more than +50%, due to a severe shortage of cattle.Ranchers have downsized their herds due to high interest rates, expensive feed, and ongoing drought conditions.As of July 1st, the U.S. cattle inventory stood at 94.2 million head—the lowest midyear level since records began in 1973, according to the USDA.There are suspicions of oligopolistic behavior in the American economy: just four companies now control 85% of meat processing.Processors now influence 62% of the final retail price—compared to just 36% in the 1980s.Ranchers are getting poorer with meager earnings—and consumers are suffering from inflated grocery bills. China dominates rare earth exportsCNBC revealed that in June, China exported 3,188 tons of rare earth permanent magnets—marking a +160% increase compared to the previous month, May.The famed “rare earths” have now become a strategically critical market for the global high-tech industry and for the green transition.Permanent magnet rare earths are vital materials for a wide range of advanced industrial applications, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, high-efficiency electric motors, and telecommunications systems.With more than 80% of the global supply, China holds a hegemonic position in the rare earth value chain.This explosive +160% jump in June exports may be due to short-term moves by Chinese companies to take advantage of favorable prices or to get ahead of upcoming regulations and tariffs.The issue is that international demand is growing exponentially—and for now, only China can meet it.

Donald Trump matters a lot to Mzansi and the rest of the world right now. Trump is changing the way America works – and how the world’s most powerful country deals with the rest of the world. We’ll track what he does and connect the dots to your daily life. Trump falls asleep during major health launch President Donald Trump looked like he was falling asleep during a major health announcement at the White House. During a televised event on Wednesday, Trump struggled to stay awake while his health boss, Dr. Mehmet Oz, explained how the US government plans to upgrade the healthcare system using tech, apps, and artificial intelligence. As Oz spoke about diabetes, weight-loss plans, and using QR codes to manage prescriptions, Trump kept blinking slowly and closing his eyes. He looked like he wasn’t following a word. The video quickly went viral. “Trump is fighting for his life to stay awake,” joked one journalist on X. Another user wrote: “Was he up all night golfing?” But the sleepy moment came during a big shift: Americans will soon be asked to move their health records to private platforms linked to companies like Google, Amazon and Noom. These apps will read lab results, track medical progress, and even suggest diets using AI. Officials say the data will stay private and only be shared with permission. Trump didn’t respond to questions at the end. Image source: File South Africa offers cash, gas, chickens but Trump won’t budge South Africa is running out of time to stop massive US tariffs, despite offering billions in trade and investment. With just days to go before a 30% tax hits SA exports to the US, government officials say they’re still waiting for real feedback from Washington. South Africa has put a major deal on the table, including nearly R60-billion in local investment into US industries like mining and recycling, a 10-year gas import agreement, and easier access for US poultry and blueberries into the SA market. In return, it’s asking the US to scrap harsh tariffs on sectors like agriculture, shipping, and small business exports. But the US hasn’t responded, and the deadline is Friday. If nothing changes, South African exports will take a big hit. Already, car and steel exports have dropped by 30%. Citrus farmers warn their fruit could go unsold, News24 reported. Talks hit a wall over Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), which some US officials oppose. Trade Minister Parks Tau says SA has “put its best foot forward,” and a crisis plan is now being prepared. Only five countries have made deals with the US so far. South Africa says it’s ready, but the clock is ticking. Image source: File Trump turns on Israel over Gaza starvation Donald Trump has told Israel to open the gates and “let every ounce of food” into Gaza, admitting for the first time there is “real starvation” in the region. The US president made the comment during a messy 70-minute press conference at his Scottish golf course, where he met UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump directly contradicted Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who called reports of starvation “a bold-faced lie”. Trump replied: “Look at the kids. That’s real starvation. You can’t fake that.” He said Israel must do more to let aid through, while blaming Hamas for not releasing hostages. He also claimed the US and allies would set up “walk-in food centres”, but gave no details. Meanwhile, Trump said he was losing patience with Putin and gave Russia 10–12 days to agree to a Ukraine ceasefire before new sanctions kick in. He praised Starmer but told him to “cut taxes” and “get tough on immigration” if he wants to win the next UK election –comments likely to annoy Downing Street. Outside Trump’s golf course, protesters waved Palestinian flags and called him a bully. One said, “If it was my grandchildren starving, I’d want people to speak up too.” Image source: File Trump’s caddie drops the ball – literally 🚨🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿⛳️ #WATCH — A caddie was seen dropping a ball for President Donald Trump during his Scotland golf trip. Did he make par?pic.twitter.com/HgKuzHFXHa Donald Trump was caught in a cheeky golf moment during his visit to Scotland, and social media isn’t letting it slide. A video shot from a nearby building shows Trump arriving at his Turnberry golf course in a cart. As he pulls up near a tricky spot on the fairway, one of his caddies walks ahead and drops a ball on the grass. A few seconds later, Trump steps out with his club and strolls straight toward it. “Who needs talent when you’ve got a personal ball-dropper?” joked one X user. Another wrote, “Him and Kim Jong Un would be an unstoppable team.” The video popped up just hours after Trump met with European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen at the same course. Together, they announced a massive $1.35-trillion trade deal between the US and EU. Turns out, a sneaky golf ball placement gets more clicks than global economics. Image source: File Trump named in Epstein files but White House says it’s “fake news” The White House is denying reports that President Donald Trump was told in May that his name appears in files linked to Jeffrey Epstein. The Wall Street Journal says Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed Trump, telling him the documents included hundreds of names, including his, but that it didn’t mean he did anything wrong. Trump later said he was never told. A White House spokesperson called it “fake news,” while Trump’s team blamed “criminal leakers and the liberal media.” Trump had promised to release Epstein-related files during his campaign, but supporters are now angry that no “client list” has come out. The FBI says no such list exists. A judge this week refused to release grand jury records from Epstein’s 2006 Florida case, saying it would break secrecy laws. Meanwhile, Congress is trying to force the justice department to hand over files, and to make Ghislaine Maxwell testify from prison. Maxwell, jailed for helping Epstein traffic underage girls, says she’ll decide after a meeting with the justice department. Democrats say the Trump team is covering up. Even some Republicans are joining efforts to get the files released. Trump once called Epstein a “friend” but says they fell out in 2004. Image source: File Trump wants to punish South Africa over links to Russia A US committee just passed a Bill that could worsen America’s relationship with South Africa. The “US-South Africa Bilateral Relations Review Act of 2025” calls for a full review of ties between the two countries, and possible sanctions on top ANC and government officials. The Bill passed by 34 to 16, mostly supported by Republicans, and now heads to the full House. If it becomes law, the Trump administration must look at whether SA has harmed US interests, and name any leaders guilty of corruption or human rights abuse for possible US travel bans. The Bill says South Africa is close to America’s enemies, Russia, China, Iran, and even Hamas. It also slams SA for accusing Israel of genocide and pushing anti-Taiwan policies. The Bill’s sponsor, Republican Ronny Jackson, has strong links to pro-Israel donors. But top Democrat Gregory Meeks called the Bill “heavy-handed” and said it would hurt long-standing US-SA ties. South Africa’s foreign minister said diplomacy is the way forward, and denied any anti-white violence. The ANC says the Bill is politically motivated and ignores decades of shared struggle and partnership. Image source: File Trump wants minerals from Africa and a place to send migrants US President Donald Trump met five African leaders at the White House last week. It was a surprise, since Trump doesn’t usually focus on Africa. The countries he chose. Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Gabon, all have oil, gas, and rare minerals. Trump said the US wants to move from giving aid to doing trade. He even shut down the US aid agency, USAID. But trade wasn’t the only thing on the table. Trump asked the leaders to help with immigration by taking in people the US wants to deport, including asylum seekers and criminals, while their cases are still being processed. The leaders talked up their mineral wealth. Trump, not knowing Liberia speaks English, told its president he had “beautiful English.” Experts say Trump wants to lock down mineral deals and maybe find new places for US military bases in Africa, especially after Niger kicked them out. But sending migrants to poor countries won’t be easy. One analyst said instead of dumping people, the US should help African countries build jobs so their youth don’t risk dying trying to leave. Image source: File Trump demands peace but Putin won’t back down in Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t seem surprised or shaken by Donald Trump’s latest threats. Trump, who once promised to end the war in 24 hours and improve US-Russia ties, has now sent weapons to Ukraine and warned Russia of heavy sanctions if there’s no peace deal in 50 days. Putin had hoped for better ties with Trump but always made it clear that his main goal was victory in Ukraine. Kremlin insiders say Trump’s shift is disappointing, but not unexpected. A former official said, “Putin always cared more about the war than friendship with Trump.” Trump grew frustrated after six calls with Putin led nowhere. He joked that after each “nice” call, Melania would point out another bombing. Putin’s forces have been stepping up attacks, using drones and missiles to hit Ukrainian cities, the Guardian reported. Still, Moscow isn’t giving up on Trump. Russian insiders believe he’s emotional and might change course again. With over 100,000 Russian soldiers dead, Putin wants a clear win. Peace, he says, will only come if Ukraine agrees to stay neutral and gives up land. Far-right voices in Russia now say a full clash with the US is likely, and may already be underway. Image source: File Trump posts fake AI video of Obama being arrested in Oval Office Donald Trump reposts AI-generated video depicting Barack Obama being arrested. pic.twitter.com/r7dBKjHrAB US President Donald Trump posted a fake video showing former president Barack Obama being arrested by FBI agents in the Oval Office. The video, made using AI, shows Obama in handcuffs and being dragged away while Trump watches. Trump posted the video on his Truth Social platform with the words: “No one is above the law.” There was no warning that the video was fake, and many people who saw it believed it was real. Trump has often attacked Obama and claims that Obama’s government worked to destroy his presidency. Trump has also said that he wants to jail his political enemies if he wins a second term. His post comes shortly after Tulsi Gabbard, the US intelligence chief, accused Obama’s team of starting the “Russia hoax” to make Trump look bad after his 2016 election win. No evidence has been shared publicly, and Obama has not responded. The White House has not commented on the video. Image source: File Doctors reveal Trump has blood flow disease in his legs The White House has confirmed that President Donald Trump has a condition that affects blood flow in his legs. Doctors found that the 79-year-old US president is suffering from something called chronic venous insufficiency. It means his veins are not working properly, and blood is not flowing back to his heart like it should. The condition was found after Trump had some swelling in his lower legs. A White House doctor checked him and said it’s not life-threatening, but could become painful or disabling if not treated. Experts say the disease happens when vein valves are damaged or weak, causing blood to leak backwards and collect in the legs. Symptoms can include swelling, pain, cramps, itchy skin, varicose veins and even wounds that don’t heal. It’s most common in people over 70, but can also affect pregnant women, overweight people, or anyone who stands or sits too long without moving. The White House said Trump does not have any blood clots or blocked arteries, which is good news. His doctors have told him to wear special stockings and keep exercising to improve blood flow. On the same day this news came out, Trump also told his Attorney General Pam Bondi to release all secret grand jury files in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. Image source: File Trump’s 30% tariff could kill 100,000 South African jobs US President Donald Trump’s new 30% import tax on South African goods could destroy around 100,000 jobs in the country. South Africa’s Reserve Bank governor, Lesetja Kganyago, said on Wednesday that the agriculture and car-making industries will be hit the hardest. Speaking on radio station 702, Kganyago said the agriculture sector could suffer badly. “Farming employs many low-skilled workers. The new tax will hit products like oranges, grapes and wine,” he said. He also raised the alarm about South African car exports, which have already dropped by more than 80% after Trump started taxing imported cars in April. “If we don’t find other solutions, we could lose up to 100,000 jobs,” he warned. South Africa already has one of the world’s highest unemployment rates. The official jobless rate is 32.9%, and the broader rate is over 43%. Farmer groups say the new taxes will also hurt macadamia nut, fruit juice and ostrich leather exports. In the citrus industry alone, about 35,000 jobs are at risk. The new tariffs could destroy small towns like Citrusdal in the Western Cape that depend on fruit exports to the US. Image source: South African Reserve Bank Top Trump ally turns on him over Epstein case One of Donald Trump’s closest allies, Mike Johnson, now says the truth about Jeffrey Epstein must come out. Johnson is the Speaker of the House – a powerful job in the US. He says the US government must show the public all the files it has on Epstein. Epstein was a rich man who was arrested for trafficking underage girls. He died in jail in 2019. Many people don’t believe the official story that he killed himself, and they think powerful people who were involved with him are being protected. Trump had promised to make everything public. But now he says people should stop focusing on Epstein and has called the case “boring”. That has made many of Trump’s Maga supporters very angry. They believe Trump broke his promise. Johnson said: “We need to put it all out there and let people decide.” He also asked Trump’s top lawyer, Pam Bondi, to explain why she once said Epstein’s “client list” was on her desk, but hasn’t released it. Trump said Bondi can decide what files to release, but Bondi refuses to talk about Epstein. She says she’s focusing on fighting drug dealers and human traffickers. Many Maga supporters are now turning on Trump. Some are burning their red Trump hats in protest. Image source: File Trump’s wife tells him to stop being soft on Putin Donald Trump has admitted that his wife, Melania, has influenced how he deals with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump said that after having “pleasant” conversations with Putin, Melania would scold him. “I come home and say, ‘I had a great talk with Vladimir today,’ and she says, ‘Really? Another city in Ukraine just got bombed.’” Now, Trump has changed his tone. He warned Putin that Russia has 50 days to agree to a peace deal in Ukraine or face tough new tariffs. He also announced that the US will send more weapons to help Ukraine, Daily Star reported. Melania, who was born in the former communist country of Yugoslavia and grew up in Slovenia, has strong views about Russia’s war in Ukraine. She says she remembers what it was like living under a communist government and often reminds Trump of the suffering in Eastern Europe. Even though Melania no longer lives full-time at the White House, Trump said they speak often and that she “knows what she’s talking about”. Trump’s warning to Russia comes just months after he called Putin “crazy” and begged him to stop bombing Ukraine. He said if no peace deal is reached in 50 days, he will hit Russia and its trade partners with heavy tariffs. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he spoke to Trump on the phone this week and that they agreed to speak more regularly about how to end the war. Image source: File Trump crowns himself as ‘Superman’ Donald Trump has shared an image of himself as Superman, complete with muscles, a tight suit, and a cape. The AI-generated picture, posted on the official White House social media page, shows Trump’s face on a superhero body and includes the words: “THE SYMBOL OF HOPE. TRUTH. JUSTICE. THE AMERICAN WAY. SUPERMAN TRUMP.” The post is part of Trump’s ongoing efforts to present himself as a strong leader ahead of the 2026 elections. He’s often said he’s the only one who can save America, and now he’s using superhero-style images to back it up. But not all his supporters are happy. Some MAGA followers have started burning their red hats in protest after the White House said there would be no further public release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Videos online show frustrated Trump supporters setting their caps on fire. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump’s army using robot animals to protect air bases Donald Trump’s US military has deployed robot coyotes to guard air bases as part of his push to use high-tech tools to protect Americans and look tough doing it. The fake animals are designed to scare away birds and other wildlife that could damage fighter jets or cause crashes during take-off and landing. They’ve been rolled out at major US air bases after successful trials. Each robot is shaped like a coyote, a wild animal similar to a jackal, and rides around on wheels like a remote-controlled guard dog. Coyotes are natural predators of many smaller animals, and their presence is enough to keep birds from settling near runways. The US Army’s research team developed the cyborg coyotes alongside the Department of Agriculture. The goal: protect expensive aircraft and military crews from bird strikes and animal interference. The move fits with Trump’s image-heavy military style. He often talks about “peace through strength” and has supported flashy defence projects involving space weapons, military parades and giant spending plans. Officials say the robot coyotes may soon be upgraded with cameras, sensors, and even artificial intelligence. Image source: @armenberjikly Trump bragged he threatened to bomb Moscow and Beijing in secret talks Donald Trump told private donors that he once warned Vladimir Putin he would “bomb the s*** out of Moscow” if Russia invaded Ukraine. The comments were caught on new recordings from Trump’s presidential campaign. Trump claimed he told Putin directly: “If you go into Ukraine, I’m gonna bomb the s*** out of Moscow.” He said Putin didn’t believe him but added, “10% was enough.” The recordings are featured in a new book called 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America. Trump also claimed he gave the same warning to Chinese president Xi Jinping, threatening to “bomb the s*** out of Beijing” if China attacked Taiwan. “He thought I was crazy,” Trump said in the recording. “But he believed me 10%. That’s all I needed.” Despite saying he could end the war in Ukraine in “24 hours,” Trump has failed to stop the conflict since returning to office. This week, he announced more US military support for Ukraine after talks with Putin made no progress. In the same recordings, Trump said student protesters supporting Palestine should be kicked out of the country. “Throw them out,” he said. “That will stop it.” He also bragged about pressuring a rich donor into giving him R460-million, saying the man originally only wanted to give him R18-million. The White House and the Kremlin have not yet responded to Trump’s comments. Image source: File Trump says no more delays for new tax on South African goods US President Donald Trump says that new, higher taxes on goods coming from other countries, including South Africa, will start on 1 August. He says there will be no more delays or changes. Trump had already put a 10% tax on imports from almost every country back in April. Then in July, he said some countries would be taxed even more, but he paused those increases. Now, he says the bigger taxes will go ahead as planned. In messages sent to leaders around the world, Trump said countries like South Africa, Japan, South Korea and others will face taxes of between 25% and 40% on goods they send to the US. He also warned that if any country hits back with their own taxes, the US will raise its taxes even more. Trump said this will bring in lots of money for the US. His finance minister said the US could make more than $300-billion from these taxes by the end of the year. Trump says the taxes are meant to fix “unfair” trade deals. But some people are worried the plan will make goods more expensive and cause problems between countries. The US has only made a few new trade deals so far, with the UK, Vietnam and China. Talks with other countries are still going. Image source: File Trump hits South Africa with 30% tax on all goods US President Donald Trump is putting a 30% tax on everything South Africa sends to America – and it starts in August. Trump has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa and other world leaders, saying it’s time to stop what he calls “unfair trade”. He says South Africa has had an advantage for too long by using trade rules that favour it and not the US. The tariff will hit South African products being sold in America. Ramaphosa tried to get Trump to back down, but it didn’t work. Trump says the US trade deficit (when a country imports more than it exports) is a threat to both the economy and national security. He also warned that if any country tries to fight back, he’ll raise the tariffs even more. Ramaphosa has responded, saying Trump’s view of trade between the two countries is simply wrong. Image source: File Trump slams Elon Musk for starting new political party Donald Trump has attacked Elon Musk on social media, calling him a “train wreck” who has “gone off the rails.” The US president spoke just after Musk announced he’s launching a new political group called the “America Party.” Trump said third parties don’t work in the US and only cause “chaos.” He claimed the system is built for two major parties and accused Musk of trying to disrupt the country when there’s already too much division. He also said Musk is upset because Trump’s new tax-and-spending bill removes the electric vehicle (EV) mandate – a rule that would’ve pushed more people to buy EVs. Trump says Americans should be able to choose between petrol cars, hybrids or electric vehicles. He added that Musk had backed him before, even though Trump was always against the EV mandate. The president also said Musk once asked for a friend to lead NASA, but that person turned out to be a Democrat who had never supported Republicans. Trump said that was a red flag, especially because NASA works so closely with SpaceX, Musk’s company. Trump ended by saying his job is to protect the American people. His comments follow Musk’s announcement that the “America Party” will contest elections starting in 2026. Musk said the new party will break the power of the two-party system by focusing on a small number of key seats. Though Musk was born in South Africa and cannot run for president himself, he has been vocal about wanting political change. In a poll he ran on social media, two-thirds of voters backed the idea of a new party. Musk said that was enough to launch it officially, saying the country needs “freedom from the one-party system.” Image source: File Trump celebrates new bill and says UFC fight is coming to the White House Donald Trump has kicked off 4 July celebrations by bragging about his new tax-and-spending bill, and announcing that a UFC fight will take place on the White House lawn. Speaking at a rally in Iowa, Trump said: “There could be no better birthday present for America” than the passing of his new bill, which makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent and increases spending on the military and border security. But the bill also cuts healthcare and food support for low-income Americans and will add $3.3 trillion to the US budget deficit over 10 years. During the rally, Trump also said he plans to celebrate America’s 250th birthday (in 2026) with a national state fair and a live UFC championship fight for up to 25,000 people at the White House. “Dana [White, UFC boss] is going to do it. We have a lot of land there,” Trump said. He also mocked Joe Biden, repeated false claims about a stolen election, and attacked Democrats. “I hate them. I really do,” he said. “Because I believe they hate our country.” Trump hinted at a softer stance on immigration, saying farm workers could stay in the US if their employers vouch for them. “We don’t want to remove workers from the farms,” he told supporters. Image source: File America admits Iran’s nuclear sites weren’t ‘obliterated’ like Trump claimed The US Pentagon has admitted that Donald Trump exaggerated when he said he had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites. A spokesperson for the Pentagon, Sean Parnell, said the real damage from the US airstrikes probably only set Iran’s nuclear programme back by one or two years, not destroyed it completely. This comes after Trump celebrated the bombing of Iran’s Fordow site, calling it a huge win and saying the country’s nuclear programme was “completely and totally gone.” But intelligence officials have avoided using Trump’s word “obliterated.” At a press conference, Parnell repeated the word, but admitted that Iran could rebuild in time. “We believe the facilities were heavily damaged,” he said. “But their programme may only be delayed by a year or two.” The bombs used, called “bunker busters”, are designed to hit deep underground. But Iran’s nuclear knowledge and tech were not destroyed. Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran still has the skill to restart the programme. “You can’t destroy the knowledge,” he said. Trump had also claimed that the bombing helped him get a ceasefire deal between Israel and Iran, calling it the end of the “12-day war.” But fighting restarted the next day, with both countries blaming each other. The Pentagon is now pushing back against media reports that the strike wasn’t as successful as Trump claimed. Parnell accused journalists of using “false and incomplete” information to make the military look bad. Image source: File Trump says Israel is ready for Gaza peace deal Donald Trump says Israel is now ready to agree to a peace deal with Hamas to end the war in Gaza, a war that has already killed nearly 60,000 people. In a post on his Truth Social page, Trump said: “Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalise the 60-day ceasefire.” He added that during that time, the US will try to help all sides reach a full peace agreement. Trump said that Qatar and Egypt, two countries helping to mediate, would now deliver the “final proposal” to Hamas. So far, neither Israel nor Hamas has officially responded to Trump’s announcement. It’s not clear exactly what Israel has agreed to. In the past, similar ceasefire talks have collapsed quickly, with both sides accusing each other of breaking deals, especially around prisoner swaps. Still, Trump seems confident. Speaking to reporters, he said a deal could be reached as soon as next week and that he will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday. “We want the hostages out, and we want the war to end,” Trump said, the Guardian reported. Hamas has said it is willing to release the remaining hostages in exchange for a deal to end the war. Israel, on the other hand, says the war can only stop if Hamas gives up all weapons and control, something Hamas has refused. Trump is trying to use momentum from the recent Israel-Iran ceasefire and the joint US-Israeli bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites to help secure peace in Gaza. He also warned Hamas not to miss this chance. “It will not get better, it will only get worse,” he said. Trump’s announcement came just after an Israeli airstrike hit a café in Gaza on Monday, killing between 24 and 36 people, including children, according to reports. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages. Since then, more than 56,500 Palestinians have been killed and nearly the entire population of Gaza has been displaced. Much of the area has been destroyed. Image source: File Trump says Elon Musk would be “back in South Africa” without US money Donald Trump has attacked Elon Musk, saying he only became rich because of US government money, and without it, he’d be back living in South Africa. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said: “Elon may get more help from the government than any person in history. Without that, he’d probably have to close his businesses and go back to South Africa.” Trump said there would be “no more rockets, no more satellites, no more electric cars” if the government stopped giving Musk support. He added: “We’d save a fortune.” This comes after Musk complained about Trump’s new tax plan. The plan removes money and support for electric cars and clean energy. Musk said cutting this support would be “very bad” for the country. Tesla, Musk’s electric car company, has been getting a $7,500 (R133,000) tax break for each car sold. But Trump’s plan would stop that. Tesla is also expected to report poor sales this week. Trump reminded people that he never supported forcing people to buy electric cars. “Electric cars are okay, but no one should be forced to drive one,” he said. Trump also said Musk supported him for president, even though he knew Trump didn’t like electric vehicle laws. Image source: File Trump says he’s found ‘rich buyers’ to take over TikTok Donald Trump says a group of very rich people are ready to buy TikTok’s US operations, but they’ll need permission from China before the deal can happen. Speaking to Fox News, Trump said: “We have a buyer for TikTok. I think China will probably approve it.” He added he would reveal who the buyers are in about two weeks. The US government has been trying to force TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app’s American side or face a total ban. The deadline to make the deal is now set for September 17. TikTok is still very popular in the US, especially with younger users. Trump has even said it helped him connect with young voters during the 2024 election. But the big problem is TikTok’s algorithm, the smart technology that decides what videos people see. It’s protected by Chinese law and is listed in China’s official tech database, which means it can’t be sold easily. China has said before that it might block any sale, especially if it involves the algorithm. And Trump’s tough stance on China, including new tariffs earlier this year, has made things even more difficult. Image source: File Trump posts “Daddy’s Home” video after NATO boss calls him daddy 🎶 Daddy’s home… Hey, hey, hey, Daddy.President Donald J. Trump attended the NATO Summit in The Hague, Netherlands. pic.twitter.com/asJb5FD2Ii Donald Trump just posted a video of himself at a big NATO meeting, using Usher’s song “Daddy’s Home” as the soundtrack. Yes, really. The clip shows Trump walking around the NATO summit like he’s the star of an R&B music video. The words “Daddy’s Home” flash across the screen as Usher’s hit plays in the background. It comes after NATO boss Mark Rutte bizarrely called Trump “daddy” during a press meeting earlier this week. Rutte was trying to describe Trump’s wild rant about Israel and Iran, where Trump said: “Let them fight for a few minutes, it’s easier to stop them.” Rutte jumped in with: “And then daddy has to use strong words to stop them.” Not “Dad.” Not “President.” Just “daddy.” People online quickly slammed Rutte, calling it a clear case of sucking up to Trump. Even Trump joined in the joke, telling reporters: “Daddy, you’re my daddy.” Now the White House has made things even worse with the video, featuring a song that’s full of sexual lyrics. Image source: File Trump turns on spy boss Tulsi over Iran bombing report Donald Trump’s spy boss, Tulsi Gabbard, has been left out of a big security meeting with US lawmakers, and some insiders say she’s now in “the line of fire.” Gabbard was supposed to join top Trump officials in a closed-door briefing with Congress to talk about the recent US strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. But now she’s suddenly off the list, and people close to the White House say Trump blames her for a damaging leak, the Daily Mail reported. Last week, Trump blasted Gabbard after she said Iran wasn’t close to making a nuclear weapon. He told reporters, “She’s wrong.” Gabbard quickly changed her position, saying Iran could make a bomb “within weeks to months.” But the damage was done. A leaked Pentagon report showed the US bombing may have only delayed Iran’s nuclear programme by a few months, far less than what Trump had claimed. Trump said the sites were “obliterated.” The report said Iran might be able to restart soon. Now, there’s a full-blown investigation into who leaked the report, and some White House insiders say Gabbard could be the one who gets the blame. Trump biographer Michael Wolff said: “Tulsi is in the line of fire. Trump always needs someone to blame.” Even though Gabbard publicly supported Trump and said the attacks destroyed Iran’s facilities, she’s been cut from the team giving the official update to Congress. Trump is furious at media reports saying the strike didn’t do enough. He’s attacking CNN and The New York Times, saying they’re lying to make him look weak. CNN reporter Natasha Bertrand broke the story. Trump posted that she should be “fired and thrown out like a dog.” CNN fired back, saying they stand by her reporting. Image source: File US bombs didn’t stop Iran’s nuclear plans A new report says the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites last weekend didn’t destroy them completely, and may have only delayed Iran’s plans by a few months. US President Donald Trump said after the attacks that the sites were “totally destroyed” and that Iran’s nuclear programme was “obliterated.” But a secret report from the Pentagon now says that’s not true. It says some of Iran’s nuclear machines were not fully destroyed, and that Iran had moved a lot of its uranium before the bombs hit. That means they might be able to restart the programme soon, the Guardian reported. The US used big B-2 bombers and huge “bunker-buster” bombs on three sites, Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. But one of the sites, Fordow, is buried deep under a mountain, and the bombs couldn’t reach all the way down. The report says Fordow is likely still working and may be used again soon. Trump posted in all capital letters on his social media: “THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!” He’s angry the report got out and says it’s an attempt to make him look bad. But US military leaders are being more careful. One general said the sites were badly damaged, but they are still checking how much was really destroyed. The head of the world’s nuclear watchdog says they don’t know where 400kg of Iran’s uranium has gone. And US Vice President JD Vance admitted they still don’t know where the rest of Iran’s nuclear material is hiding. Image source: File Three people killed in Israel just after Trump announces ceasefire Just hours after US President Donald Trump said the war between Israel and Iran was over, missiles from Iran hit Israel, killing three people. Iran fired six waves of missiles early Tuesday morning, with explosions heard in Tel Aviv and Beersheba. Three people died in Beersheba, according to emergency workers. This happened soon after Trump said he had made a peace deal with Israel and Iran to end the 12-day war. He thanked both countries and said on social media that it was “a historic moment.” But Iran said the fighting would only stop if Israel stopped its attacks. One Iranian official said they had not fully agreed to stop the war. Iran’s last missiles were fired just before the ceasefire was supposed to begin. Over the weekend, the US and Israel bombed Iran’s nuclear sites. Iran denies building nuclear weapons, but Trump said the goal was to stop them from ever getting one. The US dropped heavy “bunker-buster” bombs on underground sites. After days of bombing, many people in Tehran have left the city. Trump said Iran warned them before attacking a US base and that no Americans were hurt. He said he will push Israel to choose peace. Talks between Iran and other countries are still happening. Qatar helped set up the peace deal, and US leaders like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were involved. Image source: File Iran tells Trump to “bring enough coffins” if you want war An Iranian leader has warned Donald Trump that if the US starts a full war with Iran, they should “bring enough coffins” for their soldiers. This came after the US bombed three of Iran’s nuclear sites using powerful B-2 bombers. Iran is angry and says it will fight back. Ebrahim Rezaei, a top member of Iran’s parliament, said: “Don’t expect us to bury your soldiers. Bring your own coffins.” Tensions are rising fast between Iran, Israel and the US. Many world leaders are calling for peace, but Iran’s army and other powerful groups say they are ready to hit back hard. The US says they don’t want war. Their defence chief said the attack was not meant to kill people, but to stop Iran’s nuclear programme. “This is not about removing Iran’s government,” he said. But Trump is not backing down. On his Truth Social page, he called the attack “a historic moment” and told Iran: “End the war now.” He also warned Iran that if they keep fighting, “there will be peace or there will be tragedy.” Iran says the US helped Israel start a dangerous war and has now made things worse. Some experts warn this could lead to more terrorism and attacks on US soldiers and allies. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump gives himself two weeks to decide on Iran attack Donald Trump says he’ll decide in the next two weeks if the US will join Israel in bombing Iran. This comes as fighting between Israel and Iran enters its second week, with both sides firing missiles and the danger of a bigger war growing fast. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters: “There’s a chance for talks with Iran. The president will decide in the next two weeks if the US will go to war or not.” Trump has also asked the US military if their biggest bombs, the 30,000-pound “bunker busters”, could destroy Iran’s hidden nuclear sites. He says he wants a peaceful solution but is also ready to use force. When asked what his message is to people who voted for him because they wanted “no more wars,” Leavitt replied: “Trust in President Trump.” Trump also said Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to help make peace, but Trump refused, telling him: “Let’s fix Russia first.” Trump is reportedly thinking about attacking Iran’s Fordo nuclear site, a hidden base deep underground. So far, Israel hasn’t hit that target, but Trump might. He’s also posted online that Iran’s leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is “an easy target”, though he says there are no plans to kill him “for now.” Iran has warned the US that choosing war would bring “irreparable harm.” Image source: File Trump says “I may do it” as he thinks about attacking Iran Donald Trump says he hasn’t decided if the US will join Israel in attacking Iran. When asked about it, he gave a short answer: “I may do it, I may not.” He also said, “Nobody knows what I want to do.” Trump believes Iran is in big trouble and says they want to talk. He told reporters that Iran might even come to the White House for talks. But then he also warned that he’s “had it” and wants “unconditional surrender.” Iran’s top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, replied with a warning. He said if the US chooses war, it will cause “irreparable harm.” Iran also said they will not beg or give in to the US. Trump must make a decision soon. US officials say the next 24 hours are very important. Trump doesn’t want to look weak while the fighting between Israel and Iran continues. At the same time, the US has moved warships and planes closer to the region. But the White House says they are only there for defence. Trump also said Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to help make peace between Israel and Iran. But Trump told him: “Let’s fix Russia first.” Image source: File People say more pizza orders in the US mean war is coming An online theory claimed that a rise in pizza deliveries near the Pentagon was a secret sign that war was about to break out. But it turns out Pentagon staff were just… hungry. The idea went viral last week as Israel launched major strikes on Iran. A group of internet sleuths, running the so-called “Pentagon Pizza Report”, noticed a spike in pizza orders near the US defence HQ just before the bombs dropped. They told their 100,000 followers: “All nearby pizza establishments have experienced a HUGE surge in activity.” According to them, when Pentagon staff are working late on military plans, they order loads of pizza — and that’s the first clue that something big is coming. But the White House has now shut that theory down. Officials said the US government already knew about the attacks ahead of time — no pizza clues needed. Experts also rubbished the idea, calling it “confirmation bias” and saying there’s no solid proof. The Pentagon does have late-night food available, but they don’t track what staff are eating. So no, America isn’t using pepperoni pizza to signal a strike. Meanwhile, the real news is much more serious. The Israel-Iran conflict is now in its fifth day. Israel has bombed Iranian targets. Iran fired back at major cities. The region is on edge. Donald Trump has jumped in too. After leaving the G7 summit early, he warned Iran’s supreme leader on Truth Social that the US “knows exactly where he is” — but claimed there were “no plans to take him out (kill), at least not for now.” US officials say Trump is also thinking about joining Israel in attacking Iran’s nuclear sites. So while the missiles are very real, the pizza warning system is not. Sometimes a delivery is just dinner. Image source: File Trump leaves G7 early as Israel-Iran war threat grows Donald Trump is leaving the G7 summit early as the fight between Israel and Iran explodes. He’s heading back to Washington on Monday, skipping the second day of talks in Canada. This comes after Trump warned people in Tehran, Iran’s capital, to evacuate immediately on his Truth Social account. Earlier, Israel told parts of Tehran to clear out before bombing military targets. Now, with things getting worse, Trump says he needs to be home to deal with it. The White House said he’ll still attend the G7 photo and dinner before leaving. But his early exit upset other leaders, who hoped the US would help push for peace. A draft statement said Iran must not get nuclear weapons, and that Israel has the right to defend itself. Trump didn’t sign it, but posted, “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” He also hinted he might try to help end the conflict: “They want to make a deal… but I have to leave here.” Meanwhile, Israel is bombing Iranian sites, and Iran is firing missiles at Israeli cities. Iran also warned it may leave the global nuclear treaty. Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, said killing Iran’s top leader would end the war. The US isn’t in the fight yet, but is moving warships and planes closer. The USS Nimitz is heading to the Middle East to join another US carrier, and two destroyers have moved near Israel. Image source: @WhiteHouse Israel ignores Trump’s orders and attacks Iran Donald Trump told Israel not to bomb Iran. They did it anyway. Just hours before the attack, Trump said he didn’t want Israel to go in, warning it could ruin his peace talks with Iran. But Israeli warplanes launched the strike without US support, and without waiting for Trump’s approval. Now Trump is caught in a dangerous situation. His efforts to calm things down with Iran are at risk, and thousands of US troops in the region could be in danger if things get worse. Trump’s top diplomat was preparing for talks in Oman when the attack happened. Trump had already asked Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to hold off. He didn’t listen. Republicans like Senator Lindsey Graham cheered the move, but Trump’s not interested in starting new wars. Unlike past presidents, he doesn’t want the US dragged into foreign fights unless America is directly attacked. After the airstrike, the US made it clear they had nothing to do with it. A short statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: “Israel acted alone. Our priority is keeping American forces safe.” Image source: File Elon Musk says sorry for going too far about Trump Elon Musk has said sorry to US President Donald Trump after the two had a big fight online. “I went too far,” Musk wrote on X on Wednesday. “I regret some of my posts about President Trump.” Last week, the two were throwing insults at each other. Trump said he might stop giving government money to Musk’s company, SpaceX. Musk, in return, said Trump’s name was linked to the Epstein scandal, something Trump strongly denies. Trump hit back, saying Musk had “lost his mind”. Now, people close to Musk say he’s calming down and might want to be friends again. He even deleted a post where he supported removing Trump from office. Musk’s apology came after Trump warned him: “If he keeps trying to punish Republicans, there will be serious consequences.” But Trump didn’t say what those consequences would be. Earlier this year, there were rumours Trump might sell off his Tesla shares, but nothing happened. Even though things got ugly, Trump has stopped attacking Musk for now. He said he wishes Musk well and wants Musk’s satellite internet company, Starlink, to keep running. Vice President JD Vance said Musk made a “huge mistake” by going after Trump. He called Musk’s angry posts “emotional” and said, “I hope Elon comes back, but maybe it’s too late, he went nuclear.” Image source: File Photos show Trump may be wearing a catheter on his leg Photos of Donald Trump at the White House have gone viral after people noticed a weird bulge in his left pant leg. Many think he might be wearing a catheter, which is a medical tube that drains urine into a bag. The bulge looks like tubing running down his leg. Some say it’s a Foley catheter, which is often used for people with bladder problems. Others shared diagrams of how catheters work and said it matches the shape seen in the photos. A few people suggested it might be a leg brace or just wrinkled pants, but many online are convinced it’s a medical device. Trump has not commented, and his doctor has never mentioned any catheter or health issues like this. Still, the internet is buzzing with rumours about his health based on the pictures. Image source: @patriottakes Trump wants to give R18,000 to every baby born in the US Donald Trump has shared a new idea that every baby born in the US between 2025 and 2029 will get $1,000 (R18,000) from the government. The money will go into a special savings account that grows with the stock market. Parents can also add more money, up to $5,000 a year. Trump says this plan will help kids build money for their future. Big business leaders like the CEOs of Uber, Goldman Sachs, and Dell have promised to add billions more to support this idea. The plan is part of a big new law that Trump calls his “beautiful bill.” It’s already passed in the House of Representatives but still needs to pass the Senate. If it doesn’t pass, the baby accounts won’t happen. Trump says the money for this plan will come from changes to welfare programs and a new tax on money sent out of the country. But a government report says the plan would actually add $2.4-trillion to the national debt and cut healthcare and food help for millions of people. Some experts also say the baby accounts aren’t the best way to invest money, and other savings plans might work better. Still, Trump believes the accounts will give kids a good start in life. Other countries like the UK and Singapore have done similar things before, giving money to kids to help them save early. Trump and his supporters say if this bill doesn’t pass, Americans might face higher taxes. So they’re pushing for Congress to approve it soon. Image source: File Trump sends troops to Los Angeles and says “we’ll be everywhere” President Donald Trump has sent troops into Los Angeles after protests broke out over immigration raids. He warned that “troops will be everywhere” and said he wouldn’t let the protests continue. The protests started after ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents raided a detention centre and arrested a union leader. Police used tear gas and flash-bangs on protesters, and the scene quickly got tense. Trump blamed California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, saying they weren’t doing their jobs. He made fun of Newsom on social media, calling him “Newscum,” and said protesters shouldn’t be allowed to wear masks. Governor Newsom responded, saying Trump was trying to “create chaos” so he could send in more troops and scare people. He told everyone to stay calm and peaceful. Around 300 National Guard soldiers were sent to LA over the weekend to help control the protests. ICE said they would keep arresting people who tried to stop their raids. Image source: @USBPChief Elon Musk and Donald Trump go from besties to enemies Donald Trump and Elon Musk used to be best buds. Now, they’re fighting like two celebs in a bad reality show. It all started when Musk called Trump’s new tax bill “disgusting” and told Americans to call Congress and stop it. He even posted a picture from the movie Kill Bill to make his point. Trump didn’t stay quiet. He fired back from the White House, saying he might cancel Musk’s government deals and cut off his billions in funding. Musk clapped back: “Go ahead, make my day.” Then things got even messier. Musk claimed Trump’s name was in the secret Jeffrey Epstein files. There’s no proof, but Musk’s post went viral. Just a few days ago, the two were all smiles in the White House, with Trump even giving Musk a goodbye gift as he left his short government job at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk also said Trump would have lost the election without him, and called him ungrateful. Trump replied, saying Elon had “turned on him” and only got upset because the new bill cuts tax breaks for electric cars. Musk said he never even saw the bill, and accused Trump of hiding it from Congress. Then Musk joked that Trump must have been replaced by a body double, because he used to say the same things Musk is saying now. Just when you thought it couldn’t get wilder, Trump’s old advisor Steve Bannon said Musk should be deported and investigated, claiming he might be in the US illegally. Image source: File Trump banned travel from a country that does not exist US President Donald Trump is being laughed at online after banning travel from a country that hasn’t existed for over 30 years. Trump signed a new executive order blocking people from entering the US from 12 countries. One of them was “Burma,” but that country officially changed its name to Myanmar in 1989. The full list of banned countries includes Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and others. The White House says the travel ban is meant to keep the US safe. But critics say it unfairly targets certain countries and reminds them of Trump’s earlier “Muslim ban” from 2017, which caused protests and confusion at airports. This new ban comes after a recent attack in Colorado, where an immigrant from Egypt was arrested. But Egypt is not on the list. People online mocked Trump for not knowing that Burma and Myanmar are the same country. Others say the ban is more about politics than safety, and that it could hurt the US’s image around the world. Image source: File Elon Musk calls Trump’s tax plan ‘a disgusting mess’ Elon Musk has slammed US President Donald Trump’s new tax and spending plan, calling it “outrageous” and “a disgusting mess.” The plan, which gives huge tax breaks and increases spending, was passed by Republican lawmakers in May. Trump called it a “big, beautiful bill.” But Musk strongly disagreed. On his social media platform X, he wrote: “This massive spending bill is a disgrace. Shame on those who voted for it.” Musk had been working in the Trump government for a short time to help cut waste and lower spending. His team was called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But last week, Musk quit the role. He said trying to fix problems in Washington was harder than expected. At a press event, the White House brushed off Musk’s complaints. Trump’s spokesperson said the president still supports the bill. Musk warned that the bill would raise the national debt to $2.5-trillion and said voters should remove the politicians who supported it. Musk had big plans to cut $2-trillion in government spending, but only managed $150-billion. He also faced backlash over cuts to foreign aid and clashed with other Trump officials, Daily Star reported. His short-term role in government was always limited to 130 days. That time ended at the end of May. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump misled about ‘white genocide’ in South Africa, says adviser Mark Burns Mark Burns, a US pastor and adviser to Donald Trump, says the former president may have been misled about claims that white farmers are being targeted and killed in South Africa. Burns is visiting South Africa for the first time and says the country reminds him of his home state, South Carolina. In an interview with the Mail & Guardian, Burns said he was surprised to learn from South Africans of all races that most people don’t believe in the so-called “white genocide” narrative. He added that of the over 5,000 murders in the last part of 2024, only 12 were farmers, and just three were white. Burns said he met with white Afrikaner farmers who confirmed crime is a problem but denied being targeted for their race. He believes Trump may change his view if he visits South Africa himself and gets accurate information. Burns described Trump as a “man of peace” who wants prosperity for all countries. He said Trump sometimes reacts to what’s shown to him without knowing the full truth and would rethink things if given better information. He also warned that South Africa’s role in Brics, a group that includes Russia and China, could hurt relations with the US by challenging the US dollar. Burns said this makes trade and negotiations harder. Asked if Trump would attend the G20 summit in South Africa later this year, Burns said he couldn’t speak for him, but he would advise him to come and see the situation for himself. Image source: File Trump claims that Biden is a clone US President Donald Trump has shared a shocking post online that says Joe Biden died in 2020 and was replaced by a clone or robot. The original post, made by someone else on social media, said: “There is no Joe Biden – he was executed in 2020. What you see now are clones and robotic copies.” Trump didn’t comment, but he reposted it on his platform, Truth Social, which made it go viral. Some of Trump’s supporters believed it, saying things like “We always knew something was wrong.” Others pointed out things like Biden’s changing eye colour as “proof” he had been replaced, Daily Star reported. But many people laughed at the idea and called it just another crazy conspiracy. One person wrote, “Do you think the Earth is flat too?” Trump has shared strange claims before. He once said Barack Obama wasn’t born in the US and suggested Ted Cruz’s father helped kill President John F. Kennedy. He’s also supported QAnon and made false claims about the 2020 election being stolen. Despite not having any proof, Trump continues to share these kinds of stories, and some of his fans continue to believe them. Image source: File Trump gives Putin two weeks to prove he wants peace in Ukraine US President Donald Trump has warned Russia’s Vladimir Putin that he has two weeks to show he’s serious about ending the war in Ukraine, or the US will respond differently. At the White House, Trump said: “I can’t tell if Putin wants peace, but we’ll find out in two weeks. If he’s just playing games, we’ll act differently.” Trump has recently called Putin “crazy” and accused him of “playing with fire” after Russia launched one of its deadliest attacks on Ukraine in years. At least 13 people, including children, were killed in Kyiv over the weekend. Earlier, Trump and Putin spoke on the phone for two hours. Trump said the call went “very well,” but no peace deal followed, and Russia kept bombing, BBC reported. So far, Trump’s administration has mostly pressured Ukraine, even pausing military support in March. Critics say this makes Russia feel stronger. Russia has now demanded that Ukraine give up land and that the US recognise Crimea as Russian territory. A Kremlin official said Trump doesn’t understand what’s really happening and blamed Ukraine for attacking Russian cities. Meanwhile, Germany has offered Ukraine longer-range missiles, which Russia says could damage peace efforts. Trump is now focusing on a possible summit with Putin instead of pushing for an immediate ceasefire. But with Russia holding about 20% of Ukraine and peace talks going nowhere, the war continues. Zelensky says Russia is stalling, while Moscow claims a peace plan is almost ready. Image source: File Elon Musk quits Trump team after arguing over government spending Elon Musk has decided to leave his role as an adviser to US President Donald Trump. The billionaire businessman said he’s had enough of politics and is frustrated by how slowly things work in government. Musk, who runs Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter), announced on X that his time helping the Trump administration has come to an end. He thanked Trump and said his plan to cut wasteful government spending, called the DOGE mission, will still continue without him. Musk had been helping Trump try to cut down the US government’s budget, but said the system is more broken than he expected. “It’s harder to fix things in Washington than I thought,” he told The Washington Post. He quit shortly after criticising Trump’s new spending bill, calling it too expensive and saying it added more debt. In an interview with CBS, Musk joked that the bill was “big” but not “beautiful,” poking fun at Trump’s description of it. Trump said he’s not happy with every part of the bill, but still supports it overall. Musk had been working part-time for the government since January and helped Trump’s campaign with millions in donations. But now he says he’s stepping away from politics completely and going back to focus on his businesses. “I think I’ve done enough,” Musk said. Image source: File Ramaphosa jokes about Trump meeting: ‘I get nervous when the lights go off now’ President Cyril Ramaphosa made a lighthearted joke on Tuesday about his unusual meeting with US President Donald Trump last week. Speaking at an event in Cape Town, Ramaphosa said he now feels uneasy whenever the lights go dim, because of what happened in the Oval Office. During his meeting with Trump, the US president suddenly told staff to turn off the lights and play a video on a TV in the room. The video showed EFF leader Julius Malema singing “Kill the Boer,” a controversial song. The moment caught Ramaphosa by surprise. At Tuesday’s event, when the lights dimmed as he walked onto stage, Ramaphosa joked: “When I saw the room going dark, I thought, what’s going on? Is this happening again?” He laughed and said it reminded him of what happened with Trump. He also joked with journalist Clement Manyathela, who was at both the Trump meeting and the Tuesday event. “Seeing you again gave me flashbacks,” he said, smiling. Ramaphosa said people later told him the Oval Office moment was “an ambush,” but he just found it confusing and unexpected. “I thought we were getting into a good discussion, and then suddenly the lights went out and a video was playing,” he said. Image source: File Russia could attack Europe by 2027 A new report warns that Russia might be ready to attack European countries as soon as 2027, if the war in Ukraine ends or slows down soon. The report, from a top London research group (the International Institute of Strategic Studies), says that a ceasefire would give Russia time to rebuild its army. Even though Russia has lost many tanks and vehicles in Ukraine, it’s already starting to replace them, the Daily Star reported. Experts say that if Russia gets a break from the war, it could rebuild its forces and pose a serious threat to nearby countries like Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania within two years. Leaders in Europe, including France’s President Emmanuel Macron, have also warned that Russia still has big military goals and may not stop with Ukraine. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said last year, “It’s not a question of if they’ll start another war, but when.” There’s also growing concern about NATO, the alliance that protects many Western countries. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned whether America should continue to defend NATO countries that don’t spend enough on their military. “If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them,” Trump told reporters after returning to office. Experts say that if the US pulls back from NATO, it could weaken the group, making it easier for Russia to act more aggressively in Europe. Image source: File Trump warns Putin that taking all of Ukraine will destroy Russia US President Donald Trump has warned that if Russian President Vladimir Putin tries to take control of all of Ukraine, it could lead to Russia’s downfall. In a post on Truth Social on Sunday night, Trump said, “I’ve always had a good relationship with Putin, but something has happened to him. He’s gone absolutely CRAZY!” Trump said he believes Putin wants to take over all of Ukraine, not just part of it, and warned that doing so would be a huge mistake for Russia, The Guardian reported. Earlier that day, Trump told reporters he was shocked by Russia’s latest attacks on Ukrainian cities. He also said he was now considering adding new sanctions on Russia. “He’s killing a lot of people,” Trump said. “What the hell happened to him?” Trump also took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying Zelenskyy was “doing his country no favors” and that “everything out of his mouth causes problems.” He added, “I don’t like it, and it better stop.” Zelenskyy had earlier criticised the US for not speaking out more strongly after Russia carried out its biggest air attack in years. The weekend strikes killed at least 12 people, including three children, and involved nearly 300 drones and dozens of missiles. Despite promising during his campaign to end the war in 24 hours, Trump has not placed new sanctions on Russia, even after it refused a proposed 30-day ceasefire. Zelenskyy’s top aide said more pressure is needed, warning that Russia could continue attacking not just Ukraine, but possibly other countries as well. Image source: File Trump shows wrong photo to claim white farmers are being killed in South Africa During a meeting at the White House with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, US President Donald Trump wrongly said he had proof that white farmers were being killed in South Africa. He held up a picture and said, “These are all white farmers being buried.” But the photo wasn’t from South Africa at all, it was taken in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It shows people being buried after a deadly attack by rebels near the city of Goma. The picture came from a video made by the news agency Reuters in February. Trump had seen the image in an article on a conservative website called American Thinker, which talked about race problems in both South Africa and the DRC. The website didn’t explain where the image was from, but it linked to the original video about Congo. The Reuters journalist who filmed the video, Djaffar Al Katanty, said he was shocked to see Trump using it in the wrong way. “President Trump used my video from Congo to claim white people are being killed in South Africa,” he said, TimesLive reported. The White House didn’t respond to questions about the mistake. The editor of the blog admitted Trump was wrong about the photo, but still defended the article’s message. President Ramaphosa visited the US this week to improve relations. Trump has accused South Africa of mistreating white people, which the South African government says is not true. Image source: File Ramaphosa jokes with Trump: ‘I don’t have a plane to give you’ South African President Cyril Ramaphosa met US President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday. The meeting had some tense moments, but Ramaphosa used humour to lighten things up. When a reporter asked Trump about a $400-million private jet he reportedly accepted from Qatar, Ramaphosa joked, “I don’t have a plane to give you.” Trump laughed and replied, “I wish you did. I would take it.” But the mood turned tense when the reporter asked if taking the plane was ethical. Trump got angry and said, “You’re a bad reporter. You should be ashamed,” and told the reporter they couldn’t ask any more questions. Ramaphosa tried to keep things calm by repeating his joke, which got another laugh. Earlier in the meeting, Trump showed Ramaphosa a video he claimed showed the graves of over 1,000 white farmers in South Africa and handed him newspaper articles. Ramaphosa, watching with no visible reaction, asked where the video came from and responded: “There is crime in South Africa, but most of the victims are Black.” Trump replied, “The farmers are not Black.” Later, when journalists asked how the meeting went, Ramaphosa said, “It went very well.” Image source: @PresidencyZA Trump drops Elon Musk as friendship falls apart Elon Musk is no longer part of the US government team he once helped lead, and it looks like he’s stepping away from politics completely. The tech billionaire has been removed from the Department of Government Efficiency (called DOGE), and many of his businesses have struggled because of his political opinions and ties to President Donald Trump. Trump used to praise Musk often on his Truth Social account, sometimes mentioning him four times a week. He liked Musk’s bold cost-cutting moves, including firing government workers and shutting down departments. But things have changed. Trump hasn’t mentioned Musk at all since early April, and reports say Musk’s influence in the White House is basically gone. One Republican insider told Politico, “He’s done. People don’t like him anymore.” They said Musk’s attempts to act like an average American didn’t go down well, and instead upset voters. Now, people in Trump’s team see Musk as a problem, not an asset. He used to be viewed as a smart outsider who could help fix government, but now he’s seen as too controversial. There hasn’t been an official announcement, but the silence from Trump’s side says a lot. According to The Independent, Trump’s team is quietly pulling away from Musk. Image source: File Ramaphosa lands in Washington for talks with Trump President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived in Washington DC for an important visit to the United States. He is expected to meet with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday. Ramaphosa is travelling with several senior government leaders and political figures, including Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen, Trade and Industry Minister Parks Tau, Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, International Relations Minister Ronald Lamola and South Africa’s new special envoy to the US, Mcebisi Jonas. In a statement earlier this week, Steenhuisen said the visit is both historic and crucial. He explained that his focus is on strengthening trade relations between the US and South Africa, especially in the agricultural sector. He said that maintaining agreements like AGOA is essential to protect jobs, boost the economy and create more employment opportunities. Steenhuisen added that South Africa’s relationship with the United States is extremely important. He warned that losing preferential trade access under AGOA would be a major blow to the country’s economy, especially for farmers and farm workers. The upcoming meeting between Ramaphosa and Trump is expected to address key economic and political issues affecting both nations. Image source: @PresidencyZA Trump to call Putin in push for Ukraine ceasefire US President Donald Trump says he’s ready to speak with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday in a new push to end the war in Ukraine. Trump shared on social media that he’s expecting a “productive day” and hopes to make progress toward a ceasefire. He also plans to speak with NATO leaders. The war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, has proved difficult to end, despite Trump’s repeated claims that he could stop it quickly. Trump’s top adviser on the matter, Steve Witkoff, said the president believes a phone call with Putin could “clear up the logjam” and get both sides closer to peace. “I think it’s going to be a very successful call,” Witkoff said. But not everyone agrees with Trump’s approach. Bridget Brink, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, resigned last month, saying the administration has been too soft on Russia and too hard on Ukraine. She said the final straw came in February, when Trump and his team criticised Zelenskyy during a meeting at the White House. “Peace at any price is not peace,” Brink warned. “It’s appeasement, and that leads to more war.” Trump said the first call will happen at 10am Monday with Putin. He hopes to stop what he called the “bloodbath” in Ukraine. He also suggested trade incentives might be part of the deal, since Russia’s economy is suffering under US and Western sanctions. Trump posted that he believes this war “should never have happened” and is confident it can be ended soon. Image source: File Ramaphosa and Trump to talk trade, refugees and war President Cyril Ramaphosa is heading to the United States next week to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on May 21. Their goal is to fix tensions between South Africa and the US. Relations between the two countries have gotten worse since Trump returned to office in January. Trump has cut off aid to South Africa and accused the government of unfairly targeting white Afrikaners through its land reform policies. He also allowed 49 white South Africans to move to the US as “refugees,” claiming they were victims of racial discrimination. South Africa says this is not true. Ramaphosa’s team says that the refugee issue is not the most important topic for the meeting. Instead, he wants to focus on trade, investment, and cooperation between the two countries. He will also speak to Trump about: South Africa says it wants fair trade, peaceful diplomacy, and a balanced relationship with the US. Ramaphosa has invited Trump to visit South Africa later this year for the G20 summit and says he’ll see for himself that the country is peaceful and welcoming. South African officials say they expect the meeting to be respectful, even if the two leaders don’t agree on everything. Image source: File Ramaphosa to meet Trump in the US next week President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit the United States next week to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on May 21, his office confirmed on Wednesday. The two leaders will talk about important issues between South Africa and the US, as well as topics affecting the rest of Africa and the world. Ramaphosa’s office says the visit is a chance to improve relations between the two countries, which have become strained since Trump returned to power in January. Trump has cut off all US aid to South Africa, saying he doesn’t support the country’s land reform plans or its legal case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. This week, the US also gave refugee status to 49 white South Africans, claiming they face racial discrimination. The South African government says that claim is not true, and Ramaphosa has said the US is misunderstanding the situation. Even though relations are tense, the US is still one of South Africa’s biggest trading partners, after China. Image source: File Saudi Arabia rolls out mobile McDonald’s for Trump US President Donald Trump was given a tasty surprise during his trip to Saudi Arabia this week, a mobile McDonald’s restaurant set up just for him. Trump landed in Riyadh on Tuesday to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The two leaders signed several major deals, including a $142 billion arms agreement involving US defence companies. But all eyes were on something else parked nearby, a fully equipped McDonald’s on wheels, brought in especially for Trump’s visit, Daily Star reported. The restaurant served the usual favourites like Big Macs and Quarter Pounders, as well as local menu items like the McArabia Kofta, which is served in pita bread. Trump has long been open about his love for fast food. He once ordered 300 burgers to the White House, posed for photos serving food at McDonald’s during his campaign, and starred in a McDonald’s commercial years ago. After attending a funeral in New York last year, he even ordered $200 worth of burgers for his flight home to Florida. Trump once said he prefers McDonald’s because it’s “clean” and he trusts that the food is safely pre-made. According to his biographer, he likes it because he fears being poisoned, and believes McDonald’s food is safer than unknown restaurants. Trump is expected to attend more events in Saudi Arabia before continuing his Middle East tour in Qatar, where reports suggest he may be given a £302 million private jet as a gift from Qatari royals. Image source: @stockbella Trump invites all South African minorities to apply to be refugees The US is now offering asylum to all South African minorities, including Afrikaners, who say they are being mistreated or fear they may be in danger. The US embassy in South Africa announced that people who are Afrikaner or part of a racial minority group in South Africa can now apply to move to the US as refugees. The programme is part of a new order signed by President Donald Trump. To apply, you must: Applicants must complete a form and explain their situation, including how many people are travelling with them and when they’re ready to leave. They’ll be asked what kind of harm they’ve faced, such as unfair treatment because of race, religion, or political views. The first group of people from South Africa has already flown to the US. But in the US, many people are asking why South Africans are being fast-tracked, while thousands of other refugees from war zones, already been approved, are still being blocked. Some lawyers say it’s unfair and may break US law, especially since Trump had earlier stopped refugee resettlement completely. Now, his administration is helping some people while leaving others in danger. A US refugee group said: “Afrikaners are being fast-tracked, while others in desperate need are left behind.” Image source: File Ukraine and Russia may agree to peace talks this week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says there could be a ceasefire with Russia as soon as Monday, with direct peace talks possibly happening later this week in Turkey. Zelenskyy shared the news on social media after speaking directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said both sides may meet in person on Thursday in Istanbul. “We’re waiting for a full and lasting ceasefire starting tomorrow,” Zelenskyy said. “There’s no reason to keep the killing going.” Russia and Ukraine have been at war since 2022. This is the most hopeful update in months. Putin has rejected Ukraine’s call for a 30-day unconditional truce but has offered face-to-face talks without preconditions. Donald Trump, who pushed Zelenskyy to accept the offer, posted: “Have the meeting, now!” European leaders, from France, Germany, the UK and Poland, met with Zelenskyy on Saturday and also demanded a ceasefire starting Monday. They warned Russia of tougher sanctions if Putin doesn’t agree. Putin says he wants peace, but only if it leads to a “lasting solution” and not just time for Ukraine to prepare for more fighting. While the US and European countries see this week’s talks as a chance for peace, many remain sceptical of Putin’s intentions. “This could be a first step,” said French President Emmanuel Macron, “but it’s not enough.” If talks go ahead on Thursday, it would be the most serious chance yet to end the war. Image source: File Trump says having an American pope is a ‘great honour’ The new head of the Catholic Church is Robert Francis Prevost, who will now be known as Pope Leo XIV. He was born in Chicago, studied near Philadelphia, and later worked as a missionary in Peru. Trump praised the historic appointment, telling reporters: “To have the Pope from America is a great honour.” Other American leaders also welcomed the news. Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, said millions will pray for the new pope, BBC reported. Joe Biden, a devout Catholic and former president, wrote: “Habemus papam – May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois.” Barack Obama congratulated the pope as a fellow Chicagoan, calling it a historic day. George Bush said the news brought “hope” for Catholics in America and around the world. While many political leaders are celebrating, there are signs that Pope Leo may have disagreed with some of Trump’s past policies. A social media account believed to be his once shared posts criticising the Trump administration’s deportations and comments made by JD Vance. The Vatican has not confirmed whether the account belongs to Pope Leo. Image source: @CyrilRamaphosa Iran wants to kill Trump to get revenge, says ex-us official Iran is planning to kill Donald Trump to get revenge for the killing of one of their top generals, says John Bolton, a former US security adviser. In 2020, Trump ordered a US airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani, a powerful Iranian military leader, in Iraq. Since then, Iran has promised to strike back. Now, Bolton says Iran has made a kill list, and Trump is number one on it. Bolton also believes he is on the list. “Iran is using gangs in Europe and the US to go after people who speak out against them,” Bolton told Sky News. “They’re trying to find and hurt people like me — and Trump is their main target.” Trump was already the target of an assassination attempt last year in the US. At the same time, Trump says his government is now talking directly with Iran to try and stop them from building a nuclear bomb. “We’re having talks. A deal would be better than the alternative,” Trump said. “But if the talks fail, Iran will be in big trouble.” Iran has not said anything yet about Bolton’s claims, but its leaders have often warned the US would pay for killing Soleimani. Image source: File Trump says letting Russia back into the World Cup might help end the war Donald Trump was surprised to learn that Russia is banned from the 2026 Fifa World Cup because of its invasion of Ukraine. When a journalist asked him about Russia’s suspension during a White House Fifa meeting, Trump said, “I didn’t know that. Is that right?” Fifa president Gianni Infantino quickly explained that Russia is currently banned from international football. “We hope peace will come and they can be readmitted,” he said. Trump then suggested that allowing Russia back into the tournament could be used as a peace incentive. “Hey, that could be a good incentive, right?” he said. “We want them to stop. We want the killing to stop. It’s not even believable.” Trump also claimed that hosting the 2026 World Cup, which will take place across the US, Canada, and Mexico, would bring massive economic benefits. He said it would create thousands of jobs and bring in billions for local businesses. “We’ll make sure it’s safe and successful,” Trump promised. “Everyone coming to the US will have a smooth, easy experience.” The US is also set to host the Club World Cup this June. Trump said both tournaments will be “special” and the 2026 World Cup will be “the best run soccer tournament the world has ever seen.” Image source: White House Trump will pay undocumented immigrants $1,000 to leave the US The Trump administration has announced a new program that will pay undocumented immigrants $1,000 (R18,000) if they agree to leave the US voluntarily. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says people without legal status can apply through an app called CBP Home. After they leave the country and it’s confirmed, they’ll get the money. This is a change to an app created under President Biden, which helped people request asylum at the US border. Trump shut that down and changed it so the app now helps people exit the US instead. DHS says this approach saves money. Right now, arresting and deporting someone costs the US over $17,000. By offering a $1,000 incentive, the government says it could cut those costs by 70%. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said it’s the “safest and most cost-effective way to leave” and avoid arrest, the Guardian reported. One person has already flown back to Honduras under the program, and more trips are planned. The government claims people who leave this way might have a better chance of being allowed back legally later, but immigration experts warn that this may be false hope. Critics say it’s a trap and could actually make it harder for people to return legally in the future. This plan is part of Trump’s larger push to reduce immigration and encourage “self-deportation”, which means making life in the US so difficult that people decide to leave on their own. Image source: File Trump announces 100% tariff on movies made outside the US President Donald Trump says all movies made outside of the United States will now face a 100% import tax. He made the announcement on his Truth Social account on Sunday, calling foreign-made films a “national security threat.” Trump says countries like Australia and New Zealand are stealing away American film jobs by offering better deals to Hollywood producers. He wants movies to be made in the US again, the Guardian reported. “We want movies made in America, again!” he posted. He also claimed the move is needed to fight “messaging and propaganda” from other countries. It’s not yet clear how or when the new tax will begin, or whether it affects American companies filming overseas. Film production in Los Angeles has dropped nearly 40% over the past 10 years, according to FilmLA. Meanwhile, countries like Australia, New Zealand and others have attracted big-budget movies by offering tax breaks and cash. Image source: File Trump asks for ‘divine dreams’ and makes virgin joke at prayer event Donald Trump held a big prayer event at the White House on Thursday, where religious leaders asked God to give him “divine dreams” and protect him with “supernatural power.” One man even knelt in front of Trump while others raised their hands and sang Amazing Grace. The event marked National Prayer Day, and Trump used the moment to sign a new order creating a group called the Religious Liberty Commission. Trump, who survived an assassination attempt last year, said he believes God saved his life and is now helping guide his leadership. “We’re bringing back religion in this country,” Trump said. Paula White, Trump’s spiritual adviser, led the prayers. She asked God to give him special dreams, wisdom, and strength. She also said the country needs a spiritual reset, with Trump leading the way. Even though Trump has faced many scandals, including a criminal conviction and selling $60 Bibles, many Christian voters still support him. During the event, Trump also made a joke about a belief that saints in Islam receive 72 virgins in Heaven. “What about 38 virgins?” he joked while speaking about a talk he had with Muslim leaders. “They said, ‘That’s nonsense.’” Trump repeated his false claim that he won the 2020 election and said he’s working to protect religion in America, including setting up a team to fight “anti-Christian bias.” One top advisor, Mike Waltz, was missing. Trump later replaced him due to a scandal over leaked messages. Image source: White House Trump jokes about becoming the next pope Donald Trump this week told reporters that he wants to be the next pope. “I’d like to be pope,” Trump said with a grin. “That would be my number one choice.” Users on social media site X quickly made fun of the comment, with one writing, “First time in history, we will have orange pope.” Others pointed out how the media might have reacted if someone else had said it: “Had Biden said something this stupid, the media and MAGA would have a field day,” Daily Star reported. Trump didn’t name a preferred candidate for the real role, but did mention Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, calling him “very good”. The College of Cardinals is set to meet on May 7 to start voting for the next pope after Pope Francis’s funeral on Saturday. Only cardinals under the age of 80 can vote, and 108 of the 135 eligible voters were appointed by Francis. While some cardinals want to continue Francis’s focus on helping the poor and vulnerable, others are pushing for a return to traditional teachings and unity in the church. Trump’s pope comment may have been a joke, but the conclave to choose the real one is expected to be serious, and fast, possibly wrapped up in two or three days. Image source: File Trump moves fast but big promises still not done Donald Trump has been moving fast since returning to the White House. After 100 days, he’s made some big changes, but many of his promises are still not done. Trump says he already fixed inflation, but experts warn that his high tariffs on foreign goods could make prices rise again. He promised to lower energy bills by half, but for now, energy costs have stayed the same. On immigration, Trump has made a big impact. Illegal crossings from Mexico have dropped a lot, and deportations are up. Trump promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war quickly. That hasn’t happened. Fighting is still going on, and there is no peace deal yet. He also promised big tax cuts, like no taxes on tips and overtime pay, but none of those have passed yet. Trump has acted fast on cultural issues. He banned transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports, cut funding to some universities, and pardoned around 1,500 people who were involved in the January 6 Capitol riot. Trump also worked with Elon Musk to cut government jobs, but the savings are much smaller than they promised. In short, Trump has moved quickly on immigration and culture wars, but promises like cheaper energy, lower taxes, and peace in Ukraine are still not delivered, and it’s unclear if they will be. Image source: File Trump says Ukraine may give Russia part of its land US President Donald Trump says he thinks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ready to give up Crimea to Russia, even though Zelenskyy said just last week that Crimea will always belong to Ukraine. Speaking to reporters in New Jersey on Sunday, Trump said: “Oh, I think so,” when asked if Zelenskyy was willing to give up the Black Sea region, which Russia seized in 2014, the Guardian reported. Zelenskyy has not yet responded to Trump’s latest comments. But last week, he clearly stated that Crimea is still “the property of the Ukrainian people.” Meanwhile, leaked US peace plans suggest Trump’s team is proposing that Russia keep the territories it captured, including Crimea. Germany’s defence minister called the US plan a “capitulation” and warned it was worse than anything Ukraine could have agreed to a year ago. Even so, Trump said after meeting Zelenskyy at the Vatican that he now has more sympathy for him. “He’s working hard. He wants to do something good for his country.” Trump also criticised Russia for launching new missile attacks after his peace ambassador met with Putin, saying he was “very disappointed.” When asked if he trusts Putin, Trump answered: “I’ll let you know in about two weeks.” Trump added that he believes a peace deal could be signed soon and claimed (without evidence) that the US has already sent Ukraine $350 billion in aid. On another front, Trump said there had been “a little bit” of progress in trade talks with China, despite Chinese officials saying no talks are happening. Image source: Donald Trump Truth Social Trump starts 2028 campaign even though third term is not allowed Donald Trump has started selling “Trump 2028” campaign hats, even though US law says he can’t run for a third term. The red cap, which looks like his usual “Make America Great Again” hat, now says “Trump 2028” and is being sold for $50 (around R1,000). According to the US Constitution, a person can only be elected president twice. Trump already won in 2016 and again in 2024, which means he shouldn’t be able to run again. But Trump told NBC that there may be “ways around” the rule. “I’m not joking,” he said. “A lot of people want me to do it.” Former Republican politician Adam Kinzinger says Trump is ignoring the rules and could create a big crisis if he refuses to listen to court decisions in the future, Daily Star reported. Trump’s second time in the White House has already caused economic problems, with high tariffs on imports and growing tension between countries. Stock markets have dropped, and trade wars have begun. Now, there are signs that Trump might try to calm things down but many believe the chaos isn’t over yet. Trump’s actions can affect the whole world, including South Africa. If he tries to stay in power longer than allowed, it could damage trust in democracy everywhere and hurt global trade and economic stability. Image source: File Trump still cares about Africa, says adviser after aid cuts US President Donald Trump still cares about Africa, even after cutting major aid programmes and raising tariffs, according to his adviser Massad Boulos. In an interview with the BBC, Boulos said Trump “highly values Africa and African people” and denied that the US is planning to close its embassies across the continent. But Trump’s actions have caused real problems. On his first day in office, Trump froze most US foreign aid, which has had a serious impact on health services in Africa. Many HIV treatment programmes were cut, and some countries may soon run out of HIV medication, according to the World Health Organization. Kenya, Nigeria and Lesotho are among the countries affected. The aid freeze also hit cholera clinics. In South Sudan, five children and three adults died after walking for hours to reach a clinic that had shut down. Boulos said the US is reviewing how aid is spent to make sure the money is not being wasted. “We want the money to go to the right places,” he said. He also confirmed that the US is interested in mining resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, especially minerals like lithium, which are used in electric car batteries. Trump’s trade policies have also hit Africa. He recently placed 50% tariffs on imports from countries like Lesotho, before putting those tariffs on hold for 90 days. Lesotho depends on US trade, especially in clothing and textiles. There are also worries about the future of AGOA — a special trade agreement between the US and African countries, first launched in 2000. Trump has not said if he will renew it, and experts think it might end soon. Image source: File Trump says China tariffs will drop but not go away US President Donald Trump says his very high tariffs on goods from China will be reduced but not removed completely. Right now, the US charges a 145% tariff on Chinese goods. China hit back with a 125% tariff on US products. This has started a trade war that’s shaken the global economy. Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said: “The tariffs will come down a lot — but they won’t go to zero,” the Guardian reported. His comments followed a warning from his treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who said the current situation can’t continue and both sides need to make changes. Trump said he still wants to keep good relations with China: “We’re doing fine with China. I think we’ll work well together.” The stock market went up after news of possible lower tariffs. China hasn’t officially replied yet, but their media called Trump’s tariffs unfair and warned other countries not to make trade deals that hurt China. Meanwhile, businesses around the world, including in South Africa, are worried that this trade fight will make things more expensive and slow down the economy. Both China and the US are huge trading partners for South Africa. If their trade war continues, it could mean fewer exports, job losses, and higher prices here at home. Image source: File Pope once told Trump ‘he’s not a Christian’ Pope Francis and Donald Trump never had a good relationship, and it all started with a wall. During Trump’s 2016 campaign, the Pope slammed his plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico, saying: “A person who thinks only about building walls and not bridges is not Christian.” Trump didn’t take it well. He fired back, saying if ISIS ever attacked the Vatican, the Pope would’ve prayed for a president like him, Daily Star reported. The two later met in 2017 at the Vatican. Trump said it was a “fantastic meeting,” but photos told a different story, with the Pope looking miserable next to Trump’s big grin. Things didn’t get better. This year, just months before his death, the Pope again criticised Trump’s mass deportation policies, saying they were built on “force, not dignity” and “will end badly.” He also disagreed with Vice President JD Vance, who said people should look after their own families and countries before helping others. The Pope wrote: “Christian love is not just about looking after people close to you.” Pope Francis passed away on Monday 21 April at the age of 88. Trump is expected to attend his funeral on Saturday. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump says Russia and Ukraine might make a peace deal soon US President Donald Trump says Russia and Ukraine could reach a peace deal “this week”, but gave no details on what that would look like. Writing in all caps on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday, 20 April, Trump said: “HOPEFULLY RUSSIA AND UKRAINE WILL MAKE A DEAL THIS WEEK.” He added that if peace is reached, both countries could start doing “big business” with the US and “make a fortune.” The comment comes after a failed Easter ceasefire between the two countries. Russia said it would pause attacks for the holiday, but both sides have since accused each other of breaking the truce. Trump has recently said that both Ukraine and Russia need to compromise to end the war, which started in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Any peace deal between Russia and Ukraine would affect global prices, from fuel to food. It could ease inflation and reduce pressure on SA’s economy, which has been hit hard by rising costs linked to the war. Image source: File Presidency says Trump won’t hold grudge against Jonas The presidency has defended sending Mcebisi Jonas to the US as South Africa’s new special envoy despite an old video where Jonas called Donald Trump a “racist, homophobe and narcissist”. The comments were made in 2020, when Jonas gave a public lecture as a private citizen, not as a government official. Presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said on Wednesday: “At the time, Jonas was not representing the government. Those views were personal.” He added that Trump isn’t the type to hold grudges. “If he did, half his cabinet wouldn’t be working with him.” Jonas’ job is to fix SA’s diplomatic and trade relationship with the US, which has become tense. Trump expelled SA’s former ambassador Ebrahim Rasool after criticism of his administration, and recently threatened to boycott the G20 summit in South Africa. Magwenya said Rasool and Jonas are different cases — Rasool spoke while in office, while Jonas was just an activist at the time. Jonas also commented this week, saying: “These things happen. People move on.” Image source: File Trump’s trade war with China is bad news for South Africa South Africa got a 90-day break from Trump’s harsh tariffs, but experts say we’re still in trouble. That’s because Trump is now hitting China, one of South Africa’s biggest trading partners — with heavy taxes. And when China’s economy slows down, South Africa suffers too. China and the US buy over 18% of SA’s exports. If demand drops, it means fewer sales, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy here at home. Economist Maarten Ackerman told Mail & Guardian: “Even if the US doesn’t tax us directly, we’re still going to feel the pain.” SA’s farmers and food producers may need to find new markets fast, especially if US buyers stop ordering wine, fruit, or canned goods. To protect trade ties, President Ramaphosa has sent Mcebisi Jonas to Washington as a special envoy to deal with the growing crisis. Image source: File Trump blames Zelenskyy for war after deadly Russian attack Just days after 35 people were killed in Ukraine by Russian missiles — including two children — US President Donald Trump blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for helping to start the war. Speaking from the White House, Trump said that millions of people have died because of three people: Russia’s Vladimir Putin, former US president Joe Biden, and Zelenskyy. He said the war could have been stopped: “Biden could’ve stopped it, Zelenskyy could’ve stopped it, and Putin should never have started it,” Trump told reporters, Sky News reported. He also said Ukraine made a mistake by going to war with a much stronger country: “You don’t start a war with someone 20 times your size and hope people give you missiles,” he said. The comments came just after two Russian missiles hit the city of Sumy during a Palm Sunday celebration. It was one of the deadliest attacks in Ukraine this year, and over 100 people were injured. Zelenskyy has called for help from the world. Russia claimed it hit a military target but has shown no proof. Trump said he wants to end the war and stop people from dying: “All I want to do is stop the killing.” Image source: File White House claims Trump is healthy and fit to lead Donald Trump is “fully fit” to run the United States, even though he has high cholesterol, slightly high blood pressure, and a scar from a gunshot, according to a report from the White House doctor. The report came after Trump, who is 78 years old, went for his yearly health check-up. The doctor, Sean Barbella, said Trump is in good shape, both physically and mentally, and is taking medicine to manage his cholesterol. Trump’s cholesterol level is now 140, which is healthy. In 2018, it was over 220. His blood pressure is a little high at 128 over 74, but it’s not dangerous. The report also said Trump is up to date on all his vaccines, even though his health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has questioned vaccines in the past. Trump still has a scar on his ear from when he was shot at during a campaign rally last year. He survived, but one person died and others were injured. Trump told reporters after the exam: “I think it went well. They did every test you can imagine.” He also said he took a cognitive test to check his memory and thinking skills. He scored 30 out of 30, which means he passed with full marks. The test includes tasks like drawing a clock, remembering words, and naming animals. His heart rate was 62 beats per minute, which is normal for someone in good health. Image source: White House Tariff pause is no relief for South Africa South Africa has been given a 90-day break from Donald Trump’s harsh import tariffs but experts say it’s not really good news. The US dropped tariffs on many SA goods from 31% down to 10%, giving local exporters a bit of breathing room. But analysts and unions say this is just a tactic by Trump’s administration to force South Africa into signing trade deals that favour the US. Trade Minister Parks Tau confirmed that SA is included in the pause and said talks have already begun. But some tariffs, like the 25% tax on cars, steel, and aluminium, are still in place. Experts say the US is using tariffs as a negotiating weapon. Dr Frederich Kirsten, an economist, said: “It’s not about relief — it’s about pressure. The US now holds the cards,” he told The Citizen. Political analyst Sandile Swana warned that the US is trying to change global trade rules. “When you trade with the US, they want your country to play by American rules — even if it hurts your economy,” he said. Unions are worried too. Cosatu says 500,000 jobs in South Africa are linked to trade with the US. They called the 10% tax on agriculture “still too high” and warned that keeping cars at a 25% tariff could kill exports and cause job losses. The US tariff pause isn’t a gift — it’s a way to pressure SA into making deals that could hurt workers, weaken trade rules, and threaten jobs. With unemployment at around 32%, SA can’t afford to play along without a fight. Image source: File Lesotho made Trump’s shirts — now he’s taxing them 50% Some of Donald Trump’s fancy golf shirts were made in Lesotho, the same country he just hit with a huge 50% tariff. Trump’s branded shirts, made by golf legend Greg Norman’s clothing brand, have tags showing they were made in Lesotho. But now, because of Trump’s new import rules, clothing from Lesotho will cost 50% more to bring into the US. That’s bad news for Lesotho. The country depends on selling clothes to the US — it’s one of the biggest parts of its economy and supports 15,000 jobs, News24 reported. Before this, Lesotho’s clothes went into the US tariff-free under a deal called AGOA, which helps African countries trade with America. But that benefit is now gone. The reason? Trump says Lesotho has a trade “imbalance” with the US, mostly because of diamond sales. Greg Norman, who makes the shirts and supports Trump, once called him “a breath of fresh air.” Now, that air comes with a big bill. Lesotho’s economy is closely tied to South Africa. If thousands of jobs are lost there, it can affect trade, migration, and our shared economy. And if Trump is raising tariffs on neighbours like Lesotho, South Africa could face even more pressure — we’ve already been hit with a 30% tariff. Image source: File Trump’s tan taxed as tariff war hits his face Donald Trump’s new import taxes could end up hitting his own face — as prices rise on tanning products used to create his famous orange glow. Trump’s massive new tariffs came into effect on April 5, adding tariffs to thousands of foreign products. And that includes fake tan. Popular UK bronzer brand St. Tropez will now cost Americans 10% more, while Trump’s rumoured favourite face cream — Swiss brand Bronx Colors — will be hit with a 31% tariff. That means the president’s signature orange look could soon come with a higher price tag, Daily Star reported. Trump reportedly insists on 2 bottles of the Swiss concealer in his bedroom at all times. But now, thanks to his own tariffs, Americans will be paying more for beauty products, food, clothes, and electronics. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump wants to ban sex toys and bring back child labour Donald Trump is trying to make it harder to buy sex toys — and easier for kids to work overnight. In Texas, a new law would force people to show their ID just to buy a vibrator online. Sellers who don’t check could face a year in jail and a $4,000 fine. Another proposed law would ban big shops like Walmart from selling sex toys at all — only strip clubs and sex shops would be allowed to sell them. The official term for a sex toy in Texas? An “obscene device” — including dildos and anything used to “stimulate genitals.” Sex expert Dr. Shamyra Howard said, “It turns something normal and healthy into something shameful.” Meanwhile, in Florida, lawmakers want to let 14-year-olds work night shifts, even on school days. One journalist put it simply: “Orgasms are out. Child labour is back.” Image source: File Zimbabwe cuts US tariffs as Africa faces trade war Zimbabwe’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, says his country will drop all tariffs on goods coming from the US — just days after Donald Trump slapped an 18% tariff on Zimbabwe’s exports going into America. Mnangagwa says he wants to improve relations with the US and hopes this move will open the door to better trade. But many people say it’s a bad deal. Top journalist Hopewell Chin’ono says Zimbabwe is trying to “please” Trump in the hopes that US sanctions on Mnangagwa will be removed — but he calls it “a long shot.” Zimbabwe has been under some form of US sanctions for over 20 years, mainly due to human rights abuses and corruption. Biden removed the old sanctions last year but kept targeted sanctions on 11 people, including Mnangagwa himself. Now, Zimbabwe says it wants fair trade and friendly relations. But critics say the US will benefit far more from this decision than Zimbabwe will. Trade between the two countries is small — just over $110 million in 2024 — and most experts say scrapping tariffs won’t help Zimbabwe much. Mnangagwa, who is currently the chair of the SADC region, is also being criticised for acting alone. Some say he should be working with other African countries to respond to Trump as a group, not going solo. Trump has placed huge tariffs across Africa: Lesotho says it will send a team to the US to negotiate. Trump’s new tariffs are already hitting South Africa hard, with a 30% tax on goods going into the US. That could hurt our exports, lead to job losses, and make our economy even more unstable. And if other African countries start making one-sided deals, SA could be left behind. Image source: @edmnangagwa Donald Trump calls America a ‘healing patient’ Donald Trump says America is like a patient that just had surgery — and now it’s getting better, thanks to his new trade rules. On what he’s calling “Liberation Day”, Trump signed off on a big new tax (called a tariff) on goods coming into the US from other countries, including the UK, Japan, South Korea and South Africa. For example, goods from South Africa will now face a 30% tariff when they enter America. Even though many Americans are worried about prices going up, Trump celebrated on social media, writing: “THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING. THE PATIENT WILL BE STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER.” But not everyone is impressed. The UK government says it won’t react just yet, and Japan is deciding whether to fight back with its own tariffs. Experts also pointed out that some of Trump’s claims in his speech were wrong — like when he said American companies aren’t allowed to sell cars in other countries. To make things more awkward, Trump walked off the stage after his speech before signing the actual papers. A staff member had to bring him back to finish the job. When big countries like the US start taxing imports, it can cause global prices to rise. That means we might end up paying more here in South Africa for fuel, food, cars and other goods. Image source: File Elon Musk expected to leave Trump’s government soon Elon Musk is expected to leave his role in Donald Trump’s government in the next few weeks, according to insiders. Musk has been working as a special advisor in Trump’s new department called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But now, with Tesla sales dropping and more people criticising his influence in politics, Musk is stepping back to focus on his businesses. His time as a “special government employee” is set to end around May or June. At a press briefing, Trump said: “At some point, he’s going back. I’d keep him as long as I can — he’s very smart.” But behind the scenes, there’s been trouble. Some people in Trump’s team say Musk’s behaviour has become difficult to manage. His surprise announcements and posts on social media have caused problems, and many in the White House have been frustrated. Musk has also become a political problem. He recently spent millions supporting a judge in an American election — but the judge lost badly. His link to Trump is also hurting Tesla, as some customers are now avoiding the brand. Tesla’s share price has dropped, and some experts say Musk is turning people away with his behaviour. Trump has also started to distance himself from DOGE, the government project Musk created to “cut waste.” Some say it caused more confusion than results. Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, and he’s one of the most powerful people in the world. His role in the US government affects decisions about technology, business, and even space. If Musk steps away from politics, it could change how the US works with other countries — including South Africa. Image source: @POTUS Trump to announce new taxes on imports Donald Trump is set to make a big announcement on Wednesday that could affect prices around the world — including in South Africa. He’s calling it “Liberation Day”, and he plans to add new taxes (called tariffs) on goods coming into the United States from other countries. That means anything the US buys from overseas — like cars, clothes, electronics, oil, and food — could be taxed more. Trump says he’s doing this to protect American businesses and workers, and to punish countries he thinks have taken advantage of the US for years. Reports say Trump may add: These new tariffs would start right away — and many people are worried. Business leaders in the US say the extra taxes will make things more expensive for them, and they’ll likely raise prices for customers to make up for it. That could lead to a rise in the cost of living in many countries. The global stock market has already dropped, and experts say Trump’s plan could help cause a worldwide recession — which means job losses, rising prices, and slower trade. If prices go up in the US and Europe, South Africans could feel it too. We might pay more for things we import, like petrol, electronics and food. If global trade slows down, South African businesses could lose money — and that puts jobs at risk. Image source: File Trump says he’s not joking about a third term as president Donald Trump has suggested he could try to stay in the White House for a third term, despite the US Constitution saying that’s not allowed. Speaking in an interview, the 78-year-old president said “a lot of people want me to do it,” and hinted that his vice president JD Vance could take over as president — and then step down so Trump could return. “I’m not joking,” Trump said. “There are ways you could do it.” Under US law, no president can be elected more than twice. But Trump’s latest comments have experts worried. Former congressman David Jolly warned: “If he says he’s not ruling it out, we should take it seriously.” Legal experts say it’s likely just political theatre — but with Trump, anything is possible. If Trump starts a trade war, it could make everyday things more expensive here in South Africa. Our economy is connected to the global market, so if prices go up in the US and Europe, we feel it too. And if Trump finds a way to stay in power longer than the law allows, it could encourage other world leaders to try the same — which is bad news for democracy everywhere. Image source: @POTUS ‘Pissed off’ Trump warns Putin to back off or face tariffs Donald Trump says he’s “very angry” and “pissed off” with Russian president Vladimir Putin and now he’s threatening major new oil tariffs to force a peace deal in Ukraine. The outburst came after Putin suggested Ukraine should kick out president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of a ceasefire agreement — something Trump called a “step in the wrong direction.” Speaking to NBC News, Trump said: “If Russia and I can’t make a deal to stop the bloodshed, and I think it’s Russia’s fault — which it might be — I’ll hit them with massive tariffs. No more Russian oil in the US. No business with countries that buy it. A 25 to 50% tariff.” Trump has shifted from his previously soft tone on Putin to something more aggressive, even though he insists they still have a “good relationship.” His latest comments come as peace talks drag on with no clear end in sight. Russia says negotiations could stretch into 2026 and continues to demand the lifting of sanctions as a condition for any ceasefire. Meanwhile, Russia continues to bomb Ukrainian cities. A drone strike on Kharkiv this weekend killed two people and injured 35, including patients in a military hospital. A wider or longer war in Ukraine keeps global fuel prices high, food costs rising, and world markets unstable. If Trump gets tough on Russia, it could shake up oil supplies — and the impact will reach South African wallets fast. Image source: File Trump calls himself the fertilisation president Donald Trump has given himself a strange new nickname: “the fertilisation president.” He was speaking at the White House during a Women’s History Month event when he started talking about helping more women access IVF (in vitro fertilisation) — a medical process that helps people have babies. “There will be tremendous goodies in the bag for women,” Trump said. Then he added: “I’ll be known as the fertilisation president — and that’s OK.” People in the room laughed, and Trump smiled: “Actually, I like it. I’ve been called worse.” Trump has been trying to win over more women voters by promising that the government will help pay for fertility treatments. He also made headlines earlier this year when he called himself “the father of IVF,” even though he admitted he didn’t know much about it until recently. Image source: File Trump picks far-right media boss as new US ambassador to SA US President Donald Trump has nominated Brent Bozell — a hardcore conservative media figure — as America’s new ambassador to South Africa. Bozell is best known for founding the Media Research Center, a group that attacks what it calls “liberal bias” in the US media. Trump made the announcement on his social media account, calling Bozell “fearless” and praising his “extraordinary experience.” “Brent brings fearless tenacity, extraordinary experience, and vast knowledge to a Nation that desperately needs it,” Trump wrote. “Congratulations Brent!” Bozell could replace Reuben Brigety, who resigned in January after several rocky months in Pretoria. His nomination was confirmed this week in a formal note sent to the US Senate. This comes as relations between the US and South Africa remain tense, with Trump cutting funding and booting SA’s ambassador Ebrahim Rasool out of Washington earlier this month. Bozell is a known Trump loyalist who’s been part of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement. Some insiders say this appointment is less about diplomacy — and more about messaging. Brent Bozell is not a diplomat — he’s a political activist who supports Trump’s views and often attacks anyone who disagrees. His appointment means the US may take a tougher, more aggressive approach toward South Africa. That could make it harder for our government to work with the US on things like trade, diplomacy, and international issues like Ukraine or Gaza. Image source: @SenMikeLee Heavyweight clash at White House ends with missing belt Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed this week that he doesn’t know what happened to the WBC championship belt he brought to the White House months ago as a gift for Donald Trump. The belt, given to him by heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk after beating Tyson Fury, was meant as a peace offering. But instead of handing it over, Zelenskyy pulled out a folder of disturbing war photos showing tortured Ukrainian soldiers — and the meeting turned into a political punch-up. Trump, who had already called Zelenskyy a dictator, exploded on camera. “You’re gambling with World War III,” he snapped. Zelenskyy now says he left the belt on a side table and never saw it again. “Maybe it’s still sitting there,” he told Time magazine this week. Reports say a staffer moved it to Trump’s private dining room — where it may now be collecting dust next to tomato sauce bottles and golf trophies. Zelenskyy says he doesn’t regret showing the photos instead of the belt. “He has kids. He should feel what we feel,” he said. “But yeah… the conversation went in a different direction.” Image source: File Trump’s team accidentally texts war plans to journalist Top Trump officials have accidentally leaked secret US war plans in a messaging app group chat — by including a journalist in the conversation. The group, made up of senior figures like Vice President JD Vance, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, was discussing attacks on Yemen when they mistakenly added Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg. Goldberg says he was shocked to see real-time details of the military operation, including names of officials and sensitive tactics. “I thought it was a prank,” he said. “But the attack happened exactly as they planned it.” The Trump administration has confirmed the breach but is trying to downplay the damage. Hegseth even told reporters, “Nobody was texting war plans.” Goldberg hit back: “That’s a lie. He was.” If Trump’s top officials can’t keep their own war plans private, it puts global security at risk. Countries like South Africa often work with the US on trade, security, and international cooperation. But if the US keeps making mistakes like this, it’s harder to trust them. Image source: @POTUS Rasool says ‘don’t replace me with a white ambassador’ Former ambassador Ebrahim Rasool has told President Cyril Ramaphosa not to choose a white replacement just to please Donald Trump. Speaking at a homecoming rally in Cape Town on Sunday, Rasool told ANC supporters that South Africa must fix its relationship with the US but without sacrificing its values. “We can’t think that just because America has a white president, we need a white ambassador,” he said. “We need someone who can rebuild ties, but still stand strong for what we believe in.” Rasool was kicked out of the US last week after Trump’s government accused him of being disrespectful. Now, names like deputy minister Andries Nel and former DA leader Tony Leon are being floated as possible replacements but the presidency says there’s no rush. Rasool also called for a new kind of diplomacy — one based on Ubuntu. “Ubuntu diplomacy is not about lying to protect your country or flattering your host,” he said. “It’s about telling the truth with respect, standing your ground, and keeping your dignity.” The next ambassador will shape how South Africa navigates a tough relationship with Trump’s US. That choice will say a lot about whether we stand firm — or bend under pressure. Image source: File France wants the Statue of Liberty back French leaders are demanding that the United States give back the Statue of Liberty — all because of Donald Trump. French politician Raphaël Glucksmann says the statue, which was gifted to the US 140 years ago, no longer belongs there. He says Trump has “sided with tyrants” and no longer represents the values the statue stands for. “We gave it to you as a symbol of freedom,” Glucksmann said. “But if you’ve chosen to support dictators and silence scientists, then we want our gift back.” The Trump administration hit back hard, saying the statue is going nowhere. A White House spokesperson said France should be grateful to the US for helping them win World War II and added that “if it wasn’t for America, they’d be speaking German.” Even Australia’s former Prime Minister jumped in, reminding everyone that France once helped America fight the British in its own war for independence. This may sound like political theatre but it shows how Trump’s actions are damaging US relationships around the world. As America isolates itself, smaller countries like South Africa feel the knock-on effects in trade, global funding, and foreign policy influence. Image source: File Trump says Rasool must leave the US by Friday South Africa’s ambassador to the US, Ebrahim Rasool, has just days to clear out his office and leave America after being declared “persona non grata” by the Trump administration. The diplomatic bombshell dropped when Secretary of State Marco Rubio blasted Rasool as a “race-baiting politician who hates President Trump” in a social media post after the ambassador discussed white Americans becoming a minority. Rasool’s diplomatic privileges expired Monday, and he must be out of the country by Friday. President Ramaphosa is trying to downplay the crisis, calling it a “hiccup” and promising to engage “with deep respect” for Trump, but this comes right after Trump cut funding to South Africa over alleged “anti-white policies.” As our top diplomat gets ready to fly home, South Africans should watch closely – when ambassadors get expelled, serious economic and political fallout usually follows. Image source: SA Embassy Is Trump just Musk’s babysitter now? New photos from the White House have people asking: who’s really in charge — Donald Trump or Elon Musk? The pictures show Trump walking next to Musk’s four-year-old son while Musk walks ahead, talking to his staff. In one photo, Trump is even seen helping the boy — nicknamed “Lil X” — onto the presidential helicopter. Social media had a field day. “Trump finally got a real job — he’s Lil X’s nanny now,” one person joked. Another said: “Imagine being the president but spending your day babysitting a billionaire’s child.” Some people even asked, “Does this kid live at the White House now?” One user replied: “Of course he does — he’s the real president!” Musk posted one of the photos himself, calling it “a happy picture.” But many people noticed something else: Musk walking ahead like the boss, while Trump trails behind with the child. “It really shows who has the power,” one person wrote. Since Trump appointed Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (called DOGE), Musk has become one of the most powerful people in Washington. Musk was born in Pretoria and now he’s influencing major decisions in the US. That could affect South Africa too, from how we use social media and tech to deals around space, green energy and trade. If Musk is the one calling the shots, his choices could impact jobs, prices, and policies here at home. Image source: @POTUS Putin “agrees” to Trump’s ceasefire plan but with a catch Putin just said yes to Trump’s 30-day ceasefire plan for Ukraine, but don’t get too excited. While thanking Trump for “regulating the conflict,” Putin added he has “a lot of questions” and any deal must “lead to long-term peace” – Putin-speak for getting what he wants. The Russian leader couldn’t help boasting that his forces “are on the offensive everywhere” and warned Ukrainian troops they must “surrender or die.” Experts think Putin’s agreement comes with hidden conditions and might just be playing nice with Trump, who has now restored military aid to Ukraine after Zelenskyy agreed to ceasefire talks. Why should South Africans care? Because global conflicts affect our economy directly – from higher food prices to unstable markets. Plus, watching Trump broker deals between Russia and Ukraine shows how he handles international problems – a preview of what other countries (including ours) might face. Image source: File Trump’s right hand tells a story the White House won’t explain Something strange is going on with Trump’s hand. A dark mark keeps showing up in photos – most recently during his meeting with Ireland’s leader. The White House claims it’s just from Trump shaking too many hands. But medical experts aren’t buying it. Dr. Anatalia Moore, a skin specialist, says normal handshakes don’t cause bruises like that, Daily Star reported. She thinks it might be from a medical procedure where doctors put a drip in his hand. She also points out that at 78, Trump could bruise more easily from just bumping into things, as older people often have balance issues and their bodies heal slower. While it might just be makeup or a minor bruise, these marks are raising questions about the president’s health – something worth watching as his physical condition could affect his decisions on South Africa and other global issues. Image source: @POTUS Trump opens door for Afrikaner resettlement in America It’s official – the US is now actively working to bring Afrikaner South Africans to America as refugees. The US Embassy just confirmed they’re reviewing applications and will contact people who’ve already applied. This isn’t just Trump talking anymore – it’s becoming real policy. Trump claims South Africa is “confiscating” white farmers’ land “without compensation” after Ramaphosa signed the Expropriation Act. Most experts say this isn’t true, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from offering “a rapid pathway to citizenship” for these farmers. About 1,500 Afrikaners have already gathered outside the US Embassy in Pretoria to thank Trump for his support. Meanwhile, our government refuses to get into a shouting match with Trump, with Ramaphosa’s spokesperson saying South Africa won’t engage in “counterproductive megaphone diplomacy.” The big question now: How many farmers will actually pack up and leave? And what would that mean for our farms, food security, and race relations? Image source: File Trump’s market panic and what it means for South Africa By Dylan Bettencourt The US stock market just took a nasty dive after Trump twice dodged questions about a recession. Why should you care? Because when America sneezes, South Africa catches a cold. Trump’s chaos affects us directly: – When global markets panic, the Rand usually weakens – Weaker Rand = more expensive imports = higher prices at the shops – Foreign investors get nervous about putting money in countries like ours – Our exports become less valuable if America’s economy slows down Trump admitted his policies might cause economic “pain” before things get better. His own team is now rushing to calm markets, promising there won’t be a recession. For South Africans already struggling with high prices, Trump’s unpredictable style is the last thing we need. The big question: Will Trump back down like he did with Canada and Mexico, or stick to his disruptive plans? Either way, as one expert warned: “Good luck in this challenging time.” Image source: File De Klerk foundation rejects Trump’s farmer ‘rescue’ plan By Dylan Bettencourt The FW de Klerk Foundation has rejected Trump’s offer to give US citizenship to white South African farmers. Their message? Trump’s plan is based on “disinformation and cheap politics” with “no basis in truth.” Christo van der Rheede put it simply: “The challenges we face in South Africa aren’t just white people’s problems. We’re all affected by crime, unemployment and bad policies.” The Foundation warns that Trump’s actions will hurt South Africa’s economy and farming industry. They also connect Trump’s move to the rise of “ethnic nationalism” worldwide, suggesting right-wing groups are using this to attack South Africa’s non-racial democracy established in 1994. Meanwhile, our government won’t engage in “megaphone diplomacy” – choosing to ignore Trump’s social media outbursts rather than dignify them with a response. Image source: File Health Minister says Trump ‘doesn’t’ owe us a cent’ By Dylan Bettencourt Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said “Trump doesn’t owe South Africa any cent whatsoever” after the US president cut R8 billion in HIV/AIDS funding. Instead of complaining, he called on South Africa to “stand on our own” and revealed he’s already talking to other donors like the Gates Foundation to replace Trump’s money. EFF’s Malema had a different take, claiming the cuts are “Israel’s revenge” for South Africa’s support of Palestine. He also warned that land reform will continue “whether they like it or not.” Motsoaledi couldn’t resist taking a jab at right-wing group Solidarity’s recent White House visit, distinguishing them from the COVID Solidarity Fund that’s helping fill funding gaps. The bottom line for South Africans living with HIV? The political blame game won’t matter if someone doesn’t step up to save the program that employs 15,000 healthcare workers and keeps millions of patients alive. Image source: @MYANC Trump says ‘nobody has ever heard of’ Lesotho Trump just took a cheap shot at our neighbor Lesotho in his Congress speech, calling it a country “nobody has ever heard of” while Republican lawmakers laughed along. Why? He was defending his foreign aid cuts, specifically “$8 million for LGBTQI+” in Lesotho – though local LGBTQ groups say they never got this money. Lesotho’s Foreign Minister is angry, calling the comments “shocking” and promising to send a formal protest to Washington. The real impact? Lesotho has the world’s second-highest HIV rate, and Trump’s funding cuts threaten healthcare programs that people on both sides of the border rely on. For South Africans, it’s perhaps a reminder of how Trump sees African nations – as jokes, not partners. Image source: @POTUS Zelenskyy folds after Trump cuts military aid By Dylan Bettencourt Trump just announced he’s got a letter from Zelenskyy saying Ukraine is “ready to come to the negotiating table” – quite the U-turn after last week’s White House showdown. After getting his military aid cut off, Zelenskyy’s now saying he wants to “make things right” and is ready “any time and in any convenient format” to sign that minerals deal he previously walked away from. Trump’s also claiming he’s had “serious discussions with Russia” and received “strong signals they’re ready for peace.” For South Africans, this drama is worth watching closely. What happens when a superpower suddenly changes sides? We’re seeing countries that depend on American support scrambling to adjust. In Trump’s world, yesterday’s allies can become today’s bargaining chips – a lesson that applies just as much to Pretoria as it does to Kyiv. Image source: File Trump leaves Ukraine stranded By Dylan Bettencourt Trump just pulled the plug on Ukraine’s military aid after publicly arguing with Zelenskyy. No more weapons, no more ammo – not even stuff that’s already on ships heading there. It’s the same tactic he used when cutting South Africa’s HIV funding. One day you’ve got support, the next you don’t. When Zelenskyy dared say peace might be “very, very far away,” Trump didn’t hold back: the Ukrainian president “won’t be around very long” unless he plays ball. The message for countries like ours is crystal clear: in Trump’s world, you either give him what he wants or he’ll pull the rug out from under you – no warning, no negotiations. So when South African ministers next fly to Washington, they’d better have more than just goodwill in their briefcases. In Trumpland, it’s deal or no deal. Image source: File Trump vs Zelensky fight in White House Smackdown By Dylan Bettencourt Trump and Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy argued live on TV and SA analyst Sandile Swana says it’s a whole new ballgame. Gone are the days of friendly military aid. Trump’s message was crystal clear: “No minerals, no protection.” While Zelensky talked about friendship, Trump talked about business – leaving the Ukrainian leader visibly stunned. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Association of South Africa is urging us not to abandon Ukraine, warning that Putin won’t stop his expansion plans anytime soon. Trump’s “my way or the highway” approach could be coming to an international relationship near you. US ambassador quits as SA relations hit rock bottom By Dylan Bettencourt In the latest Trump-era shake-up, Dana Brown, America’s acting ambassador to South Africa, has suddenly resigned. This exit happens just as relations hit rock bottom, with Trump cutting all funding to South Africa and offering refugee status to Afrikaner farmers. The timing couldn’t be worse for South Africans. With no permanent US ambassador since January and Brown now leaving in March, our diplomatic channel to America is running on skeleton staff just when we need it most. Meanwhile, Afrikaner lobby groups AfriForum and Solidarity flew to the White House seeking “humanitarian assistance” – a move Ramaphosa slammed as “sowing divisions.” For ordinary South Africans, this diplomatic cold war threatens everything from healthcare funding to trade relations, showing how Trump’s personal politics directly impacts our national interests. Image source: US Embassy Trump axes USAID funding for HIV By Dylan Bettencourt Trump on Thursday pulled the plug on R8.1 billion in HIV funding, telling South African organisations to “immediately cease all activities.” He sent just letters saying the programs “aren’t aligned with Agency priorities.” This isn’t just American politics – it’s about your friend, neighbour or family member who depends on these services. Some 8 million South Africans rely on HIV treatment programs, and these cuts threaten real lives in our communities. While the government scrambles for a response, healthcare workers are losing jobs and vulnerable patients are left hanging. From sex workers to pregnant moms, the impact hits hardest on those who need help most.As one health worker put it to Bhekisasa: “This isn’t just a funding cut – it’s a betrayal.” Image source: File Gauteng minister copies Elon Musk strategy By Zukile Majova The Gauteng health department is checking if all 85,642 people on its payroll are real workers who actually show up for work. The department has already frozen the salaries of 66 workers who haven’t come forward to prove they exist. Health MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko says her department can’t waste money paying ghost workers when hospitals need more staff and patients need care. “We have limited resources at our disposal and cannot afford to waste money on ghost workers while hundreds of healthcare workers are looking for employment and thousands of people require access to healthcare services,” she said. The department’s new Ziveze (Reveal Yourself) Campaign follows a similar move by Elon Musk in America. Musk emailed US government workers asking them to prove what work they’ve done. The billionaire head of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency said: “All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” In Gauteng, workers must go to their HR office to prove they are real employees. Those who don’t show up risk losing their jobs and could face criminal charges. So far, 23,789 workers still need to prove they exist. Image source: @NkomoNomantu Ukraine fights back against Trump’s mineral grab By Rorisang Modiba Trump’s got Zelenskyy flying to Washington on Friday to sign a deal over Ukraine’s precious minerals. Trump initially wanted a massive $500bn chunk of Ukraine’s resources – imagine someone trying that with our platinum! Much like how South Africans get nervous when foreign companies eye our mineral wealth, Ukrainians weren’t having it. Zelenskyy flat-out refused to sign something “10 generations would have to repay.” Now, they’ve settled on sharing ownership instead – sound familiar? It’s the same dance our government does with mining giants over our resources. As global powers scramble for these battery metals and rare earths, South Africa should watch closely. This is exactly the kind of pressure our mineral-rich country could face next. Image source: File © Copyright Scrolla.Africa

July 31, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: AIR FRANCE - KLM AIR FRANCE - KLM xx July 31, 2025 FY 2025 outlook reconfirmed For 2025 the Group retains an agile approach given the current uncertainty and expects: Commenting on the results, Mr. Benjamin Smith, Group CEO, said: “Air France-KLM delivered a solid second quarter, with revenue growth and improved margins, reflecting the strength of our diversified network and the disciplined execution of our strategy. We are advancing premiumization, pushing the boundaries of aspirational travel with enhanced products and services, while progressing on the renewal of our fleet with next-generation aircraft, in line with our sustainability efforts. At the same time, we are reinforcing global connectivity through key partnerships and joint ventures in strategic areas, and, in early July, we initiated proceedings to take a majority stake in SAS. This marks a major step to strengthen our position in Northern Europe and expand our network reach. Although the external environment remains complex, Air France-KLM continues to demonstrate its resilience and is well positioned to achieve its targets. I want to thank all our teams for their continued commitment — their dedication is what makes this performance possible.” Solid Group unit revenue performance *IFRS Operating free cash flow corrected from the repayment of deferred social charges, pensions contributions and wage taxes granted during the Covid period and payment of lease debt and interests paid and received Operating result improvement driven by unit revenue development and fuel price evolution In the second quarter of 2025, Air France-KLM welcomed 27.3 million passengers which is 5.9% above last year. As capacity and traffic increased by 4.2%, the load factor remained stable at 87.8%. The Group unit revenue per ASK was up 2.4% year-on-year at constant currency, driven by strong yield performance in Network (passenger and cargo) and Transavia. Passenger yields were strong on the North Atlantic, despite the tariff turbulence, while also increasing in Asia & Middle East, Latin America and led by the premium cabins. Cargo continued to benefit from traffic out of Asia with unit revenues per ATK up 2.6% at constant currency. The operating result rose €223 million year-on-year to €736 million, with a margin of 8.7%. This performance was driven by a €176 million increase in unit revenues across the passenger network, Cargo and Transavia while unit costs including fuel remained broadly stable. Q2 unit cost1 was up 2.7% as a consequence of the below elements: Cash In the second quarter Air France/Air France-KLM and KLM extended both their Revolving Credit Facilities (RCF) until 2029. The total amount of the Group RCFs is maintained at €2.4 billion, and these facilities are currently undrawn. Through this transaction, Air France-KLM, Air France and KLM are extending the average maturity of available resources, in line with the Group's policy of careful liquidity management. For the first half of the year, the Group reported a positive operating free cash flow of €1,285 million, supported mainly by a favorable working capital from ticket sales, although impacted by the deferrals inherited from the pandemic which amounted to €244 million. Net capex amounted to €1.742 million. Recurring adjusted operating free cash flow2 reached €723 million, an increase of €589 million year-on-year. The operating free cash flow stood at €1.3 billion, partly offset by almost €1.2 billion in new and modified lease debt driven by fleet renewal and extension of current leases to cover delivery delays. As a consequence net debt decreased to €7.1 billion, down €197 million. The leverage ratio stood at 1.5x in line with the Group’s ambition of 1.5x to 2.0x. The level of cash at hand remains high and above the targeted level of €6 billion to €8 billion. At the end of June, the cash at hand stood at €9.4 billion, stable versus the end of 2024. During the first half year of 2025, the following transactions took place: The net proceeds of the issue of the Hybrid Bonds is used by the Company for refinancing of existing subordinated instruments within the Group. This issue enables the Group to simplify its balance sheet and optimize its cost of financing while maintaining financial flexibility. The Group’s strategy is to reduce the stock of subordinated instruments on its balance sheet. In July (after the Q2 closing) Air France-KLM fully redeemed the perpetual bonds issued in July 2022 for an amount of €500 million. These bonds were issued by an operating affiliate of Air France, that owns a pool of spare engines dedicated to the airline’s Engineering and Maintenance activities and was fully subscribed by Apollo affiliated entities. The transaction three years ago supported Air France-KLM in its trajectory to come back to a positive equity position under IFRS and the Group thanks Apollo for the smooth partnership during this trajectory. Rating update FY 2025 outlook reconfirmed For 2025 the Group retains an agile approach given the current uncertainty and expects: Sustainability Sustainability is a collective responsibility, and Air France- KLM is committed to play its role. The Group supports the adoption of ambitious environmental targets, advocating for an industry- wide transformation that ensures a global level playing field. Fleet Renewal In line with its fleet renewal strategy, Air France-KLM continues to take delivery of new generation aircraft such as Airbus A350s, B787-10, A320neo family aircraft, A220s, Embraer 195-E2s. These new generation aircraft consume up to 25% less fuel per passenger km and reduce the noise footprint by up to 63% compared to the previous generation aircraft they replace. At the end of June 2025, the Group had 30% of its fleet composed of new generation aircraft. The Group aims to get up to 80% of its fleet with new generation aircraft by 2030. SAF The Air France-KLM Group is working on increasing SAF demand and usage, driving its growth and development worldwide. On April 23, 2025, the Carb Aéro call for projects award ceremony was held at Air France’s headquarters at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. This initiative, part of the France 2030 investment program, aims to support the emergence of an e-SAF (synthetic drop-in fuel substitute to conventional fossil-based jet fuel) sector — a key technology in achieving the decarbonization goals of the aviation industry. As an airline group fully committed to decarbonizing its industry, Air France-KLM proudly hosted this event and reaffirmed its support for the development of an industrial ecosystem for sustainable fuel production in France — contributing to the country’s energy sovereignty and competitiveness. In June 2025, on the occasion of the Paris Air Show, Air France signed the SAF component of the New Energy Systems sector contract with the French government and industry partners. In the presence of Mr. Eric Lombard (Minister of Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty), Mr. Marc Ferracci (Minister for Industry and Energy), Mr. Philippe Tabarot (Minister for Transport) and Nathalie Delattre (Minister for Tourism), four main objectives were identified: In parallel, the Air France-KLM Group also signed an agreement with Airbus, enabling the aircraft manufacturer’s employees to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel by supporting SAF production. This voluntary commitment is part of the Air France-KLM “Corporate SAF” program and aims to develop a transparent, traceable, and verifiable SAF offering. GHG emissions per RTK (revenue ton-kilometer) At the end of June 2025, the indicator was 924 gCO₂eq/RTK6, which represents a 1.5% reduction compared to end of June 2024. Air France-KLM and its airlines are facing some headwinds to their GHG intensity reduction due to unforeseen and external events beyond the Group’s control, including delays in executing the fleet renewal plan due to constraints in the supply chain; engine issues with part of its new generation aircraft fleet (such as several Airbus A220’s) not allowing the Group to operate them to their maximum capacity; higher fuel consumption due to longer flight time on certain routes caused by different geopolitical circumstances. Given above headwinds it is unlikely that the 2025 target of the Sustainability Linked Bond will be reached. Post quarter events Air France-KLM to initiate proceedings to take a majority stake in SAS On the 4th of July 2025, Air France-KLM announced that it will initiate proceedings to take a majority stake in SAS. The Group currently holds a 19.9% stake in the Scandinavian carrier and since the summer of 2024, it has implemented a commercial cooperation between SAS, Air France and KLM in the form of extended code-share and interline agreements, further strengthened by SAS joining the SkyTeam alliance. Provided all the necessary conditions are met, Air France-KLM would fully acquire the stakes held by Castlelake and Lind Invest, bringing its own stake to 60.5%. The Danish State would retain its 26.4% stake in SAS and its seats on the Board of Directors. The value of Air France-KLM’s contemplated investment in SAS would be determined at closing, based on SAS’s latest financial performance – including EBITDA and Net Debt. This transaction would be in line with the Group’s medium-term financial outlook. Business review Network result Compared to the second quarter of 2024, total revenues increased by +4.6% to €6,937 million. The operating result reached €666 million up €190 million year-on-year at constant currency driven by higher revenues and fuel price reduction. The operating margin improved to 9.6%, an increase of 2.9 point compared to 2024. Passenger network delivers solid Q2 performance with Premium cabin strength and yield gains During the second quarter of 2025, capacity in Available Seat Kilometers (ASK) was 2.8% higher than last year. Traffic growth of +2.9% has led to a stable load factor at 87.4%. Yield at constant currency showed strong performance, up 2.8%, leading to a unit revenue of 2.8% year-on-year at constant currency. During the second quarter we observed the following trends in: North Atlantic Despite a 5% capacity growth, unit revenue increased by 5% driven by positive front cabin yield development while Economy cabin yield declined year-on-year. June performance was affected by the Middle East conflict. Latin America Unit revenue grew on the back of strong yield (+6.1%), while load factor was slightly up at 91% and capacity increased by 5.6%. Asia & Middle East Growth was mainly supported by Asia while Middle East capacity was impacted by geopolitical tensions. Strong performance on Japan, Korea & South-East Asia. Unit revenue in the region was up 6%, supported by strong yield development while load factor remained stable at 89%. Caribbean & Indian Ocean A strong industry wide capacity increase (Air France-KLM: +5%) led to a more competitive fare environment and 2% decline in unit revenue. AfricaCapacity, load factor and yield remained broadly stable year-on-year. Short and Medium-haul Overall, capacity rose 5%, with a broadly stable load factor at 85% and yield remaining flat. The focus was on stimulating local traffic and volumes to support additional capacity. In the first half of the year, revenue from the premium segment grew by 11% year-on-year, increasing its contribution to passenger network revenue to 28.7%, up from 27.3% in the same period last year. This positive trend was observed across all regions. The introduction of the new La Première cabin, which further strengthened the premium offering, generated great exposure. On the Transatlantic network, the premium revenue share remained broadly stable, above 41%. Premium and Premium Comfort continued its strong momentum with a 27% year-on-year increase, bringing its share in the passenger network revenue to 8.1%, compared to 6.7% in the first half year of 2024. Cargo: robust performance During the second quarter of 2025, capacity in Available Ton Kilometers (ATK) rose 1.4% year-on-year. Full freighter capacity was negatively impacted by longer-than-expected maintenance. Traffic grew 1.1% slightly below capacity growth keeping the load factor broadly stable at 45.5%. Together with a 3% increase in yield, unit revenue per ATK increased by 2.6% at constant currency. In June, KLM completed the cutover from the old IT systems to the new system which was already done last year by Air France. During the WACA (World Air Cargo Awards) 2025, Air France-KLM Cargo was declared Best European Airline. The award won by Air France-KLM Cargo is a recognition for airlines that have demonstrated outstanding performance and consistently provide excellent service, show leadership, and contribute to the development of the air cargo sector, globally or in their region. Transavia: Revenue growth and yield improvement support Q2 results amid cost pressures Transavia’s capacity in available seat kilometers grew 11.4%, while traffic increased by 11.2%, resulting in a broadly stable load factor. Unit revenue was up +2.9%, supported by positive yield development at both Transavia France and the Netherlands. However, Transavia Netherlands faced increased competition, partly due to redirected capacity from Middle East towards other European destinations, putting the unit revenues under pressure. Also the increase in Schiphol tariffs in combination with the increase of the ticket tax last year which is resulting in higher ticket prices was pushing travelers to airports in Germany. In France performance was affected by a strike that led to significant customer compensations. Overall, unit cost increased by 4.9% despite lower fuel prices, mainly due to an increase in wet leases activity for Transavia the Netherlands. Maintenance business: double digit growth and improved operating margin sssss The maintenance segment continued its strong growth in Q2 2025 with third-party revenues up 19.3%, driven by a strong recovery on the engine activities. The total revenues rose 14.6%. The operating result increased by €33 million and the operating margin improved to 5.1%, up 2.0 point from 2024. On June 17th, AFI KLM E&M, the MRO branch of Air France-KLM, and AerCap have announced that they have entered into exclusive negotiations to form a LEAP engine leasing joint venture. The parties intend to jointly own and manage a fleet of CFMI LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B engines enabling uninterrupted Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX fleet operations, while engines are going for a quick-turn or performance restoration shop visit within the AFI KLM E&M MRO network. The formation of this joint venture, which is subject to any necessary approval, will strengthen Air France KLM positioning on the MRO market by leveraging combined and complementary expertise in engine leasing, asset management and MRO services providing comprehensive MRO support to its customers all over the world. Through the second quarter 2025, AFI KLM E&M also finalized and announced numerous major long-term MRO contracts including: With these new contracts, Air France KLM MRO activity reinforces even further its market positioning and grows its order book on key strategic segments. Air France’s Q2 operating result improved significantly on unit revenue growth Air France Group In the second quarter, the operating result reached €490 million, up €295 million year-on-year. This performance was mainly driven by strong unit revenue growth (+3.4% year-on-year), reflecting the absence of last year’s €40m Olympic Games impact, sustained premium demand and high yield alongside lower fuel prices. Air France Group achieved an operating margin of 9.5%, up 5.4 points from 2024, despite the increase in the solidarity tax on flight tickets (TSBA), effective March 1, 2025, which is expected to impact the 2025 operating result by €90-170 million. KLM: Operating margin under pressure due to cost headwinds KLM Group Second quarter revenues grew 4.0%, in line with capacity growth. Yields improved for passenger network, Cargo and Transavia, while load factors decreased for all three businesses. The change in operating result reflects the impact of the NATO summit in June and last years’ positive maintenance-related one-off. Further improvement was constrained by higher Schiphol tariffs, the grounding of seven 787 aircraft in May, and last year’s CLA increase, mitigated by the delivery of Back on Track initiatives. The Back on Track program delivered €185 million in the first half of the year, as planned, with main contributions coming from various cost and revenue-improving initiatives and Maintenance. The latter supported performance by increasing third-party revenues and reducing non-performance cost at KLM. Productivity gains began in the second quarter from ground staff and cabin crew, though further acceleration depends partly on the outcome of ongoing CLA discussions. Meanwhile, Schiphol tariffs increased as of April and maintenance costs remain elevated. Despite headwinds like the delayed implementation of the CLA, the Back on track target of €450 million remains unchanged. Flying Blue delivers solid growth and robust margin in Q2 Flying Blue Miles In the second quarter Flying Blue Miles generated €226 million total revenue, including revenues from third party airline and non-airline partners. The operating margin reached 26.5%. Overall Flying Blue delivered a strong performance in the second quarter thanks to: Nb: Sum of individual airline and Flying Blue results does not add up to AF-KLM total due to intercompany eliminations at Group level. ****** The external auditors carried out limited review procedures.

Title: Crypto markets see $200M in liquidations as Fed’s Powell gives hawkish remarks
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-markets-see-200m-in-liquidations-as-feds-powell-gives-hawkish-remarks/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T02:41:19Z
Full Content:
A wave of volatility swept through the cryptocurrency markets on Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish remarks on inflation and tariffs sent leveraged traders scrambling. The sudden market tremor resulted in over $200 million in liquidations in a single hour, with Bitcoin briefly dipping below the $116,000 mark. The US central bank, as expected, left its benchmark interest rates unchanged in its latest policy decision. However, it was Chair Powell’s subsequent comments that captured the market’s full attention. He insisted on the potential for inflationary pressures to re-emerge, particularly from the impact of trade tariffs. This cautious stance was maintained even as two Federal Reserve officials dissented from the decision, signaling their preference for an immediate rate cut. The crypto market’s reaction to Powell’s hawkish tone was swift and sharp. In the hour that he spoke, liquidations of leveraged positions spiked to over $200 million across all digital assets, according to data from CoinGlass. Bitcoin (BTC) felt the immediate pressure, dipping below $116,000. However, the sell-off proved to be short-lived. Later in the session, Bitcoin managed to bounce back above $117,000, though it was still down 0.8% for the day and continued to trade at the lower end of its tight, three-week range. Ether (ETH) experienced a similar whipsaw, initially sliding by as much as 3% before recovering to trade at $3,750, ending the period with a modest loss of 0.6% over the past 24 hours. Altcoins initially posted even steeper declines, with Solana’s SOL, Avalanche’s AVAX, and Hyperliquid’s HYPE tokens all dropping by 4%-5% before paring their losses. Meme coins like BONK and PENGU plunged by as much as 10% each before also bouncing back. This volatility in the crypto space contrasted with positive developments in the traditional stock market, where tech giants Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) posted strong quarterly earnings, lifting their stocks by 10% and 6%, respectively, in after-hours trading. Despite Powell’s cautious rhetoric, some market analysts believe the Federal Reserve may be misjudging the economic landscape. “The market is increasingly starting to think the Fed may be behind the curve,” commented Matt Mena, an analyst at digital asset issuer 21Shares, in a market note. “Last week’s PCE [Personal Consumption Expenditures] print marked the second soft reading in a row, and consumer spending is weakening,” Mena wrote. With unemployment edging higher and real yields still restrictive, maintaining such tight policy risks overtightening into a broader slowdown. Mena suggested that the current market setup is reminiscent of the last quarter of 2023, a period characterized by “softening inflation, rising political volatility, and a Fed constrained by lagging indicators.” He argued that “the stage is set” for the Federal Reserve to eventually pivot to lower interest rates, a move that he believes could be a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin, potentially driving its price to $150,000 by the end of the year. For now, however, the market remains caught between the Fed’s current hawkish stance and the growing expectation of an eventual, and perhaps necessary, policy shift.

Title: Microsoft just revealed how much its flagship cloud platform makes—a whopping $75 billion a year
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/30/microsoft-earnings-azure-cloud-computing-artificial-intelligence/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T00:56:54Z
Full Content:
Microsoft said Wednesday that annual revenue for its flagship Azure cloud computing platform has surpassed $75 billion, up 34% from a year earlier. The Azure cloud business is a centerpiece of Microsoft’s efforts to shift its focus to artificial intelligence, but until Wednesday the company hadn’t disclosed how much money it makes. The revelation came in the software giant’s end-of-year earnings report, one that also showed a 24% spike in the company’s quarterly profit that beat Wall Street expectations and pleased investors wary about Microsoft’s ongoing construction of costly new data centers needed to meet cloud computing and AI demand. “We continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor,” CEO Satya Nadella said on an investor call, boasting that the company now has more than 400 of the sprawling facilities across six continents. Microsoft’s fiscal fourth-quarter profit was $34.3 billion, or $3.65 per share, beating analyst expectations for $3.37 per share. It posted revenue of $76.4 billion in the April-June period, up 18% from last year. Analysts polled by FactSet Research had been looking for revenue of $73.86 billion. Microsoft launched Azure more than a decade ago, but the service has increasingly become intertwined with its AI ambitions, as the company looks to sell its AI chatbot and other tools to big business customers that are also reliant on its core online services. It still trails behind its lead competitor, Amazon Web Services, which reported $107.6 billion in revenue for its fiscal year that ended in December. Building the infrastructure to power cloud and AI technology is expensive, and Microsoft has looked for savings elsewhere. It announced layoffs of about 15,000 workers this year even as its profits have soared. Nadella told employees last week the layoffs were “weighing heavily” on him but also positioned them as an opportunity to reimagine the company’s mission for an AI era. Still, the overall workforce numbers haven’t changed. The company said it employed 228,000 full-time employees as of June 30, the exact same amount it reported a year ago, though slightly more of them are now U.S.-based and fewer of them are in product support roles or consulting services. Promises of a leaner approach have been welcomed on Wall Street, especially as Microsoft and other tech giants are trying to justify huge amounts of capital spending to pay for the data centers, chips and other components required to power AI technology. Google said after releasing its earnings last week it would raise its budget for capital expenditures by an additional $10 billion to $85 billion. Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said she expects capital spending for the July-September quarter to be $30 billion. Microsoft didn’t disclose Wednesday to what extent sweeping U.S. tariffs are affecting its revenue, but its annual report lists tariffs among a number of risks the company faces. “Increased geopolitical instabilities and changing U.S. administration priorities create an unpredictable trade landscape,” the company said. It also said the “volatility of U.S. tariffs has triggered economic uncertainty and could impact cloud and devices supply chain cost competitiveness.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.
