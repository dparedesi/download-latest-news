(ABC News: Jake Lapham) A federal inquiry into nuclear energy has held a hearing in Muswellbrook in the NSW Upper Hunter region. Speakers discussed future employment, environmental concerns and expressed frustration with policy, but not the suitability of the region for a nuclear facility despite recent earthquakes. The inquiry will hold hearings in Lithgow and Sydney this week before moving to Western Australia. A nuclear energy inquiry has sparked an emotional debate about the economic future of Muswellbrook, the coal capital of New South Wales, but a spate of earthquakes in the region went unmentioned. The House Select Committee on Nuclear Energy is touring the country to investigate the viability of the federal Coalition's nuclear energy proposal. On Tuesday, it sat in Muswellbrook but there were no questions raised about the suitability of the area for nuclear power stations due to its high seismic activity. Coal mine closures are slated for the region and most of the discussion was about whether renewable projects or other energy sources such as nuclear could employ the thousands of coal workers likely to be impacted. Steve Reynolds believes in an energy mix that could include nuclear power. (ABC Upper Hunter: Romy Stephens) Former Muswellbrook mayor Steve Reynolds told the hearing he felt the majority of Muswellbrook locals were "quiet supporters" of nuclear. But he said that bringing in a "a balanced energy mix right across the system" – including nuclear energy – would be an effective way to protect the town's economy. "[That will provide] steady full-time jobs and is also protecting our farmland," Mr Reynolds said. Mining and Energy Union northern district secretary Robin Williams told the hearing he thought the Coalition's plan was "unrealistic" and would not "come to fruition". "None of our energy companies are interested in building nuclear power stations," he said. "The Coalition has engaged with energy culture wars … and I believe that is what they are continuing to do now." Since early August the Muswellbrook area has experienced several earthquakes, including four above magnitude 4. The Coalition's proposed nuclear power plan includes a reactor at the site of the former Liddell coal-fired power station, which is only a few kilometres away from the epicentre of the spate of quakes. A natural disaster declaration was issued to Muswellbrook Shire Council in early December, weeks after the "earthquake swarm" hit the town. But the Muswellbrook earthquakes were not mentioned at the hearing today. Former Bayswater coal-fired power station engineer Trevor Woolley, an opponent of the nuclear proposal, was one of the first to speak at the hearing. He said the debate around the region's energy future had deepened a social divide in the community. "[There is] so much fear, anger, false facts, driven by a very poor planning system," Mr Woolley said. Rosemary Hadaway told the inquiry that nuclear waste could have a devastating impact on future generations. (ABC Upper Hunter: Romy Stephens) Mudgee District Environment Group representative Rosemary Hadaway spoke about the environmental impact of waste if nuclear energy was pursued in Australia and said it would have a "reprehensible" impact on future generations. "What are we doing to our planet by creating this huge level of toxic pollution for many thousands of generations?" she asked. "We have no right to do that." Two of the town's Indigenous leaders questioned the long-term economic viability of the Hunter and what would replace coal jobs. Wonnarua Nation Aboriginal Corporation chief executive and mine rehabilitation worker Laurie Perry told the hearing nuclear did not make sense for communities on Wonnarua Country. He has called for more consultation on the proposal and shared his view that Indigenous people are often only briefly consulted for energy projects in their initial stages. "The only time we are engaged is when they want a mining lease, then we do the cultural and heritage work," he said. Blackrock Industries founder Steve Fordham told the inquiry the government had failed to help secure jobs. (ABC Upper Hunter: Romy Stephens) But the founder of miner Blackrock Industries, Steve Fordham, slammed the Albanese and former Coalition governments for not planning for the future sooner. The National Party member supports the nuclear idea as part of a mix of energy projects to sustain local jobs. "It’s war on our jobs — day in day out it’s getting tougher and tougher and tougher," he said. "The government has not had the balls to do anything. "We need investment, we need an opportunity." The inquiry will sit in WA after the hearings in NSW finish. (Unsplash: Nicolas HIPPERT/CC licence) Peter Dutton is expected to release costings of the Coalition's nuclear energy plan this week. He was spotted in the Muswellbrook community today but did not attend the inquiry. On Monday a CSIRO report concluded nuclear power would likely cost twice as much as renewable energy. The inquiry has recently visited regional South Australia and Victoria and two more hearings will take place in NSW before it moves to Western Australia.

(Bloomberg) -- Baillie Gifford & Co., known for investing in hyper-growth tech stocks, now likes “boring” US infrastructure companies as it sees a building boom after many years of under-investment. Most Read from Bloomberg Brace for a Nationwide Shuffle of Corporate Headquarters A Chicago Skyscraper Cements the Legacy of a Visionary Postmodern Architect Cloud Computing Tax Threatens Chicago’s Silicon Valley Ambitions NYC’s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp Kansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit “We think there’s going to be a massive building boom certainly in the US, the UK and in some other places,” Stuart Dunbar, a partner at the Edinburgh-based firm, told Bloomberg in Tokyo. Baillie Gifford still likes some US big tech stocks but is underweight on many of them now because of high valuations, he said. “In parts of Europe and in the US, the infrastructure is just falling apart. It’s been under-invested for 50 years and it’s getting to the point where it can’t be ignored any longer, with bridges falling down literally,” Dunbar said. “It’s quite an unexpected source of growth, like building aggregates suppliers, drainage systems providers,” he said, mentioning companies such as Advanced Drainage Systems Inc. and Stella-Jones Inc. as among its favorites. Baillie Gifford has been known for its big bets in large tech firms such as Tesla Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. But it’s now underweight most such US stocks — an unusual stance for the firm — despite its positive long-term view on them, Dunbar said. Investment in suppliers of water pipes and utility poles is by no means a departure from its growth stock strategy, though. “We will look wherever we need to look to try to find the companies that we think have got the ability not only to grow quickly, but to do so profitably,” Dunbar said. For tech stocks, Nvidia Corp.’s high valuation depends on continued growth, according to the investment manager. Nvidia, which makes chips used for AI data centers, trades at 34 times expected earnings, well above 23 times for the S&P 500 index. “That growth isn’t likely sustainable in the long term unless we start to see meaningful value coming through from applications of AI, so we’ve been top-slicing it,” Dunbar said, adding that Baillie Gifford still holds Nvidia and doesn’t have a negative view. Baillie Gifford is more cautious on Google parent Alphabet Inc., fretting that “AI could be a Google killer,” Dunbar said. On the other hand, it’s still a fan of Amazon because strong research and development spending allows it keep a solid competitive position. Meta also has a strong data set on which the firm can build AI capabilities, while Tesla has “incredible robotics and energy businesses” even though its rival BYD Co. “makes better cars at half the price,” he added. BYD is among China tech shares that Baillie Gifford sees coming back, despite headwinds from threats of tariffs from the US, and Europe in the case of EV makers. Elsewhere, the investment manager thinks digital banking is an important trend, betting on fintech firms such as Nu Holdings Ltd. in Brazil and Adyen NV in the Netherlands.

Title: Feeder schools: Record numbers of students from disadvantaged areas progress to third level

The number of school-leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds progressing to college has climbed towards record levels. The figures are contained in the 2024 Irish Times Feeder School list, which provides a school-by-school guide of progression rates to third level this year. About 80 per cent of school-leavers nationally went to third level in 2024. The proportion of college-going students from Deis schools – typically located in more economically deprived areas – has climbed to 64 per cent. This is up from 57 per cent in 2019 and matches a record high of 63-64 per cent last recorded during the Covid pandemic, when students from Deis schools benefited to a greater extent from predicted grades. Among the likely factors behind the increase include the creation of additional college places, the growth of technological universities in regional areas, and access initiatives aimed at forging closer links between Deis schools and third-level colleges. [ Feeder Schools 2024: How did your school and county perform?Opens in new window ] To see all of our Feeder School tables broken down by gender and fee-paying and non-fee paying, scroll to the end of this page. Overall, Irish-medium schools or gaelcholáistí sent the highest proportion of school leavers to third level (96 per cent), followed by fee-charging schools (93 per cent), non-Deis schools (82 per cent) and Deis schools (64 per cent). When broken down by individual schools, the top 50 schools with the highest progression rates sent almost all their school-leavers to higher education. Coláiste Íosagáin, Booterstown, Co Dublin tops this year’s Feeder School 2024 list. It was followed by Sacred Heart Community School, Clonakilty, Co Cork; Coláiste Mhuire, Crosshaven, Co Cork; Jesus and Mary College, Goatstown, Co Dublin; Coláiste Chiaráin, Co Kildare; and Presentation College, Cork City. Schools with the highest progression rates are typically based in more affluent areas. Researchers say factors such as family education levels and access to private supports, such as grinds, can help boost pupils’ performance. Some schools recorded dramatic increases in the proportion of school-leavers who have gone to university over the past five years. For example, third-level progression rates at Ballinode Community College, Sligo, jumped by the highest amount of any school between 2018 and 2024 (up 66 per cent). It is followed by Ardscoil Phádraig, Co Longford (51 per cent), Dominican College, Blackrock, Co Dublin (47 per cent) and Holy Child Community School, Sallynoggin, Co Dublin (44 per cent). This year’s Feeder School lists also show how the class gap in third-level participation persists, especially in Dublin postal districts. For example, the most affluent parts of the capital, such as Dublin 6 – which includes Ranelagh – recorded third-level progression rates among school leavers of almost 100 per cent. This compares with college progression rates of 49 per cent in Dublin 10 – which includes Ballyfermot – and 56 per cent in Dublin 11, which includes Finglas. The class gap is even more stark when the figures are broken down into those who sat the Leaving Cert in 2024 and secured places in traditional universities, which tend to have higher CAO entry requirements. In Dublin 6, some 68 per cent went on to a traditional university, compared with 26 and 33.1 per cent in Dublin 10 and 11. The feeder school 2024 data does not capture the proportion of students who may have gone on to secure apprenticeships or places in further education. While The Irish Times has sought this information, education authorities say it is not systematically collected. Overall, this year’s numbers cement Ireland’s exceptionally high third-level participation rate, which is among the highest in the world. Ireland also continues to have one of the highest retention rates at second level across Europe, or the proportion of students who stay in school until the Leaving Cert.

Title: Omnicom’s acquisition of IPG could usher in a new, inevitable M&A wave

Save $300 on any 2025 Digiday event pass with code SAVE2025. Ends Dec. 31 Save $300 on any 2025 Digiday event pass with code SAVE2025. Ends Dec. 31 That’s one hell of a way for the agency holding companies to end the year. Just as everyone was looking to slow down and take a holiday-induced break before what will be a turbulent 2025, along comes Omnicom with a proposed stock-driven acquisition of Interpublic Group. The two CEOs — Omnicom’s John Wren and IPG’s Philippe Krakowsky — shared on their conference call Monday morning to announce the deal that they have been discussing this combination for the better part of a year. Suffice it to say that, should the deal clear regulatory and shareholder approvals — (those CEOs are hoping it will clear in the second half of 2025) — the combined $30 billion revenue will give the industry the equivalent of a megalodon shark in a sea of great whites and hammerheads. Lest we forget, megalodon went extinct because it was simply too big. So before panic sets in too significantly for the likes of WPP, Publicis and Dentsu, and the myriad independent agencies that have made a living feeding off the fish that the sharks don’t eat, this kind of bigger isn’t always seen as better. But to hear Wren and Krakowsky tell it, this merger makes more sense today than ever. They have their eyes on the Googles and Metas of the world. So much that Krakowsky referred the combined company as a platform rather than a holdco. “Being a part of what is now a platform, essentially a company with exceptional talent and reach and capabilities, and knowing that you can bring those to bear for your client, or that they’re going to give you an opportunity, as John [Wren] says, to build a more interesting career — there’s a lot of enthusiasm for it inside our organization,” he told analysts and reporters on a Monday morning conference call with Wren and both companies’ CFOs. The combined entity would become by far the largest holding company in the communications world, with an expected cash flow of more than $3 billion, according to the information provided by the companies. The principals also cite the complementary resources and geographies. A few examples: But the truth is, both companies needed to do this. Of the six sources reached for this story, all noted that IPG has not had a good stretch the last few years, having lost Amazon, General Motors and several other large and small clients that outweighed its gains. Two sources even said they see Omnicom’s acquisition as a bit of a bailout. “I think this is a very welcome distraction from what has been a disastrous year for IPG,” said one executive outside both companies, who declined to speak for attribution. Added David Jones, CEO of Brandtech Group, a rival to both holdcos: The acquisition “makes huge sense in the short term — both have been having their lunch eaten by Publicis, and IPG declined last year in organic growth. This gives both of them a story for their shareholders. It gives the merged company the ability to carry out financial re-engineering and restatements that will help the numbers look better in the short term.” Ouch. Meantime, the union doesn’t come cheaply. In the Monday conference call, Wren cited $450 million in “one-time cash cost” to close the deal and achieve $750 million in “cost synergies” — which includes layoffs among the 100,000 employees of both holdcos. Oddly, Wren did add, and employees of both companies should take note: “Any employee listening to this, if you’re associated with any revenue stream at all, you’re gold, don’t worry about it.” Observers of the deal don’t think things will end up quite so magnanimously for staffers, particularly those in back-office roles. “This deal will no doubt create a lot of uncertainty for staff and clients on both sides,” said Ryan Kangisser, chief strategy officer at media consultancy MediaSense. “Notwithstanding the cost synergies (and implications this will bring), clients will be considering how their requirements will be met during an extreme period of transition and transformation.” How is the rest of the agency world affected? For one, it will most likely set off a chain reaction of M&A, because no other holding company can stay put as they are. “I expect to see more M&A activity on the back of this deal,” said Kangisser. “It’s easy to forget there are a number of very well funded, and highly acquisitive challenger groups who will look to fill this vacuum and provide clients with greater optionality.” “Start looking at all these other combinations,” said another high-level agency executive who declined to speak on the record. “The other guys are going to have to do something. I think this is the starting gun for major, major consolidation.” Every source reached for this story had their own scenario that could unfold. WPP, which has just been leapfrogged in size and scale, has long been the subject of breakup rumors. Havas just got spun out by parent company Vivendi, making it easier to pick by the likes of, say, Accenture or Dentsu. And Publicis, which analysts see as neck and neck with Omnicom in its success in the marketplace, isn’t likely to be left in the dust, despite already having acquired Influential and Mars United Commerce earlier this year. Nor should Omnicom itself be precluded from other purchases. Wren said the the $3 billion in cash flow would allow the company to continue to be acquisitive. For independents who have staked their claim to being the antidote to the holdco system and process, Christmas seemingly has come early. The deal “provides the independents the room to be able to articulate their propositions,” said Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester. “Their counterpoint is skill, and this just helps frame their proposition of being able to balance the buying scale that they’re accumulating with the performance scale that they’ve developed.” And how will clients feel about this? Amazon just left IPG and gave some of its media business to Omnicom. Will this stir up unhappiness? Wren and Krakowsky poo-poo’d any notion that clients will have a problem with the acquisition. Jay Wilson, an analyst at Gartner, noted that the size of client will impact how much they’re affected. “It’s unlikely any single client will see an immediate impact on its relationship with existing IPG or Omnicom agencies, and those with large relationships at a holding company level will probably see the slowest transition — for example to a new hold-co wide data spine like IPG’s Acxiom,” said Wilson. “Clients of single agencies within these networks may be the first affected, if and when the new organization decides to merge individual agencies, as many hold co’s have been doing in recent years.” Omnicom CEO John Wren and IPG CEO Philippe Krakowsky said the plan is to pool resources for bigger AI investments. Mosaic Media CEO Mary Ann Pruitt believes in the “great equalizer” of programmatic marketplaces, which to her have empowered independents to compete with holding companies on a level they never have before. But it’s more than just programmatic access—it’s the broader tech abilities that are accessible to all agencies Screenvision Media and Spotlight Cinema Networks have formed the Cinema Programmatic Alliance, which aims to make their inventory available to advertisers and agencies placing dollars through programmatic firms.

Title: China Evergrande liquidators put founder’s private jet up for sale

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Evergrande founder Hui Ka Yan was once China's richest man. Photo / AFP Evergrande’s liquidators are trying to sell an Airbus private jet that belonged to the collapsed property developer’s founder, as they attempt to salvage some returns for the overseas investors who bought billions of dollars of the company’s bonds. Alvarez & Marsal specialists Edward Middleton and Tiffany Wong, who were appointed to liquidate Evergrande’s Hong Kong-listed holding company in January, have taken control of the offshore entity that bought Hui Ka Yan’s jet and have put the jet up for sale, three people with knowledge of the matter said. The plane, a business jet variant of the Airbus A319, which is the size of a commercial passenger jet, is in Guangzhou in southern China, according to flight records. The plane was one of several markers of wealth Hui amassed as he became one of the richest men in China during the company’s boom years, embodying a new breed of splashy Chinese tycoons. The liquidators’ move sets up a test of their ability to enforce their ownership of assets in mainland China, whose legal system differs from the Hong Kong regime under which they were appointed. Any successful sale would mark an early sign of progress by liquidators trying to return cash to investors exposed to the more than US$20 billion ($34.2b) in offshore debt Evergrande had when it defaulted in 2021, debt now almost worthless at current prices. Once China’s biggest property developer, Evergrande had more than US$300b in total liabilities when it defaulted, precipitating a broader cash crunch in the country’s property sector. Hui bought mansions in London, Sydney and Hong Kong as well as a 60-metre megayacht and a football team, Guangzhou Evergrande. In 2017 he topped the Forbes China rich list with a total net worth of nearly US$43b. A Hong Kong judge in January ordered the winding up of Evergrande’s holding company in the territory, where it listed in 2009. Evergrande said last year Hui had been placed under “mandatory measures” on suspicion of involvement in “illegal crimes”. Hui could not be reached for comment. Alvarez & Marsal declined to comment. The private jet, which is now 14 years old and in need of some repair and maintenance work, was “bigger [and] more expensive to operate” than many other private jets, said Jason Liao, chairman and chief executive of China Business Aviation Group. He estimated it would be worth about US$25 million to US$30m, compared with about US$90m when new. Funds managed by BlackRock and HSBC were among those exposed to Evergrande bonds when it defaulted in 2021. The liquidators are also trying to recoup funds by bringing lawsuits against Evergrande’s executives and the global professional services firms that helped enable its rapid growth by accessing foreign funding. They have launched court proceedings against Big Four audit firm PwC, commercial real estate services company CBRE and advisory group Avista Valuation Advisory. PwC and CBRE declined to comment and Avista did not respond to requests to comment. They are trying to recover US$6b from Hui and other top company executives in a separate suit. In March, the China Securities Regulatory Commission accused Hui and Evergrande’s mainland business of inflating revenues by US$78b over 2019 and 2020. The plane is one of three private jets listed among Hui’s assets in court filings from March this year. The filings said he also owned an Airbus A330 and a Gulfstream G450 jet as well as two yachts and two Rolls-Royce Phantoms. © Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Oracle stock is down almost 8% after earnings miss and elevated cloud expectations

Oracle fell nearly 8% in extended trading after it reported quarterly earnings that slightly missed estimates and the company issued weaker-than-expected guidance. The software provider reported fiscal second-quarter revenue of $14.1 billion, a 9% year-on-year increase. It reported $4.21 billion in profit, or $1.47 per share, for the three months that ended in late November. Oracle's cloud services business, which has customers including OpenAI, xAI, and Nvidia, grew 12% from last year and made up 77% of the company's total quarterly revenue. Oracle said it expects revenue growth between 7% and 9% for the current quarter. This would bring revenue expectations to about $14.3 billion, below analyst estimates of $14.65 billion. The company's business is booming due to sky-high demand for computing from artificial intelligence companies seeking to train their models. Oracle's stock has surged 80% this year, boosting its market value from below $165 billion in late 2022 to north of $500 billion. The enterprise-computing giant's stock decline on Monday resulted from high expectations going into the results. Fiscal second-quarter expectations are elevated coming out of a bullish September analyst day and long-term revenue targets that imply a multi-year growth acceleration, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note last week. At the analyst day in September, Oracle forecast annual revenue to rise to at least $104 billion in fiscal year 2029, a sign of its continued growth in cloud infrastructure. Investors are likely also reacting to mixed results. Key metrics include capital expenditure, which was above consensus; growth of infrastructure-as-a-service, which was in line with consensus; and growth of backlog, an Oracle product, which missed estimates. Oracle competes with Google, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft in the cloud infrastructure business. "Our cloud is faster and is less expensive than other clouds," Oracle's CEO Safra Catz said on an earnings call on Monday. "We remain the preferred cloud for AI workloads." On Monday, the company also announced a deal with Meta to use Oracle's AI cloud infrastructure to develop the social media giant's Llama AI models. Oracle's soaring stock price this year has boosted the net worth of Larry Ellison, who cofounded the company and is chief technology officer. His Oracle stock — he holds more than 40% of the company's shares — puts him third on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list, worth $234.8 billion as of Monday. Jump to

Title: Why Is Nordson Corporation (NDSN) Among the Best Dividend Kings to Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nordson Corporation (NASDAQ:NDSN) stands against the other dividend kings. Investors often focus on stock price movements, anticipating gains, but may underestimate the value of dividends as a key component of returns. This becomes particularly attractive when looking at companies with a history of steadily increasing their dividends. That’s where Dividend Kings come into play. These businesses have consistently raised their payouts for at least 50 years. Achieving this milestone is no small feat, with only around 54 out of thousands of publicly traded US companies earning this distinction. This dividend growth can be attributed to the solid financial positions of many high-quality companies. Since the pandemic began, these reserves have steadily increased, as a strong economy has allowed businesses to save more and earn returns on short-term investments. According to an analysis by the Carfang Group, based on the Federal Reserve's quarterly flow of funds, US companies increased their cash holdings in the first quarter of 2024, reaching a record $4.11 trillion. This growth, supported by a resilient economy and relatively high interest rates, marked a 12.6% increase from the same period last year and was $1.28 trillion higher than pre-pandemic levels. Recent trends also showed that companies have been shifting more of their investments toward corporate and US government debt, according to Clearwater Analytics, which analyzed nearly 400 corporate portfolios with assets totaling just under $1 trillion. Despite this shift, most funds remain allocated to cash or cash-equivalent instruments, which delivered annualized returns exceeding 5.48% in May, as reported by Clearwater. Also read: 8 Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in Focusing on dividend growth reveals its significant appeal over the years. Stocks known for consistent dividend increases have performed exceptionally well, with the Dividend Aristocrats index standing out as a key benchmark. This index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has consistently delivered strong returns, often surpassing other asset classes despite market fluctuations. ProShare emphasized the index’s value for income-focused investors, noting its history of outperforming the broader market while exhibiting lower volatility since its inception. Their report highlighted that a $10,000 investment in the index in May 2005 could have grown to over $61,000 by March 2023. The report also mentioned that the index outperformed the market during eight of the ten largest quarterly declines since 2005. In addition to shareholder returns, dividend stocks have played a pivotal role in driving overall market performance, delivering substantial contributions. A report from T. Rowe Price highlighted that compounded dividends accounted for over 70% of global market returns. Similarly, the Harvard Business Review revealed that dividends made up nearly 37% of corporate earnings between 2003 and 2012. Consistently maintaining dividend payouts is a significant challenge for companies, even more so than increasing them regularly. Analysts caution against falling for yield traps—stocks that offer high yields but have unreliable dividend policies. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, emphasized the importance of prioritizing quality over yield in dividend investing during an interview with CNBC. He advised focusing on high-quality companies that typically offer dividend yields of around 3% to 4%. These businesses often demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payments, providing a steady income stream while mitigating the effects of inflation. Additionally, he noted that lower-yield stocks are generally safer, with more dependable payout structures. Given this, we will discuss some of the best dividend kings for safe dividend growth. Our Methodology: For this article, we scanned the list of dividend kings, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. From that list, we picked 8 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their annual average dividend growth in the past five years. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Nordson Corporation (NASDAQ:NDSN)'s cash position came in strong in the most recent quarter. The company ended the quarter with over $165.3 million available in cash and cash equivalents, up from $115.6 million in the prior-year period. Its operating cash flow came in at $460 million. Nordson Corporation (NASDAQ:NDSN) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, having raised it by 14.7% in August this year.

While we acknowledge the potential for NDSN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Stepan Company (NYSE:SCL) stands against the other dividend kings. Investors often focus on stock price movements, anticipating gains, but may underestimate the value of dividends as a key component of returns. This becomes particularly attractive when looking at companies with a history of steadily increasing their dividends. That’s where Dividend Kings come into play. These businesses have consistently raised their payouts for at least 50 years. Achieving this milestone is no small feat, with only around 54 out of thousands of publicly traded US companies earning this distinction. This dividend growth can be attributed to the solid financial positions of many high-quality companies. Since the pandemic began, these reserves have steadily increased, as a strong economy has allowed businesses to save more and earn returns on short-term investments. According to an analysis by the Carfang Group, based on the Federal Reserve's quarterly flow of funds, US companies increased their cash holdings in the first quarter of 2024, reaching a record $4.11 trillion. This growth, supported by a resilient economy and relatively high interest rates, marked a 12.6% increase from the same period last year and was $1.28 trillion higher than pre-pandemic levels. Recent trends also showed that companies have been shifting more of their investments toward corporate and US government debt, according to Clearwater Analytics, which analyzed nearly 400 corporate portfolios with assets totaling just under $1 trillion. Despite this shift, most funds remain allocated to cash or cash-equivalent instruments, which delivered annualized returns exceeding 5.48% in May, as reported by Clearwater. Also read: 8 Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in Focusing on dividend growth reveals its significant appeal over the years. Stocks known for consistent dividend increases have performed exceptionally well, with the Dividend Aristocrats index standing out as a key benchmark. This index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has consistently delivered strong returns, often surpassing other asset classes despite market fluctuations. ProShare emphasized the index’s value for income-focused investors, noting its history of outperforming the broader market while exhibiting lower volatility since its inception. Their report highlighted that a $10,000 investment in the index in May 2005 could have grown to over $61,000 by March 2023. The report also mentioned that the index outperformed the market during eight of the ten largest quarterly declines since 2005. In addition to shareholder returns, dividend stocks have played a pivotal role in driving overall market performance, delivering substantial contributions. A report from T. Rowe Price highlighted that compounded dividends accounted for over 70% of global market returns. Similarly, the Harvard Business Review revealed that dividends made up nearly 37% of corporate earnings between 2003 and 2012. Consistently maintaining dividend payouts is a significant challenge for companies, even more so than increasing them regularly. Analysts caution against falling for yield traps—stocks that offer high yields but have unreliable dividend policies. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, emphasized the importance of prioritizing quality over yield in dividend investing during an interview with CNBC. He advised focusing on high-quality companies that typically offer dividend yields of around 3% to 4%. These businesses often demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payments, providing a steady income stream while mitigating the effects of inflation. Additionally, he noted that lower-yield stocks are generally safer, with more dependable payout structures. Given this, we will discuss some of the best dividend kings for safe dividend growth. Our Methodology: For this article, we scanned the list of dividend kings, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. From that list, we picked 8 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates.

(see more details here). An industrial complex with its towering smokestacks, showing the scale of the company's specialty chemicals operations. 5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 8.06% Stepan Company (NYSE:SCL) is an Illinois-based chemical manufacturing company that specializes in specialty chemicals for consumer and industrial purposes. The stock is down by nearly 18% since the start of 2024 due to industry-related challenges. However, the company still managed to deliver strong earnings in the third quarter of 2024. Its adjusted EBITDA experienced double-digit growth, fueled by strong performance in the Surfactant and Specialty Product segments. Surfactants showed a notable volume recovery, achieving double-digit growth across the Agricultural, Oilfield, Construction and Industrial Solutions sectors, as well as through Distribution partners. In Latin America, Surfactant volumes increased by mid-single digits, supported by robust demand in Brazil's Agricultural markets and new business contracts in Mexico. Stepan Company (NYSE:SCL) reported revenue of $546.8 million, which fell slightly by 3% from the same period last year. Net sales decreased due to a combination of factors, including a 1% decline in volume, reduced selling prices, and the effects of foreign currency translation. That said, the company remains on course to achieve its $50 million cost reduction target for 2024, having realized $13.3 million in pre-tax savings during the third quarter. Stepan Company (NYSE:SCL)'s cash generation remained strong during the quarter. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $22.7 million and its free cash flow came in at $4 million. Due to its solid cash position, the company managed to raise its payouts for 57 years in a row. Moreover, in the past five years, it has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of over 8%, which makes it one of the best dividend kings on our list. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.385 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.01%, as of December 9. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Stepan Company (NYSE:SCL) jumped to 13 in Q3 2024, from 8 in the preceding quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is nearly $33 million. Among these hedge funds, Gotham Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall SCL ranks 8th on our list of the best dividend kings to invest in for safe dividend growth. While we acknowledge the potential for SCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks. This year, artificial intelligence played a key role in two Nobel Prizes for scientific achievement. One prize was awarded for developing the technology, while the other was for its application. These two Nobel Prize wins clarify that AI is here to stay. However, key issues such as regulations, ethical use, and other potential risks, still need to be resolved for responsible and sustainable integration into society. READ NOW: Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines On Saturday, December 7, Physics Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton and Chemistry laureate Demis Hassabis asserted the need for strong regulation of artificial intelligence, having played a key role in their awards. "AI is a very important technology to regulate but I think it's very important that we get the regulations right and I think that's the hard thing at the moment is it's such a fast moving technology”. According to Hassabis, having jointly won the Nobel Prize with Americans David Baker and John Jumper for revealing the secrets of proteins through AI, the main issue is defining the purpose, deployment, and making sure that artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. In this regard, British-Canadian Hinton, considered the "Godfather of AI”, said he wished he had thought about safety earlier, reflecting his worries about how AI could potentially escalate the arms race. He gained attention last year after he left Google to warn against risks of AI outsmarting people someday, and was awarded a Nobel Prize along with American John Hopfield for work on artificial neural networks. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed deregulation and also shared his views to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI after he takes office in January. Nevertheless, it is still yet to unfold how he will approach AI regulation in particular. Trump has already appointed David Sacks as the AI and crypto czar, showcasing his proactive stance on advancing artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency innovation. In light of this, Axios reported that the US government has approved the export of advanced artificial intelligence chips to a facility in the United Arab Emirates as part of the company's highly-scrutinized partnership with Emirati AI firm G42. There were concerns raised about the transfer of sensitive technology to China, and the approved export license includes strict conditions to prevent access to the facility by personnel from nations under U.S. arms embargoes or those listed on the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security's Entity List.

On December 6, Citi raised the firm’s price target on AppLovin (APP) to $460 from $335 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. The firm is bullish on the company’s growth prospects, particularly in mobile gaming and eCommerce. As a result, it has slightly raised its forecast and recalibrated its target multiple to accurately reflect the company’s peer group and growth prospects. The management has also pointed out the company’s model enhancements, which is supported by AppLovin's AI-driven tools like Axon 2.0, the company’s advertising platform that optimizes ad targeting and performance. In addition, early traction from the firm’s push into eCommerce, also heavily reliant on AI, and the potential scope to improve conversion rates, were also highlighted.

Title: After Four Years And Billions Of Dollars, The Texas Grid Is Not Fixed

HOUSTON, TX - FEBRUARY 18: People line up at a propane gas station to refill their tanks after ... [+] winter weather caused electricity blackouts on February 18, 2021 in Houston, Texas. Winter storm Uri brought severe temperature drops causing a catastrophic failure of the power grid in Texas. About two million people are without electricity throughout Houston. (Photo by Go Nakamura/Getty Images) Texas has spent years tweaking its electric grid, but it’s still not fixed. How do we know this? ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, projects an 80% likelihood of rolling blackouts if a storm the magnitude of Winter Storm Uri hits the state this winter. Prior to Uri in February 2021, the probability of rolling blackouts was only 5%. A weaker storm—equivalent to 2022’s Winter Storm Elliott—has a 50% probability of triggering rolling blackouts. And there is no assurance that rolling blackouts can be executed, risking a widescale grid failure. So, by ERCOT’s own projections, the grid is more fragile than it was four years ago. Why? In 2002, Texas dispensed with a reliable end-to-end electricity supply chain that the consumer could count on in the heat of summer and cold of winter. It has been replaced by a 100% government operated grid under which consumers pay more, get less, and no one can be held accountable. Since 2021, electricity demand has continued to grow, and while supply from renewable resources and batteries has grown too, it cannot match demand at night. There are not enough natural gas, coal, and nuclear power plants, along with long duration batteries, to keep Texans warm during long, very cold winter nights. While some in Austin blame this problem on federal subsidies tilting the playing field towards renewable energy, the facts tell a different story. First, years before wind and solar farms proliferated in Texas, the ERCOT market design did not reward capital investment by power plant operators. Second, ERCOT is “an arm of the state,” according to the state’s highest court. ERCOT, not the federal government, controls entry to its grid. So, if wind and solar farms are a problem, they are a problem because the state let them become a problem. Finally, the state of Texas rewards gaming by allowing extreme price gouging, which has cost Texans billions of dollars. The questions for the Texas Legislature start with, Who do you work for? The billionaire energy oligarchs or 30 million Texans? If the ERCOT grid fails again, how will you react to a federal takeover in the name of national security by President Trump? Of all the states that are critical to the national economy and national security, Texas is at the top of the list. What’s the cost to date? In 2021, both The Wall Street Journal and KPRC-2 television in Houston reported that ERCOT consumers had paid $28 billion more than they would have been expected to pay had the market remained a cost-of-service plus allowable return on investment for the utilities—a system that allowed power generators to be paid for investing in maintenance and new generating capacity. Instead, the system encourages generators to hold back power from the grid until tight conditions force wholesale prices to rise, sometimes dramatically, with consumers paying the price. During the five-day February 2021 freeze, spiraling wholesale prices led ERCOT to overcharge its customers by more than $4.2 billion. In 2023, the ERCOT Independent Market Monitor stated that ERCOT overcharged the consumer side of the market by $12 billion from June through December, 2023. No new power plants have been built in exchange for this $12 billion. That money went to executive bonuses and stock buybacks. Who is responsible? ERCOT was named a defendant in hundreds of lawsuits filed following Winter Storm Uri. The Texas Supreme Court ruled that ERCOT is immune from lawsuits under the doctrine of sovereign immunity because—in carefully chosen language echoing that of the Soviet Union—ERCOT is “an arm of the state.” Utilities and power plant owners have been dismissed as defendants after arguing that ERCOT failed, or that other power plants failed, or that natural gas supplies failed, and that because the state manages everything about the ERCOT grid, these individual utilities and power plant owners bore no responsibility. It was an easy argument. None of the generators are responsible to individual customers because they only provide electricity to ERCOT. If the electricity was not delivered to consumers, therefore, it was the fault of the state of Texas. The Third Court of Appeals overturned the February 2021 overcharge. But, in a move that has never happened anywhere else in the United States, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, PUCT, at the direction of Gov. Greg Abbott, went to court to make sure that consumers had to pay the overcharge. ERCOT is not a “deregulated” market Following a deadly freeze in 2011, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission spoke up, stating that “…shedding load in the winter places lives and property at risk.” In response, Texas did nothing to change things. In 2013, my colleague Paul MacAvoy and I detailed the design flaws of the ERCOT electricity market and noted that it would inevitably fail because electricity suppliers could not earn a return on capital investment. The state, however, persisted with ERCOT’s anticapitalistic design and daily operation. No one can claim the ERCOT market is deregulated when it is 100% operated by the state of Texas. Every day, ERCOT is the one buyer in the wholesale market, operating like any other government agency buying pencils and office chairs. It is also the one seller in the wholesale market, raking its fees off the top, and billing retailers for electricity daily. Consumers do not interact directly with the wholesale market. They must buy electricity through PUCT-licensed retailers, who do not own power plants and who are not required to have electricity supplies lined up to service their customers. This contrasts with the old days in Texas when a consumer bought electricity from a vertically integrated utility, and the PUCT made sure that the utility had the electricity generation capacity available to meet the demands of new customers. The utility and the PUCT worked together to make sure that the utility was making the necessary investments. But today, retailers can sign up customers willy-nilly, without knowing whether there is sufficient supply capacity in ERCOT. With more people moving to Texas and a growing economy, and the increased risk of winter blackouts in ERCOT, electricity retailers are selling empty promises. They are running a Ponzi scheme because they can do so without any consequences. If they come up short like they did in 2021, the state will bail them out. Read that as private profit and socialized costs. Apart from selling something they don’t own, the retailers also make money by offering a confusing myriad of plans in full view of their competitors (see the PUCT’s website PowerToChoose.org). They publish their prices much like the airlines do on reservation services or gasoline stations along the road. While some may call this competition, it is remarkably easy for them to collude. The proposed solution fails on many levels The state has proposed solutions, including the adoption by ERCOT and the PUCT of an untried plan called a “Performance Credit Mechanism,” intended to compensate generators for providing electricity during tight market conditions. The plan, which has a hard cap on the payments, requires retailers to contract with generators. This approach using contracts attempts to reconstitute the vertically integrated utilities. But Texas had already thrown in the towel on its market design by allowing generator companies to acquire retailers such as NRG owning Reliant Energy. The PCM can only work if there is sufficient capacity for peak demand periods and there is 100% compliance across ERCOT. Neither of these requirements exist today. ERCOT’s antiquated portfolio of coal and natural gas power plants virtually guarantees that supply will be short as ERCOT’s rate of unplanned power plant outages is the highest in the nation. And the incentive for power plant operators to withhold electricity to drive the wholesale price from 5-cents per kilowatt hour to $5 per kilowatt hour is too great. As one power plant operator admitted on social media: “Ed, with prices you need to withhold. We have supply and demand functioning well. Get rewarded for being on during peak times.” Texas consumers should beg to differ. Texas government ignores the easy solutions The first, best solution following the 2021 freeze was to build new natural gas power plants. Even the state of California commissioned new natural gas power plants in 2020 after power supplies in that state ran short. Texas state government turned down offers from Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Starwood Energy Capital that, for approximately $10 billion, would have added up to 10,000 megawatts of new capacity—not for free of course, the companies asked for a 9 percent rate of return. Those power plants would have been operating today. No one will build new natural gas power plants for ERCOT without making sure a rate of return is available. BlackRock rebuffed pleas by Gov. Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick to invest $10 billion in new power plants last March. To illustrate the investment thesis, CPS, the city of San Antonio’s municipal utility, was able to buy two relatively new natural gas power plants for approximately 50% of the new build cost. It follows that BlackRock is not going to invest $10 billion just to have something that is worth $5 billion. Low interest loans from the Texas Energy Fund cannot overcome the lack of equity investment for new power plants. Incumbent power plants will ask for loans to extend the operating lives of their old coal and natural gas power plants, but that does not expand supply. The second fast fix has always been a systemwide demand response program, where ERCOT would pay consumers to reduce electricity use during periods of peak demand. ERCOT already does this for cryptocurrency miners, paying them to reduce power use when the grid is strained. But regular Texans have had smart meters in their homes and businesses for more than 10 years. The technology is proven. During the summer of 2022, California sent out texts requesting that consumers opt-out on peak afternoons. More than one million did—and they did it without getting anything in exchange. Why has the Texas government not adopted demand response for consumers after all this time? Doing so would lessen the wild volatility in electricity prices, which range as high as $5 per kilowatt hour wholesale. It also would cut into profitability for generators and commodities traders who play against consumers during tight supply days. Millions of Texans could save billions on their electric bills if just a few hundred thousand customers opt out during peak demand for cheap side payments. Texas government preys on its citizens It’s not Republican vs. Democrat. Democrats run the states of California and New York, where there are dysfunctional grids. But the Republicans in charge of Texas have made it clear they do not care about the voter or consumer. That should change by 2026. Polling from the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin shows that grid reliability is a top concern of Texas voters. Texas replaced its reliable end-to-end electricity supply chain with a severely fragmented system that is 100% government operated. No one can be held accountable. It is exactly like a government bureau out of the old Soviet Union down to its antiquated, computer driven input-output algorithm. Imagine that. One can forgive journalists, engineers, and lobbyists for not appreciating the irony, but the elected leaders of Texas should have learned about comparative government and economic systems in high school and college. Texas “deregulation” replaced government oversight of a capitalist driven electricity supply chain with direct government control. Beyond those structural problems, other factors are driving up electric bills for Texans. The addition of solar and wind farms brings needed new capacity but also requires an extensive buildout of transmission facilities to bring that electricity from rural areas to the state’s urban centers. Local utilities such as Austin Energy and CenterPoint Energy are also adding cleanup costs from storms and further costs necessary to harden their local distribution infrastructure to customers’ bills. President-elect Donald Trump has often called high energy prices a tax on living, and by that measure, the Texas ERCOT market leads the nation in taxing life. Trump has pledged to cut electricity rates by 50% during his first 18 months in office, but he will not be able to change anything in Texas because the ERCOT grid is not subject to federal oversight or regulation.

They also awaited new U.S. inflation data set for release this week. The S&P 500 lost 0.3% to end at 6,034.91, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25% to 19,687.24. Both indexes booked back-to-back losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined for a fourth day, sliding 154.10 points, or 0.35%, to 44,247.83. Oracle shares slumped 6.7% after the database software company posted fiscal second-quarter results that missed Wall Street's estimates. The stock has jumped around 68% this year. "[The market] has been narrowing over the past week," CFRA Research's chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said to CNBC. "Investors are waiting to see if that simply is your traditional seasonal softness in mid-December, and I think [they] are expecting the participation to broaden out once again as the market does indeed go through an end-of-year pop." Alphabet was a breakout winner of the session, advancing 5.6%, on the back of Google making a major breakthrough in quantum computing with the unveiling of its new chip. That puts its year-to-date gains at more than 32%. This comes after the major averages fell on Monday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid about 0.6%, dropping from recent records as shares of Nvidia declined. Shares of the chip giant were more than 2% lower Tuesday, extending losses seen in the previous session after a Chinese regulator said it was investigating the company for possibly violating the country's antimonopoly law. By contrast, Meta Platforms, which also saw losses on Monday, was up 1% Tuesday. Investors are now waiting on the U.S. consumer price index report, which is due Wednesday and could influence how the Federal Reserve proceeds on interest rates at its Dec. 17-18 meeting. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast that headline inflation rose 0.3% in November and 2.7% over the prior 12 months. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 154.10 points, or 0.35%, to finish at 44,247.83 on Tuesday. The broad market S&P 500 also fell 0.3% to settle at 6,034.91, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.25% to finish at 19,687.24. — Sean Conlon U.S. Steel shares plunged late Tuesday afternoon on a report that President Joe Biden plans to block the company's acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel later this month. U.S. Steel stock was briefly halted due to volatility. The company's shares were down more than 9% after trading resumed. People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Biden will block the $14.1 billion sale once the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States submits its review to him by Dec. 22 or Dec. 23. — Spencer Kimball Kroger and Albertsons shares moved in opposite directions after a U.S. judge nixed the grocers' planned $25 billion merger. Kroger shares surged 4%, while Albertsons shares tumbled more than 3% and hit a 52-week low. The Biden administration had fought against the deal, arguing the combination would reduce competition and lead to higher prices at the supermarket. However, Kroger pushed back against this argument. Management claimed becoming a larger entity would result in cost savings that could then be passed on to their customers. Kroger shares have outperformed the market this year, with a 32% gain, while Albertsons shares have fallen 22%. — Christina Cheddar Berk President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans may not go into effect for some time, according to Wolfe Research's Stephanie Roth. "We don't expect sweeping tariffs to go into effect until late 2025 — Republicans are reportedly discussing how to potentially leverage tariff revenue in a broader fiscal package, which increases the odds tariffs happen late in 2025 rather than early," the firm's chief economist wrote. If a 10% universal baseline tariff and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods coming into the U.S. were to be implemented, Roth estimates the U.S. economy will be hit up to 1.2% in gross domestic product, and inflation will see a boost of 1.1%. — Sean Conlon The market may likely see more upside over the coming weeks, according to Barclays. "Momentum seems so strong that a continued rally seems the path of least resistance for the rest of 2024," analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha wrote in a note this week. Rajadhyaksha also said bond markets are expected to be "range-bound," given that investors are awaiting more details on President-elect Donald Trump's policies. — Sean Conlon The S&P 500 has had more declining than advancing stocks in each of the last six completed trading days, according to BTIG data. Despite that, it has been a winning period for the broad index in an unusual twist. The S&P 500 is up around 0.3% during that timeframe. There has never been a six-day run with both negative daily breadth and a positive overall return in the past two decades, according to BTIG. — Alex Harring While stocks may be due for more gains in 2025, Citi believes investors should also brace for more volatility given an uncertain policy outlook and raised valuations. "We maintain a positive view on US equities headed into 2025," the firm's U.S. equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote. "Ongoing soft landing and Artificial Intelligence tailwinds now interact with Trump policy promise, and risks. Continued broadening beyond Mega Cap Growth impacts is critical but an extended valuation starting point will be an ongoing hurdle." The strategist has a year-end 2025 base case target for the S&P 500 of 6,500, allowing for gains in the mid-single digits next year. However, his bull case of 6,900 and bear case of 5,100 allow for a broad range of outcomes. "Our bull and bear case assumptions help frame an expectation for increased volatility next year," Chronert continued. — Sean Conlon Oracle shares shed about 8% and are on pace for their worst day since Dec.12, 2023. The decline came on the heels of a disappointing fiscal second-quarter earnings report that fell short of Wall Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines. Oracle also issued a weak current-quarter outlook. The drop in shares comes as Oracle heads for its best year since 1999 as investors snatch up shares of cloud infrastructure players assisting companies with the demand storage needs for artificial intelligence models. — Samantha Subin During Tuesday's trading session, eight stocks in the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. Names that hit this milestone included: On the flip side, just three stocks were trading at their 52-week lows: Baxter, Centene and Teleflex. — Lisa Kailai Han, Christopher Hayes Semiconductor stocks dropped on Tuesday, putting downward pressure on the market. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) and VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) each slid more than 2%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was near flat and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.2%. Among the worst-performing semi stocks was Broadcom, which slid about 4%. Micron and Taiwan Semiconductor also each dropped more than 3%. Notably, artificial intelligence darling Nvidia shed nearly 2%. — Alex Harring Shares of Alphabet rose more than 5% in afternoon trading following Google's breakthrough in quantum computing. The company said its new chip, known as Willow, is able to decrease errors "exponentially" as the amount of qubits, which are considered the units of information in quantum computing, are increased. This "cracks a key challenge in quantum error correction that the field has pursued for almost 30 years," Google also said. The stock's move brings its year-to-date gains to more than 32%. Shares have also risen more than 24% over the past three months. — Sean Conlon The dollar index rose 0.4% Tuesday to 106.58. Against the euro, the dollar gained 0.5%. The euro last traded at 1.05 against the greenback. Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened 0.6% to 152.13 yen, and climbed 0.4% against the won to 1,434.23. In December, the greenback has gained 1.6% and 2.8% against the won and the yen, respectively. — Hakyung Kim Walgreens Boots Alliance shares popped 18% in midday trading, after briefly halting for volatility, following a Wall Street Journal report, citing sources familiar, that said the pharmacy chain is in talks to sell itself to private equity firm Sycamore Partners. The deal could be completed as soon as early next year if talks don't fall apart, the report said. Sycamore Partners declined CNBC's request for comment. The move would take Walgreens off the public market after it was booted off the Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this year. The stock is down 57% in 2024. — Sarah Min Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading: For the full list, read here. — Pia Singh There were just 209 advancers in the S&P 500, with the index itself little changed as investors awaited this week's consumer prices data. Communication services and consumer discretionary were the top-performing sectors, up 2% and 0.8%, respectively. By contrast, real estate stocks slid 1%. Boeing was the No. 1 stock in the broader index, gaining more than 5% after Reuters, citing people familiar, said the company restarted production of its 737 Max jetliner. On the other hand, Super Micro Computer and Oracle were lower by 8% and 7%, respectively. — Sarah Min The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) dipped 0.5% on Tuesday, putting the fund on track for its fourth straight losing session and sixth in the past seven, according to FactSet data. The declines have also come during the session. As Bespoke Investment Group pointed out in a post on social media site X, the RSP has seen intraday declines in six straight sessions. It would need to rally and close above $184.46 to snap that streak on Tuesday. The struggles for the RSP are notable because the equal weight fund can be a proxy for market breadth. While the S&P 500 has become increasingly concentrated in a handful of tech names over the past year, the behavior of the RSP is more indicative of the broader large cap stock universe. — Jesse Pound China-focused exchange-traded funds relinquished some gains on Tuesday, a day after the country promised "more proactive" fiscal stimulus and looser monetary policy. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) and iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) each slid just over 4.5% in late morning trading. The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) also dropped more than 4.5%. Despite those slides, all three funds are still higher compared with where they started the week. That underscores the strength of Monday's rally. — Alex Harring The Trump Trade is already running out of steam, according to Wolfe Research. "Uncertainty in the first half of 2025 should put a damper on the 'Trump Trade,'" the firm's chief investment strategist Chris Senyek wrote Tuesday. "So in the meantime we'd continue to own the Mag 7!" The Trump Trade will have three parts, Senyek wrote, with the first part unwinding in the immediate aftermath of the election. Senyek expects the second part of the trade will likely come in the first 100 days of the president-elect's term. The third, he said, will come in the second half of 2025, as incoming data indicates whether Trump's policy agenda is a positive or negative for economic growth. For now, as the first part of the Trump Trade finishes its course, Senyek said he would stick to the "Magnificent Seven" that are not in the "crosshairs of policy risk" through the first half of 2025. — Sarah Min Shares of Sirius XM slid more than 8% on Tuesday after the radio operator appointed a new chief operating officer and announced cost-cutting initiatives. The firm said it will target an initial incremental $200 million of annualized savings as it exits 2025, citing "marketplace headwinds." The company said it will also move its marketing and other resources away from "high-cost, high-churn audiences in streaming." — Yun Li Stocks were relatively unchanged Tuesday morning. The S&P 500 rose about 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose almost 0.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 88 points, or 0.2%. — Sean Conlon Shares of Alaska Air Group rose nearly 11% in premarket trading on the heels of the carrier raising its fourth-quarter earnings forecast and authorizing a $1 billion stock buyback. The company now expects earnings to come in between 40 cents and 50 cents per share, up from its prior guidance of 20 cents to 40 cents per share. Analysts polled by FactSet were looking for earnings of 49 cents per share for the period. Alaska Air also announced it is going to launch new nonstop flights to Japan and Korea in 2025 as part of its plan to deliver $1 billion in profit by 2027. The stock has outperformed the broader market this year, jumping more than 38% year to date. Shares have also gained around 36% over the past three months. — Sean Conlon, Leslie Josephs Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas appears to be cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the auto industry heading in 2025. "The US election result has extended the 'ICE is Nice' trade for a bit longer but keep on the lookout for hidden value in the EV ecosystem into the 2H. We recommend investors stay nimble and selective given the volatility of policy outcomes," Jonas said in a note to clients on Tuesday. "ICE" stands for internal combustion engine, the traditional alternative to electric vehicles. Morgan Stanley made two changes to its ratings of auto stocks: an upgrade of General Motors to equal weight from underweight, and hiking the price target on Tesla to $400 per share from $310. The new price target is just 2.5% above where Tesla closed on Monday, but the stock is still Jonas' top pick in the industry. Tesla could be a beneficiary from the new Trump administration if change leads to regulatory changes that usher along an autonomous driving future. "If the Trump Administration looks to clear the path for a Federal framework on autonomous vehicles, we believe investors will eventually appreciate that the discussion of AVs is also a discussion about EVs. Among a range of policy tools, we see tariffs as a lever to help accelerate onshoring of enabling technology underpinned by more de-risked supply chain," Jonas said. — Jesse Pound These are the stocks moving the most in premarket trading: Read the full list of stocks moving here. — Lisa Kailai Han Small businesses sentiment popped to its highest level in nearly three and a half years following November's presidential election, the National Federation of Independent Business reported Tuesday. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index hit 101.7 for November, an increase of 8 points and the best reading since June 2021. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had forecast a reading of 94.8. "The election results signal a major shift in economic policy, leading to a surge in optimism among small business owners," said Bill Dunkelberg, the group's chief economist. "Owners are particularly hopeful for tax and regulation policies that favor strong economic growth as well as relief from inflationary pressures. In addition, small business owners are eager to expand their operations." Along with the higher reading for the headline index, the share of business owners expecting a better economy ahead jumped 41 points from October to a net 36%, the highest since June 2020. — Jeff Cox Fears surrounding aluminum packaging company Ball are overstated, according to Mizuho, which believes investors should buy the recent pullback in shares. The firm upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and maintained its $67 price target, which is 16% above where shares closed on Monday. "Despite recent misplaced concerns about pricing and volume, we don't believe earnings are at risk, or that fundamentals have changed. We believe the recent pullback in the shares represents a good buying opportunity and an attractive entry point," analyst Edlain Rodriguez wrote in a Tuesday note. The company shut down around 15% of its manufacturing capacity to account for lower consumer demand post-pandemic. "That capacity closure has better positioned Ball for the medium-term as demand gradually normalizes," Rodriguez said. — Hakyung Kim Nvidia shares were down slightly a day after the chipmaker pulled back on China launching an investigation into the company possibly violating the country's antimonopoly law. The stock was last down 0.3% in the premarket. On Monday, it fell 2.6%, leading to Nvidia's longest losing streak since September. — Fred Imbert Citi believes Broadcom's fiscal fourth-quarter results will top expectations ahead of the company's earnings release on Thursday. Analyst Christopher Danely raised his price target on shares to $205 from $175, implying 14.6% upside potential from Monday's close. Danely also reiterated his buy rating on the stock. Danely estimates Broadcom could report up to $15 billion in sales, or a 7% rise from the previous quarter. The company's non-AI semiconductor business will likely drive its better-than-consensus results, he added. Current-quarter guidance could be held back on a slowdown in orders from Google, a leading AI customer, Danely said. "We do expect business to ramp from Meta throughout C25 and pick up the slack," Danely wrote in a Tuesday note. — Hakyung Kim South Korean markets led gains in Asia on Tuesday, with the country's blue-chip Kospi surging 2.43% and seeing its best day in almost three months, while the small-cap Kosdaq spiked 5.52%. That comes as the country continues to grapple with the fallout of President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law declaration. Other markets in Asia also climbed, with Japan's Nikkei 225 up 0.53% and mainland China's CSI 300 rising by 0.73%. — Lim Hui Jie European stocks opened lower on Tuesday, as investors reacted to Chinese import and export figures that came in below expectations in November. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was 0.25% lower shortly after the opening bell, with all major bourses trading in negative territory.

Title: Is NextEra Energy (NEE) the Best Wind Power and Solar Stock to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Wind Power and Solar Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against other best wind power and stocks to invest in now. According to a report by the World Economic Forum published on November 8, the US election result is expected to have a significant impact on the transition to renewable energy sources. Solar and wind energy stocks fell sharply following the election, as Donald Trump's victory is anticipated to have a negative short-term impact on current climate policies. The president-elect has proposed policies that include increasing natural gas pipelines, ending offshore wind energy projects, and boosting fossil fuel production by easing restrictions on drilling on federal lands. He has also expressed intentions to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement and to support nuclear energy production. Despite these challenges, analysts predict that the boom in renewable energy in the US is unlikely to be dramatically slowed. The Inflation Reduction Act passed during the outgoing administration, is expected to inject $1 trillion of spending into green energy, with estimates that 85% of the money has gone to districts that elected Republicans. This financial support, along with existing opposition to the curtailment of renewable energy, suggests that the long-term trajectory of the energy transition remains uncertain but potentially resilient. READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts and 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now. In an interview with CNBC on November 13, Will Rhind, CEO of GraniteShares, discussed the potential implications of a Trump presidency on renewable energy such as wind and solar. Rhind noted that the playbook on energy policy was already seen in the previous Trump administration. The Trump administration has historically been more supportive of fossil fuels and less focused on renewable energy. Therefore, stocks and sectors favored by the Biden administration, such as solar and wind, might see a downturn. Rhind suggested that the overall narrative may seem like it's shifting back toward traditional energy sources. However, Elon Musk seems to be playing an integral role in the Trump administration, and he has been a proponent of climate policies, with his electric vehicle (EV) industry and other businesses, which suggests that energy transition policies may not be as impactful as some might expect today. While the outcome of the US election and the anticipated policies of the new administration pose short-term challenges to renewable energy, the long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic. To compile our list of the 10 best wind power and solar stocks to invest in now, we used clean energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 20 wind and solar energy stocks. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Title: Why Mueller Industries (MLI) Is Among the Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mueller-industries-mli-among-215147055.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MLI) stands against the other best debt free stocks that pay dividends. Debt financing is not inherently negative; its impact largely depends on how effectively it is utilized. When managed properly, it can drive substantial cash flow and enhance returns for shareholders. However, poor management of debt can weaken a company’s financial stability. In the second quarter, corporate debt levels decreased despite benchmark interest rates remaining unchanged between April and June. Total debt for both investment-grade and non-investment-grade companies fell to $8.432 trillion, down from $8.517 trillion in the previous quarter. Investment-grade companies reduced their debt by approximately 0.9% to $6.610 trillion, while those rated below BBB- by S&P Global Ratings lowered their debt by about 1.2% to $1.822 trillion, based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. READ ALSO: 10 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 3 Years The S&P Global report also highlighted that while total debt among U.S. investment-grade companies declined overall, seven out of 10 nonfinancial sectors experienced debt growth in the second quarter. The energy sector recorded the largest increase, with total debt rising by 4.1% to $502.03 billion. However, this increase was largely offset by a significant 12.7% drop, equivalent to $98.87 billion, in debt within the information technology sector. For non-investment-grade companies, debt decreased across eight of the 10 sectors, with consumer staples experiencing the steepest decline at 7.7%. Conversely, total debt rose only in the healthcare and energy sectors within this category. While many US companies maintain strong balance sheets, a significant share of defaults has come from low-rated firms with negative cash flow, high debt levels, and limited liquidity. These heavily indebted businesses, often referred to as “zombies,” struggle to stay afloat, barely covering their loan interest payments, and are vulnerable to even minor setbacks. An analysis by the Associated Press found that nearly 7,000 publicly traded companies globally, including 2,000 in the U.S., fall into this category. These firms were impacted by years of accumulating inexpensive debt, followed by persistent inflation that pushed borrowing costs to their highest levels in a decade. Additionally, much of the borrowed funds were not directed toward growth initiatives like expansion, hiring, or technological investment but were instead used for stock buybacks. Financial analysts have pointed out that U.S. companies have not taken sufficient steps to reduce their long-term debt, leading to a worsening situation. For the first time, annual interest expenses have exceeded $1 trillion, reaching $1.16 trillion in 2024. According to a Treasury official, the average interest rate on government debt increased to 3.32% in 2024, compared to 2.97% the previous year. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt, currently near 100% of GDP, will climb to 122% by 2034. Using debt to support dividends is typically viewed unfavorably, especially in light of practices observed during the 2020 pandemic. At that time, many private companies turned to dividend recapitalization, borrowing funds to maintain dividend payouts. The trend persisted in 2024 as well. As of September 30, 2024, US companies, including those not supported by private equity, have secured a record $70.2 billion in leveraged loans for dividend recapitalizations, based on data from PitchBook. This amount surpasses the $67.2 billion recorded in 2021, the previous high point for such activity. That said, many companies have maintained stable balance sheets, with US firms consistently setting new records for dividend payments year after year. A worker welding a pipe joint in a metal fabrication facility. To create this list, we first used a screener and identified companies with minimal or no debt. From this pool, we selected those that consistently pay dividends to shareholders and compared their enterprise value (EV) to their market capitalization to gauge which ones are debt-free. We then narrowed down the list by including stocks that had sustainable dividend yields. From that list, we picked 8 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27 Market Cap as of December 7: $8.95 billion Enterprise Value as of December 7: $8.02 billion Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MLI) ranks second on our list of the best debt free stocks that pay dividends. The American machinery industry company manufactures a wide range of products for industrial markets. The company has attracted investors' interest due to strong operational improvements, favorable market conditions, and its undervalued position relative to competitors. MLI, a leader in essential but often overlooked markets, produces basic components for water infrastructure, HVAC, and industrial applications. The company benefits from a well-balanced business model, with its piping systems segment contributing the majority of its operational profits and revenues. The stock is up nearly 69% YTD. In the third quarter of 2024, Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MLI) posted revenues of $997.8 million, which jumped by 21.7% from the same period last year. The company's operating income came in at $206.7 million, up from $181 million in the prior-year period. The rise in net sales was driven by $102.4 million in sales from recently acquired businesses, along with the increase in copper prices. Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MLI) has been growing its dividends for the past four years. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.02%, as of December 7. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 27 funds owned stakes in Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MLI), up from 25 in the previous quarter. The overall value of these stakes is more than $424.7 million. Among these hedge funds, GAMCO Investors was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall, MLI ranks 2nd on our list of the best debt free stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for MLI to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MLI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Ways To Invest In Tesla Beyond Buying TSLA Stock

© 2024 Bloomberg Finance LP Tesla (TSLA) is one of the most closely followed and debated stocks. That’s what happens when you create a new industry (electric vehicles) and trade in a price range from $100 to $400, and back to $100 again, all within a few years time. And let’s not forget the emergence of Tesla founder Elon Musk on the political front. All this may lead investors to wonder how best to get exposure to Tesla stock, other than buying it directly. That’s where exchange-traded funds can represent a wide range of “access points” for different types of objectives. Popular indexes like the S&P 500 have ETFs that allow investors to profit from its declines, to earn extra income from it via option positions, and to add leverage. More recently, allowing investors to put those types of enhancements around individual stocks has been a priority for some ETF product creators. But in the case of Tesla, we might just have the widest array of choices for how to “drive” your profits forward. Here are seven I picked out, and how I’d potentially use them. Note that these are my own observations and research. They are not recommendations, simply a way to expand the range of what is possible for investors who don’t drill down on this as I have been doing for decades. Do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.

AMZN is 22% and Home Depot (HD) checks in at 8%. So nearly half of XLY is in these three stocks. XLY has $24.3 billion in assets under management and a low expense ratio of 0.09%. I want to own Tesla but with some diversification around it. This is one way in which my approach to ETF investing is likely very different from most. I like concentrated funds, since it allows me to zero in on a smaller basket of names that at times are really all I want from that market segment. I don't need a piece of 93 stocks in a single sector! This is for investors who prefer to reduce the risk of any single stock. The focus of this ETF is long-term growth of capital achieved by investing in companies that benefit from the development of new products and technologies, such as autonomous mobility, intelligent devices, adaptive robotics, neural networks, reusable rockets and advanced batteries. Tesla is ARKQ’s top holding (17% of assets). ARKQ has total assets of $968 million and an expense ratio of 0.75%. Complements TSLA exposure with allocations to defense, cybersecurity and space exploration. Volatility. Made a big “round trip” in price the past three years, losing 50% and then gaining 100% to net out to a break-even over that period. I want to own TSLA and other autonomous tech stocks, but not Amazon. This is also a diversification move around Tesla stock, though using a thematic group of stocks instead of just those in the same consumer discretionary sector. This is TSLA times 2, though it is not always that simple. As with all ETFs that, like this one, employ leverage, the concept of making 2x the gain or loss of TSLA should be assumed to only be good on a daily basis.Still when TSLA goes on one of those manic upside runs, 2x is an attractive consideration to me. TSLL has an expense ratio of 0.96%. “All bulled up” on Tesla, with potential to make twice as much as owning the regular common stock. What Tesla giveth twice as much, it also taketh away twice as much. Since I'm a chartist at the core, I can decide to buy a good TSLA chart or buy a good TSLL chart with half the assets at risk. This ETF might appeal to those who are comfortable with leverage, pursuing twice the gain with twice the risk. Leveraged ETFs are a relatively new creation. Single inverse ETFs have been around since 2006. And that means I've been using them liberally for 18 years. The ones that move opposite major market indexes have been a "go-to" for me as an offense-defense investor since prior to the global financial crisis. Newer on the scene are single stock inverse ETFs, such as the ones offered by Direxion, T-Rex and other fund firms. Again, the daily objective means that longer time periods often will not be the mirror image of the underlying "long" stock performance. TSLS has an expense ratio of 1.07%. Efficient way to essentially “short” TSLA, on a 1:1 daily basis. Investors tend to undereducate themselves on the “math of investment loss.” In other words, if TSLA goes up 20% as it has done in short time periods many times, this would drop approximately 20%. But that means you need to make 25% just to get back to even, not 20%. When I think TSLA is overpriced short-to-intermediate term, and want to try to profit from a potential decline of some magnitude. TSLS could appeal to those who wish to try to profit from a decline in TSLA. Note that big “round trip” move I noted at the start of this article.

That would not have worked well if held throughout 2024. But don't be fooled by that full-year summary. During the course of this, its first full year of existence, TSLZ has had 1-month up moves of 80%, 50% and 30%. These are tactical vehicles, period. Potentially a “cleaner” way to try to capitalize on declines in Tesla stock than using put options. That’s because TSLA is so volatile, buying options can be very expensive. I own TSLA but am concerned about its near-term price picture, so I can consider this to hedge some of that, and try to avoid the full downside risk. Or, I can use this to try to profit from the next major dip in TSLA. For those who don’t just think the stock will fall, but do so quickly, this ETF, like other inverse funds, aims to be held for short time periods. This is another in the series from YieldMax ETFs that I've written about here recently. TSLY aims to deliver a very high income return and a total return of about 80% of the ups and downs of TSLA stock. TSLY has total assets of $1.0 billion and an expense ratio of 1.0% Big income payout, aims to capture about 80% of up moves in TSLA on a total return basis. Tends to track about 80% of the downside in the stock. Bullish on TSLA but prefer to earn more of my total return as income, with some upside potential beyond that. This relatively new ETF might appeal to those who want to ride along with Tesla, but exchange some potential capital appreciation for current income. Finally, another one from YieldMax, but a departure from their core product line. This fund, which has an expense ratio of 0.99%, started trading in May, so I'll use this directly from the fund management firm: YieldMax Short TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF is an actively managed ETF that seeks to generate monthly income from a synthetic covered put strategy on TSLA, while providing indirect short exposure to the share price of TSLA. CRSH seeks to benefit when the TSLA share price decreases, however CRSH’s potential corresponding benefit from decreases in the TSLA share price is limited. CRSH seeks to manage potential losses (i.e., cap losses if the TSLA share price experiences significant gains) by purchasing OTM call options. Big income payout. This brand new ETF is only for the very bold, and who are bearish on Tesla stock. It produces a high income level, but declined more than 40% of its price during its first six months in existence. The good news on TSLA: it has more than doubled since last spring. The bad news on TSLA: that giant move brought it back to where it traded about three years ago. I'm no fan of "dead money” (old Wall Street term) especially when it comes in the form of a political football, which was halfway to a meme stock even before the founder ended up in a potentially influential quasi-government position. There's a lot to consider here, and this story is much more complex than a lot of places I can decide to put my money. Knowing that these ETFs exist is step one. Understanding them is step two. Determining how to use them, when to use them and how to avoid getting burned from anything related to Tesla's volatile underlying stock price movement is all part of the "next level" of learning how to design portfolios for modern markets.

Title: AMD downgraded after BI report on weak demand for its AI chips among AWS customers

Time Published: 2024-12-09T21:20:51Z

Bank of America downgraded AMD after a Business Insider report raised concerns about demand for the tech company's AI chips. Analysts at BofA cut AMD shares to a "neutral," citing "higher competitive risk" in the AI market, according to an analyst note published on Monday. BofA analysts also lowered their AMD GPU sales forecast for next year to $8 billion, from $8.9 billion, implying a roughly 4% market share. AMD's stock dropped roughly 5.6% on Monday, after falling about 2% on Friday. Its shares are down about 5% so far this year. The declines follow BI's report on Friday that said Amazon Web Services was "not yet" seeing strong enough customer demand to deploy AMD's AI chips through its cloud platform. Bank of America cited this AWS customer-demand issue, alongside Nvidia's dominance and the growing preference for custom chips from Marvell and Broadcom, as factors limiting AMD's growth potential. "Recently largest cloud customer Amazon strongly indicated its preference for alternative custom (Trainium/ MRVL) and NVDA products, but a lack of strong demand for AMD," the Bank of America note said, referring to AWS's in-house AI chip Trainium and its close partnerships with Marvell and Nvidia. Spokespeople from Amazon and AMD declined to comment on the story last week. After publication of both articles, the companies got back in touch with BI and shared comments. In an email to BI, AMD's spokesperson said it has a "great relationship" with AWS. "We are actively engaged with AWS and end customers on AI opportunities," the spokesperson said. AWS's spokesperson said in an email to BI, "AWS and AMD work together closely, as we continue to make AWS the best place to run AMD silicon. Based on the success of AMD CPUs on AWS, we are actively looking at offering AMD's AI chips." AMD recently increased its GPU sales forecast, just a year after launching its line of AI chips. But its GPU market share is still far behind Nvidia's. Bank of America said AMD could still succeed in the AI chip market, in part due to Nvidia's supply constraints and premium pricing, making it a strong alternative, especially for internal cloud workloads. It also said AMD is well positioned in the server chip market, as rival Intel continues to struggle. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip?

Title: Why Tesla (TSLA) Is Among the Best Autonomous Driving Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other best autonomous driving stocks to buy. The vision of fleets of driverless cars seamlessly transporting passengers has captivated consumers and driven billions in investment over recent years. Imagine summoning a driverless car with a tap on your phone, enjoying a stress-free, congestion-free commute. After years of anticipation and extensive development, self-driving car technology is finally becoming a reality. Vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) and partial self-driving capabilities are now hitting the market, signaling the start of the race toward full autonomy. Simultaneously, the robotaxi market is maturing, with commercial driverless services now active across the U.S. and China. Leading players in this space collectively operate over 2,000 robotaxis, gathering data to refine AI systems, ensuring safety, and serving mobility-as-a-service customers. According to IDTechEx, the autonomous vehicles market is poised for rapid growth, with projections indicating robotaxi vehicle sales could reach $174 billion by 2045, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% starting in 2025. According to a 2021 McKinsey survey, consumers are eager for autonomous driving (AD) features and willing to pay a premium. Ranked from Level 0-5 based on capabilities, growing demand for these systems could unlock billions in revenue. While vehicles equipped with Level 2 autonomy are widely known, the firm projects that widespread adoption of vehicles equipped with Level 4 capabilities will begin around 2026, with initial applications expected to focus on autonomous parking, with highway driving following shortly thereafter. Overall, McKinsey projects that the ADAS and AD market for passenger cars could generate $300 billion to $400 billion by 2035. The firm also highlights the far-reaching impact autonomous vehicles could have on various industries. For instance, by significantly reducing car accidents, advanced driver technology could lower the demand for roadside assistance and vehicle repairs, potentially challenging businesses in those sectors as adoption increases. Additionally, self-driving cars may eliminate the need for high insurance premiums, as liability for accidents could shift away from individual drivers. This could pave the way for new business-to-business insurance models tailored to autonomous travel. Adding momentum, Bloomberg reports that President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team plans to prioritize a federal framework for self-driving vehicles within the Transportation Department. Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles annually under exemptions. However, broader adoption of autonomous vehicles will likely require congressional action to establish comprehensive guidelines. Grayson Brulte, founder of The Road to Autonomy, a data and analysis firm specializing in self-driving technology, remarked: “The companies want clarity on vehicles with no pedals and no steering wheel. There could be a fight over this, but if a federal framework is implemented, it could usher in the autonomy economy.” Additionally, if new regulations permit the broader deployment of vehicles without human controls, it could significantly benefit Elon Musk. Musk, who has become an influential figure within the president-elect’s inner circle, has staked the EV maker's future on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence. During his company’s recent quarterly earnings call, Musk expressed his intention to advocate for a streamlined federal approval process for autonomous vehicles, leveraging his position within the Trump administration to advance the regulatory framework for AV adoption. 25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024 In this article, we examined screeners and ETFs to identify leading companies actively engaged in the autonomous vehicle market. We ranked the top 10 stocks in ascending order based on hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Overall, TSLA ranks 4th on our list of best autonomous driving stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: China Probes Nvidia Amid Escalating A.I. Chip Tensions With US: What to Know

Just two weeks after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang lauded China’s contributions to A.I. research in Hong Kong, the Chinese government has launched an antitrust investigation into the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company amid escalating geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and uncertainties around the incoming Trump administration.

You can opt out anytime. China’s State Administration of Market Regulation is looking into Nvidia’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, an Israeli company that makes computer networking equipment, Chinese media reported today (Dec. 9). China approved Nvidia’s $6.9 billion purchase of Mellanox under the condition that the Israeli company would provide samples of new products to rivals within 90 days of making them available to Nvidia, according to Bloomberg, which noted that China’s approval was needed due to the size of its economy and semiconductor market. The deal also received merger control approval from authorities in the U.S., Israel, Mexico and the European Union. In a statement to Observer, Nvidia said it is happy to answer any questions regulators have about its business. “Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” said the chipmaker. “We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business.” The investigation is the latest jab in an escalating semiconductor battle between the U.S. and China, which was described by China’s Commerce Ministry as an “abuse of control measures” and a “typical act of economic coercion.” Earlier this month, the Biden administration enacted another round of chip export controls in the country, following previous efforts to curb China’s access to advanced A.I. chips. The country retaliated by banning the export of gallium, germanium, antimony and other superhard materials to the U.S. These materials have various high-tech and military applications. Previous measures from the U.S. have limited Nvidia from selling advanced GPUs to China since 2022. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to maintain these measures and the Biden administration’s tough-on-China stance. Nvidia shares fell more than 3 percent today in response to the news. The past year has been lucrative for the chipmaker, which has seen its stock surging by nearly 200 percent to claim a market cap of $3.38 trillion, making it the world’s second most valuable company behind Apple (AAPL) and boosting the wealth of its founder and CEO to an estimated $120.5 billion. Surging demand for the GPUs underpinning A.I. applications has propelled Nvidia to become the industry leader in A.I. chips, with a 70 percent to 95 percent share of the market, according to Mizuho Securities. The chipmaker, which reported a 94 percent jump in revenue year-over-year to $35 billion during the last quarter, counts tech giants like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) among its largest clients. In China, however, Nvidia has lost ground amid tough export controls. Its sales in the country made up 15 percent of its total sales in the quarter ended September, a dip from 26 percent a year ago. Huang himself has urged for a positive relationship between the U.S. and China when it comes to technological advances, lauding China’s contributions to A.I. research. “Open research is one of the miracles of modern science and perhaps the ultimate form of global cooperation—one that we must protect,” the CEO said while receiving an honorary doctorate from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology last month.

Title: China levels anti-trust charges against Nvidia – country accuses chipmaker of violating anti-monopoly regulations, examining the $7 billion Mellanox acquisition

Nvidia's stock dipped by 2% as news broke this morning. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As the trade wars escalate between the US and China, Nvidia has found itself in the crossfire following accusations of possible anti-trust violations by the Chinese Government – per local media. The spotlight is on Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox – a conditional approval of which was granted, provided Nvidia would follow strict anti-monopoly guidelines. Following similar inquiries by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) a few months back, Nvidia is now taking flak from both sides. The probe scrutinizes Team Green’s purchase of the Israeli-American networking firm Mellanox in 2020. Mellanox is the backbone of Nvidia's AI servers, allowing multiple GPUs within a DGX system to be connected via InfiniBand and Ethernet switches. The $7 billion acquisition was approved by Chinese authorities, stipulating that Nvidia will not use this partnership to discriminate against domestic firms. Likewise, Nvidia was obligated to notify rivals about upcoming products within 90 days. Coming hot on the heels of another wave of sanctions on 140 Chinese companies—now prohibited from importing High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) among other chip-making tools—a retaliatory response was expected. This appears to be part of China’s strategy to fight back against US sanctions, with recent reports suggesting a 20% price cut on domestic goods to counteract Trump’s tariffs. When asked to comment on the matter by PCMag, Nvidia said, "Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." Since the news broke, Nvidia's stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) plummeted by 2% in pre-market trading early in the morning. These regulations are not mere formalities, as evidenced by their impacts on many multi-trillion dollar corporations.

Title: Nvidia stock falls almost 3% as it faces an antitrust probe in China

Nvidia’s (NVDA-2.69%) shares fell by almost 3% during mid-day trading on Monday after the Chinese government announced an investigation into the chipmaker. Fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-2.36%) and Marvell (MRVL-0.37%) also saw their shares fall by 4.4% and 5.2%, respectively. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said on Monday it has launched an investigation into the U.S.-based chipmaker for possibly violating anti-monopoly laws with its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, according to China Central Television. Nvidia bought the chip designer for $6.9 billion in 2020 and was given conditional approval by Chinese authorities that included a requirement to not bundle or tie together its products with Mellanox. The two chip companies were also required to continue supplying on fair terms and to make sure technology was compatible with chips manufactured by Chinese firms. Other measures were designed to address tightening U.S. export controls targeting China’s chip firms. In September, Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT-0.64%) were accused by Texas-based startup Xockets of monopolistic practices, patent infringement, and violating federal antitrust laws. The lawsuit alleges that Nvidia has infringed on Xockets’ patents since its acquisition of Mellanox, which had adopted the startup’s technology in 2016 without its knowledge or permission. The lawsuit accuses Nvidia and Microsoft of infringing on Xockets’ patent for advanced data processing units, or DPUs, “that enable accelerated computing and artificial intelligence” in data centers. Meanwhile, the Biden administration recently announced more restrictions on the sale of high-bandwidth memory and chipmaking tools to China, including tools produced by U.S. companies abroad. The new rules include controls on 24 types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, as well as on three types of software tools that can be used to develop or produce chips, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said. Another 140 unnamed Chinese entities — including semiconductor fabs, tool companies, and investment firms — accused of working on behalf of the Chinese government were also added to the U.S. trade blacklist.

Title: There are 2 problems with Warren Buffett's stock market valuation indicator
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-stock-market-valuation-indicator-tech-gdp-berkshire-hathaway-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-09T16:45:11Z

With the stock market trading at record highs, Warren Buffett's favorite valuation indicator is also hitting new peaks. The Buffett Indicator, which measures the total market capitalization of US stocks relative to US GDP, hit an all-time peak of about 209% on Monday, surpassing the record high of 200% reached in August 2021. In other words, the US stock market's total market cap of about $61 trillion, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 index, is more than double the annualized US GDP of about $29 trillion. Bearish investors have been quick to point to the Buffett Indicator as yet another signal that the stock market is significantly overvalued and due for a correction. Yet, research from Morgan Stanley suggests the gauge may not be the best valuation tool to follow. Michael Mauboussin of Morgan Stanley's Counterpoint Globlal highlighted two flaws in the famed Buffett Indicator, which Buffett introduced in a 2001 Forbes article. "The first is that U.S. companies now get more of their sales from outside the U.S. than they did in past decades. GDP does not include those sales. That means the numerator, market capitalization, reflects a larger addressable market than what the denominator, GDP, captures," Mauboussin said. The gauge's failure to capture foreign sales is a big deal, considering that about 40% of revenues derived from S&P 500 companies come from international markets. If those revenues were encapsulated in US GDP, then the Buffett Indicator wouldn't be flashing as big of a warning sign as it is today. The second flaw concerns the idea that the economy today is much different than it was in past eras. "Second, GDP is arguably understated because it fails to measure accurately the quality of goods and services as well as the value of new goods and services. The rise of digitalization makes measurement today more challenging than in the past," Mauboussin said. Whereas the GDP-based stock market valuation indicator may have proven more accurate decades ago, when manufacturing was a bigger part of America's economy, that's not the case today. Research from BlackRock and economist David Rosenberg recently has echoed this thinking. "The equity market's changing sectoral composition reflects the transformation taking hold. So, comparing today's index to that of the past is like comparing apples to oranges," BlackRock said last week. Rosenberg, meanwhile, said last week he has recalibrated his long-standing bearish view due to the evolving nature of America's tech-focused economy. Mauboussin's broad conclusion from his analysis of the Buffett ratio is that valuation measures that worked well in the past might not be suited to the current market. "As with most measures, we need to be careful using it when we compare the present to the past," Mauboussin said. For what it's worth, Buffett himself doesn't think his coined stock market valuation indicator is an all-encompassing tell on whether it's a good time to invest. When asked at Berkshire Hathaway's 2017 shareholder meeting about his thoughts on valuation metrics like the Buffett Indicator, the investor said: "Every number has some degree of meaning," Buffett said. "It means more sometimes than others. … And both of the things that you mentioned get bandied around a lot. It's not that they're unimportant. … They can be very important. Sometimes they can be almost totally unimportant. It's just not quite as simple as having one or two formulas and then saying the market is undervalued or overvalued." Still, as Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on more than $300 billion in cash, investors and market observers have speculated that Buffett is concerned about current stock market valuations.

Title: Amazon should buy Bitcoin, shareholders say

Shareholders of Amazon (AMZN-0.48%) have submitted a proposal to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet. The shareholders of the e-commerce giant are urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy (MSTR+3.28%), which heavily invested in Bitcoin, resulting in an increase in its share price. “MicroStrategy – which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet – has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year,” according to a shareholder proposal shared by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). “At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin,” the proposal added. The proposal comes at a time when shareholders of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT-0.64%) are set to vote on Tuesday on whether to invest in Bitcoin. As of this writing, Bitcoin is currently around $99,000 after surpassing the historic $100,000 milestone. The think tank highlighted several institutional and corporate examples to illustrate why Amazon should consider investing in Bitcoin. It pointed to public companies like Tesla (TSLA+2.79%) and Block (SQ-1.44%), which have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Furthermore, the think tank noted that Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders, BlackRock (BLK+1.15%) and Fidelity, have launched Bitcoin ETFs, signaling growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. Additionally, it suggested that even the U.S. government might establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve as early as 2025, underscoring the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The think tank emphasized the importance of diversifying Amazon’s holdings, even considering Bitcoin’s volatility. According to the proposal, as of September 30, 2024, Amazon’s total assets amounted to $585 billion, with $88 billion held in cash, cash equivalents, and bonds. “Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true nation rate, Amazon isn’t adequately protecting billions of dollars of shareholder value simply by holding these assets,” said NCPPR. The think tank argued that Bitcoin outperforms bonds as an investment. As of December 6, 2024, Bitcoin’s price had risen by 131% over the past year, surpassing corporate bonds, which saw an average increase of just 5%, per the proposal. This performance highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a more lucrative alternative to traditional bond investments. Whether or not Amazon decided to add Bitcoin, that’s in the future. However, the way its shareholders have argued in favor of Bitcoin represents how the perception of Bitcoin has changed over the years and how it is getting accepted and becoming more mainstream with each passing day.

Title: Amazon shareholders call for the company to hold 5% of its assets in Bitcoin
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/amazon-shareholders-call-for-the-company-to-hold-5-of-its-assets-in-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-12-09T16:36:35Z
Full Content:
A group of Amazon shareholders has requested that the company allocate 5% of its assets in Bitcoin. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a free-market, independent conservative think tank, submitted the proposal to Amazon for consideration at its 2025 annual shareholder meeting. The proposal, shared by Tim Kotzman, a podcast host covering Bitcoin and MicroStrategy, recommends adding “assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term.” The proposal points to Bitcoin’s price, which has increased more than 131% over the past year, outperforming corporate bonds by more than 126%, on average. “MicroStrategy – which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet – has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year,” the proposal said. “And they’re not alone. Institutional and corporate Bitcoin adoption is becoming more commonplace: more public companies such as Tesla and Block have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets; Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders – BlackRock and Fidelity, respectively – offer their clients a Bitcoin ETF; and the US government may form a Bitcoin strategic reserve in 2025.” The proposal points out that while Bitcoin is a “volatile asset,” Amazon’s stock was the same in the past. Because of this, companies have “a responsibility to maximize shareholder value over the long-term as well as the short-term,” adding: “Diversifying the balance sheet by including some Bitcoin solves this problem without taking on too much volatility. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.” The shareholder proposal comes as Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, said to Microsoft that Bitcoin is the best asset a company should own, claiming it represents the “greatest digital transformation of the 21st century.” In a three-minute video posted on X last week, Saylor said: “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is the next wave. Bitcoin represents the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century; it represents digital capital.” Talking about long-term capital, Saylor noted that risk – including general taxes, politics, recession, regulation, war, and the weather – is destroying over $10 trillion in capital each year. Because of this, investors are turning their attention to digital capital, such as Bitcoin, to avoid these risks. In Saylor’s view, “it makes sense” for Microsoft to buy and hold Bitcoin rather than buy back stock or hold bonds. “If you’re going to outperform, you’re going to need Bitcoin,” Saylor said. “You’ve surrendered hundreds of billions of dollars of capital over the past five years, and you’ve just amplified the risks that your own shareholders face. If you want to escape that vicious cycle, you’re going to need an asset without counterparty risk.” In Saylor’s opinion, that lies with Bitcoin.

Title: BlackRock’s $12B Purchase Of HPS Wrecks The ‘Easy Money’ Fed Narrative

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 26: Scott Kapnick speaks onstage during the Room to Read 2023 New York ... [+] Gala at Gotham Hall on April 26, 2023 in New York City. (Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Room to Read) There’s no such thing as “easy money” or “costless credit” contra what readers are told with great regularity by economists and their enablers in the commentariat. Evidence supporting this statement of the obvious can most easily be found in the powerful force that is compound interest or returns. Precisely due to the power of both, it’s far too costly for those with title to money to part with it cheaply. Despite these truths, commentators including Ruchir Sharma and Christopher Leonard have endlessly promoted the fiction of easy credit, and economists including the self-regarding Thomas Hoenig have routinely aided them in their promotion of fiction. Thankfully reality always intrudes. The most recent intrusion has reached us care of HPS Investment Partners. Founded in 2007 by former Goldman Sachs partner Scott Kapnick, HPS is in the business of private credit whereby it lends directly to businesses. Crucial about what HPS does for the purposes of this write-up is that per a Wall Street Journal article describing HPS’s $12 billion acquisition by BlackRock, “Its once-obscure business of lending directly to businesses has boomed in recent years while banks have pulled back from making risky loans.” Which requires a pause. Stop and think about when HPS opened its doors (2007), and in thinking about it, contemplate the years in which it grew from something small into a thriving business that rated a $12 billion purchase price. 2007 marked a brief beginning of the end of the Fed’s allegedly “easy money” policies, policies that resumed with great speed in 2008 and beyond. In short, HPS’s business of lending directly at higher rates of interest to businesses less able to attain loans from risk-averse banks soared at precisely the time when the Fed was at or near zero. It all raises an obvious question: what purpose would HPS have served if and when credit was costless, as endlessly asserted by Sharma, Leonard et al? It’s a good question, and it can be answered with the simple truth that the surest sign of tight bank credit is low or “zero” rates of interest care of a Federal Reserve that is invariably following actual banks with its vain rate machinations. When banks are charging exceedingly low rates of interest on loans, that’s the surest sign that they’re only lending to the safest of safe borrowers. Translated, low rates of interest signal tight credit whereby risk averse banks lend to sure things. All of which speaks to the genius of Kapnick and his partners for operating in the real world, and in operating in the real world, seeing well beyond the simplistic economic analysis that takes what the Fed does literally. Please. If the Fed could decree credit “costless” or “cheap” as the conventional in thought tell us over and over again, there would be no credit. Something about price controls leading to scarcity. Instead, we see through HPS’s grand success that actual markets prosperously work around the central planners at the Fed. While a central bank desperately searching for relevance made headlines with toothless rate interventions, companies like HPS were providing actual credit to actual businesses at market rates of interest that reflected actual credit costs that no central bank or government associated with a central bank could ever erase. Which is a positive signal, but also an obvious one. It’s positive in the sense that HPS’s multi-billion dollar acquisition reminds us yet again that credit prices aren’t planned by central planners, and it’s obvious simply because if the Fed could do what economists and commentators think it can, the U.S. economy would be too wrecked to write about in the first place.

New data from blockchain analytics firm Akham reveals that asset management titan BlackRock has gone on an aggressive Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation spree. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Arkham says that BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under management – bought billions of dollars worth of BTC in less than a week. “BlackRock bought $2.6 billion of Bitcoin this week. That’s more than half a billion every day.” Bitcoin is trading for $99,137 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours. Arkham also reveals that the asset management giant has been gobbling up the top smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) at a rapid rate as well. According to Arkham’s data, BlackRock has scooped up $500 million worth of Ethereum last week, raising its balance of Ether by 50% during the last 30 days. Ethereum is trading for $3,935 at time of writing, a 1.33% decline in last 24 hours. Arkham also unveils the BTC holdings of SpaceX and Tesla, two tech companies owned by billionaire Elon Musk. According to the blockchain analytics firm, the Bitcoin stacks held by SpaceX and Tesla are up nearly 3x from their average cost basis. “Elon Musk’s companies’ Bitcoin now worth $2 billion. Tesla: 11,509 BTC ($1.17 billion); SpaceX: 8,285 BTC ($842 million). This Bitcoin was acquired at an average cost basis of $34,980 per BTC, meaning they are up $1.3 billion (186%) on these purchases.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Why RPC, Inc. (RES) Is Among the Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES) stands against the other best debt free stocks that pay dividends. Debt financing is not inherently negative; its impact largely depends on how effectively it is utilized. When managed properly, it can drive substantial cash flow and enhance returns for shareholders. However, poor management of debt can weaken a company’s financial stability. In the second quarter, corporate debt levels decreased despite benchmark interest rates remaining unchanged between April and June. Total debt for both investment-grade and non-investment-grade companies fell to $8.432 trillion, down from $8.517 trillion in the previous quarter. Investment-grade companies reduced their debt by approximately 0.9% to $6.610 trillion, while those rated below BBB- by S&P Global Ratings lowered their debt by about 1.2% to $1.822 trillion, based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. READ ALSO: 10 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 3 Years The S&P Global report also highlighted that while total debt among U.S. investment-grade companies declined overall, seven out of 10 nonfinancial sectors experienced debt growth in the second quarter. The energy sector recorded the largest increase, with total debt rising by 4.1% to $502.03 billion. However, this increase was largely offset by a significant 12.7% drop, equivalent to $98.87 billion, in debt within the information technology sector. For non-investment-grade companies, debt decreased across eight of the 10 sectors, with consumer staples experiencing the steepest decline at 7.7%. Conversely, total debt rose only in the healthcare and energy sectors within this category. While many US companies maintain strong balance sheets, a significant share of defaults has come from low-rated firms with negative cash flow, high debt levels, and limited liquidity. These heavily indebted businesses, often referred to as “zombies,” struggle to stay afloat, barely covering their loan interest payments, and are vulnerable to even minor setbacks. An analysis by the Associated Press found that nearly 7,000 publicly traded companies globally, including 2,000 in the U.S., fall into this category. These firms were impacted by years of accumulating inexpensive debt, followed by persistent inflation that pushed borrowing costs to their highest levels in a decade. Additionally, much of the borrowed funds were not directed toward growth initiatives like expansion, hiring, or technological investment but were instead used for stock buybacks. Financial analysts have pointed out that U.S. companies have not taken sufficient steps to reduce their long-term debt, leading to a worsening situation. For the first time, annual interest expenses have exceeded $1 trillion, reaching $1.16 trillion in 2024. According to a Treasury official, the average interest rate on government debt increased to 3.32% in 2024, compared to 2.97% the previous year. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt, currently near 100% of GDP, will climb to 122% by 2034. Using debt to support dividends is typically viewed unfavorably, especially in light of practices observed during the 2020 pandemic. At that time, many private companies turned to dividend recapitalization, borrowing funds to maintain dividend payouts. The trend persisted in 2024 as well. As of September 30, 2024, US companies, including those not supported by private equity, have secured a record $70.2 billion in leveraged loans for dividend recapitalizations, based on data from PitchBook. This amount surpasses the $67.2 billion recorded in 2021, the previous high point for such activity. That said, many companies have maintained stable balance sheets, with US firms consistently setting new records for dividend payments year after year. A pressure pumping machine at the centre of an oilfield, surrounded by a team of workers in the field. To create this list, we first used a screener and identified companies with minimal or no debt. From this pool, we selected those that consistently pay dividends to shareholders and compared their enterprise value (EV) to their market capitalization to gauge which ones are debt-free. We then narrowed down the list by including stocks that had sustainable dividend yields. From that list, we picked 8 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14 Market Cap as of December 7: $1.26 billion Enterprise Value as of December 7: $1.01 billion RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES) is a Georgia-based oil and gas services company. During the third quarter, the company experienced a decline in revenues and profits due to a challenging oilfield services market. Both oil prices and rig counts decreased sequentially, creating additional difficulties in an already competitive landscape. Non-pressure pumping service lines proved more stable, with a modest 4% aggregate revenue decline, while pressure pumping revenues dropped by a low double-digit percentage. The stock is also down by over 18% since the start of the year. However, broader service lines and larger, more diversified customers remained relatively stable. RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES)'s Tier 4 dual fuel assets continued to see high utilization with strong visibility, whereas demand for older equipment was weaker. Management plans to implement targeted cost-saving measures to protect margins until industry conditions improve. In addition to this, RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES) remained debt free at the end of the quarter and returned $8.6 million to shareholders through dividends. The company ended the quarter with $277 million available in cash. In the first nine months of the year, it generated $255.2 million in operating cash flow and its free cash flow for the period came in at $75.8 million. On October 24, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The stock's dividend yield on December 7 came in at 2.74%. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES) grew to 14 in Q3 2024, from 11 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $60.4 million. With nearly 3 million shares, GAMCO Investors owned the largest stake in the company. Overall, RES ranks 6th on our list of the best debt free stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for RES to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RES but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attract $9.9 Billion in Inflows After Trump’s Election Victory
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/spot-bitcoin-etfs-attract-9-9-billion-in-inflows-after-trumps-election-victory/
Time Published: 2024-12-09T14:35:00Z

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen nearly $10 billion inflows since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the US elections, as investors flocked into the cryptocurrency sector since the results were revealed. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs from various major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, attracted $9.9 billion in net inflows following Election Day on November 5, according to Bloomberg, lifting their assets to around $113 billion. According to data from SoSoValue, spot Bitcoin ETFs currently have $112.7 billion in total net assets, equivalent to around 5.62% of the flagship cryptocurrency’s total market capitalization. These inflows came amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally, which saw the price of Bitcoin briefly top the $100,000 mark before correcting to now trade at $98,000. Over the last 30 days, the price of the flagship cryptocurrency is nevertheless up by more than 28.5%. The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency space, over the same period, rose by around $1 trillion. Trump notably picked David Sacks, a former PayPal chief operating officer, as the White House’s new AI and Cryptocurrency czar. Sacks, according to Trump, is set to “guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness.” Bitcoin’s price rise saw various investors step up their accumulation efforts with Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, earlier this month adding an additional 15,400 coins for $1.5 billion, at an average price of $95.976 per coin. The move saw MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings top the 400,000 mark for the first time, with the company achieving a BTC Yield of 38.7% so far this year, and 63.3% year-to-date. It now holds 402,100 BTC that were acquired for $23.4 billion. The move comes at a time in which Bitcoin whales have been taking advantage of the flagship cryptocurrency’s recent price dip to keep on accumulating BTC after short-term holders moved nearly $4 billion in the cryptocurrency to exchanges. According to CryptoQuant analyst Cauê Oliveira, Bitcoin whales took advantage of the “panic selling” to accumulate, with 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entered whale reserves in a single day after short-term holders’ sales. In a post, the analyst noted that the figure was “reflected in institutional addresses on the network” but suggested more BTC was accumulated, as the funds that weren’t withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges and remain in users’ accounts aren’t counted. Per his words, the whale accumulation hasn’t been sufficient to demonstrate a “more widespread buy-the-dip” pattern,” which he said remains concentrated among institutional investors.

Title: Nvidia stock slides as China opens antitrust probe against AI chip heavyweight

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped 2.5% on Monday after China opened an antitrust investigation into the chip giant amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington over artificial intelligence dominance. The probe is aimed at Nvidia's practices regarding possible anti-monopoly violations. It is also set to examine its 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, a purchase that was approved by China's State Administration for Market Regulation under the condition that the chipmaker avoid discriminating against Chinese companies. According to a Chinese media report, the government believes Nvidia’s $7 billion purchase of the Israeli computer networking equipment maker may have violated Beijing's anti-monopoly rules. In a statement released on Monday morning, an Nvidia spokesperson wrote, "We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." The probe comes about a week after the Biden administration implemented another round of semiconductor export restrictions aimed at limiting China's access to advanced chips. The latest US measures include curbing high-bandwidth memory chips shipped to China, crucial components for AI training. “As China continues to struggle to keep up with the most leading-edge AI chips, they probably want to do what they can to slow US firms down," Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance on Monday morning (video above). The Chinese probe against the most important US chipmaker also comes ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House next month. Trump has threatened increased tariffs as part of his policy. "This isn’t just a regulatory issue; it’s a calculated geopolitical manoeuvre," Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, wrote on Monday. "China is sending a strong message that it won’t hesitate to push back, and Nvidia’s targeting is a harbinger of more aggressive measures to come." Nvidia shares have not participated in the overall Trump post-election rally over the past month. The stock is up slightly more than 1% since Trump's win. Nvidia stock is up almost 190% so far this year. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X at @ines_ferre.

US stocks struggled for a foothold on Monday as Nvidia (NVDA) shares slipped amid a Chinese antitrust probe while investors looked ahead at this week's expected inflation data that will set the stage for the Federal Reserve's final interest-rate decision of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose slightly, coming off a losing week for the blue-chip index. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.2%, in the wake of fresh records for both. The next test for Wall Street stocks comes in a consumer inflation report, seen as influential to the Federal Reserve's looming policy decision. The November Consumer Price Index on Wednesday will stress-test widespread expectation for a quarter-point rate cut on Dec. 18, after the latest monthly jobs report failed to shake that conviction. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares slipped after China opened a probe into the chipmaker for potential breaches of its anti-monopoly laws. The company's lead in AI chips has put it in the middle of the US-China wrangles over tech. But US-listed Chinese stocks popped after Beijing made its first move toward loosening monetary policy in over a decade, signaling more and bolder stimulus is on the way. Shares in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) and XPeng (XPEV, 9868.HK) were among the premarket gainers, after stocks in Hong Kong jumped. Markets appear to be taking the abrupt fall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria in stride, with haven asset gold (GC=F) rising modestly. Optimism for China's economy is seen as eclipsing any worries around geopolitical stresses in Syria, South Korea, France, and elsewhere. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy US stocks were mixed on Monday as shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) slid amid a Chinese antitrust probe, and investors awaited this week's inflation data for clues on what the Federal Reserve could decide at its final rate setting meeting of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) opened slightly higher while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) wavered around the flatline. Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.2% with Nvidia shares declining more than 2% after a Chinese media report said Beijing was looking into the AI chip maker as the chip war between China and the US escala Investors await this week's consumer inflation report, seen as a critical data point for the Federal Reserve when policy makers meeting on December 18.

Total debt for both investment-grade and non-investment-grade companies fell to $8.432 trillion, down from $8.517 trillion in the previous quarter. Investment-grade companies reduced their debt by approximately 0.9% to $6.610 trillion, while those rated below BBB- by S&P Global Ratings lowered their debt by about 1.2% to $1.822 trillion, based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. READ ALSO: 10 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 3 Years The S&P Global report also highlighted that while total debt among U.S. investment-grade companies declined overall, seven out of 10 nonfinancial sectors experienced debt growth in the second quarter. The energy sector recorded the largest increase, with total debt rising by 4.1% to $502.03 billion. However, this increase was largely offset by a significant 12.7% drop, equivalent to $98.87 billion, in debt within the information technology sector. For non-investment-grade companies, debt decreased across eight of the 10 sectors, with consumer staples experiencing the steepest decline at 7.7%. Conversely, total debt rose only in the healthcare and energy sectors within this category. While many US companies maintain strong balance sheets, a significant share of defaults has come from low-rated firms with negative cash flow, high debt levels, and limited liquidity. These heavily indebted businesses, often referred to as “zombies,” struggle to stay afloat, barely covering their loan interest payments, and are vulnerable to even minor setbacks. An analysis by the Associated Press found that nearly 7,000 publicly traded companies globally, including 2,000 in the U.S., fall into this category. These firms were impacted by years of accumulating inexpensive debt, followed by persistent inflation that pushed borrowing costs to their highest levels in a decade. Additionally, much of the borrowed funds were not directed toward growth initiatives like expansion, hiring, or technological investment but were instead used for stock buybacks. Financial analysts have pointed out that U.S. companies have not taken sufficient steps to reduce their long-term debt, leading to a worsening situation. For the first time, annual interest expenses have exceeded $1 trillion, reaching $1.16 trillion in 2024. According to a Treasury official, the average interest rate on government debt increased to 3.32% in 2024, compared to 2.97% the previous year. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt, currently near 100% of GDP, will climb to 122% by 2034. Using debt to support dividends is typically viewed unfavorably, especially in light of practices observed during the 2020 pandemic. At that time, many private companies turned to dividend recapitalization, borrowing funds to maintain dividend payouts. The trend persisted in 2024 as well. As of September 30, 2024, US companies, including those not supported by private equity, have secured a record $70.2 billion in leveraged loans for dividend recapitalizations, based on data from PitchBook. This amount surpasses the $67.2 billion recorded in 2021, the previous high point for such activity. That said, many companies have maintained stable balance sheets, with US firms consistently setting new records for dividend payments year after year. A pipeline of natural gas cutting through a rural landscape. To create this list, we first used a screener and identified companies with minimal or no debt. From this pool, we selected those that consistently pay dividends to shareholders and compared their enterprise value (EV) to their market capitalization to gauge which ones are debt-free. We then narrowed down the list by including stocks that had sustainable dividend yields. From that list, we picked 8 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 7 Market Cap as of December 7: $127.43 million Enterprise Value as of December 7: $119.6 million Epsilon Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ:EPSN) is an American independent oil and natural gas company that specializes in the acquisition, development, gathering, and production of natural gas and oil reserves. In its recent earnings call, the company reported its fourth consecutive quarter of growth in liquids volume, revenue, and cash flow from its Permian assets, helping to offset the impact of the current natural gas pricing environment. In Pennsylvania, production and cash flow are expected to increase in the fourth quarter and into next year, supported by improving natural gas market conditions. With a diversified and expanding asset portfolio, the company is well-positioned for volume and cash flow growth in 2025. Epsilon Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ:EPSN) reported revenue of $7.29 million in the third quarter of 2024, up from $6.31 million in the same period last year. The revenue also beat analysts' estimates by nearly $403,000. It reported capital expenditures of $3.9 million for the quarter ending September 30, 2024. These expenses were mainly attributed to completing one gross (0.25 net) well in Ector County, Texas, and drilling two gross (1 net) wells in Alberta, Canada. In addition to this, Epsilon Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ:EPSN) demonstrated strong cash generation. In the first nine months of the year, the company generated over $11.8 million in operating cash flow. At the end of the quarter, it had over $8.3 million available in cash and cash equivalents. Moreover, the company returned $2 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.29%, as of December 7. EPSN is one of the best debt free stocks that pay dividends. At the end of Q3 2024, 7 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Epsilon Energy Ltd. (NASDAQ:EPSN), the same as in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $33.4 million. Among these hedge funds, Solas Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall, EPSN ranks 8th on our list of the best debt free stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for EPSN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) just got a reality check from Bank of America. The firm downgraded the chipmaker from Buy to Neutral, slashed the price target from $180 to $155, and trimmed its 2025 earnings forecast by up to 8%. Why? Two words: fierce competition. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the AI accelerator market with an 80%+ share, while AMD scrambles to hold onto a meager 4%. Even Amazon, one of AMDs biggest cloud customers, is cozying up to NVIDIA and custom chipmakers like Marvell. Add a potential slowdown in PC demand next year, and AMDs near-term outlook looks dicey. But its not all doom and gloom. AMD has been making some serious power moves, like acquiring Silo AI and ZT Systems to solidify its AI strategy. In Q3, its Data Center segment revenue soared 122%, fueled by deals with heavyweights like Microsoft and Meta. AMDs low debt and $4.5 billion in cash give it a safety net, while its long-term plans to generate over $5 billion in GPU revenue in 2024 keep investors intrigued. And lets not forget: AMDs still the go-to for killer CPUs and GPUs, even if gaming and embedded segments had a rough quarter. The majority of Wall Street analysts are still screaming Strong Buy, with an average price target of $190thats a juicy 37% upside from here. But year-to-date, AMD is only up 3.3%, underperforming the tech-heavy NASDAQs (^IXIC) 34.5% rally. The takeaway? AMDs long-term AI potential is massive, but near-term risks are real. This is a stock for investors who like their opportunities bigand their risks bigger. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Subscribe to receive notifications of new posts: 2024-12-09 Since the late 1990s, millions have relied on the Internet for searching, communicating, shopping, and working, though 2.6 billion people (about 31% of the global population) still lack Internet access. Over the years, use of the Internet has evolved from email and static sites to social media, streaming, e-commerce, cloud tools, and more recently AI chatbots, reflecting its constant adaptation to users' needs. This post explores how people interacted online in 2024, based on Cloudflareâs observations and a review of the yearâs DNS trends. Building on similar reports weâve done over the past several years, we have compiled a ranking of the top Internet properties of 2024, with the same categories included in 2023, including Generative AI. In addition to our overall ranking, we chose 9 categories to focus on: Generative AI Social Media Ecommerce Video Streaming News Messaging Metaverse & Gaming Financial Services Cryptocurrency Services As we have done since 2022, our analysis uses anonymized DNS query data from our 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver, used by millions globally. We aggregate domains for each service (e.g., twitter.com, t.co, and x.com for X) and identify the sites that provide services to humans, thus excluding technical domains like root-servers.net. Rankings reflect relative popularity within categories, not absolute traffic. Therefore, a drop in rank doesnât always indicate less traffic to a specific Internet service â it may simply reflect increased competition from other services, leading to a change in rank. This part of the 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review highlights shifts in Internet services, with rising platforms like Temu, GitHub Copilot, and WeChat reflecting changing user preferences. ChatGPT (OpenAI) also played a more prominent role in the generative AI space and in our Overall ranking, nearly reaching the Top 50. Major events like the Paris Olympics and US elections influenced rankings as well, boosting Olympics-related sites and news platforms like CNN and Fox News. Keep reading for a detailed look at the evolution of trends throughout the year. For more, visit our 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review microsite. Along with the lists of most popular Internet services, the Year in Review microsite and its associated blog post explore a number of additional metrics. Since 2021, weâve started our review of rankings with an Overall Top 10 list, showcasing the most popular Internet services globally based on DNS traffic from our 1.1.1.1 resolver. Unsurprisingly, Google (including services like Google Maps and Google Calendar) remained the #1 Internet service in 2024. Since introducing our ranking method two years ago, no other service has come close to challenging Googleâs top spot. Itâs important to note that Apple and Microsoft are similar to Google in that their main domains (apple.com or microsoft.com) are used for many different services. We include other services separately, such as Outlook or iCloud, which use their own specific domains. Google Facebook Apple TikTok Amazon Web Services Microsoft Instagram YouTube Amazon WhatsApp Beyond Google, Facebook consistently held the #2 spot throughout 2024. Last year, it competed with Apple for that position. Apple, which uses domains like apple.com for services related to its software and devices, was generally #3. However, TikTok challenged that position on several days since late August. Amazon Web Services (AWS), differentiated from Amazon by domains like amazonaws.com, performed better this year compared to 2023. It held the #5 spot but often traded places with Microsoft during the year. Instagram also rose in the rankings. It was around #8 in 2023 and steadily improved. Now, it holds the #7 spot, ahead of YouTube. Amazon remained at #9 for most of the year, the same as in 2023. WhatsApp, owned by Meta, appeared in the Top 10 for the first time, taking the #10 spot. Close to the Top 10 were Appleâs iCloud, Netflix (which performs better on weekends), and Microsoftâs Outlook. In the chart below, you can follow the evolution of the top Internet services in our Overall ranking throughout the year. In 2022, X (then known as Twitter) ranked as high as #10 in our overall ranking and was close to Instagram. It never reached the top 10 in 2023, and in 2024, X dropped further, to #14 or #15. More on Xâs performance in the Social Media category below. Generative AI gained global attention in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, and became a global phenomenon during 2023. By 2024, ChatGPT (OpenAI) continues to be by far the most popular service in this category, which includes chatbots, coding bots, and more. Other generative AI services had more stable rankings compared to 2023. ChatGPT (OpenAI) Character.AI Codeium QuillBot Claude (Anthropic) Perplexity GitHub Copilot Wordtune Poe Tabnine Significant changes occurred below ChatGPTâs first place ranking throughout the year. Character.AI, an AI-driven chatbot platform, maintained a strong #2 position, staying ahead of Codeium, a code-generation AI tool that has improved its position since June, and Quillbot, an AI writing and paraphrasing tool. Claude, the AI chatbot from Anthropic, rose in the rankings, particularly after March 4, when the new model, Claude 3, was introduced, and again later in May when it became available in Europe. It reached #5 in June. Perplexity, an AI-driven search and Q&A platform, started the year outside the Top 10 but ended close to Claude. It surpassed Claude for the first time on November 6, 2024, the day after the U.S. elections, reaching #6. This next chart shows movement among the Generative AI services that were more popular later in the year. Several new players entered the Top 10 AI rankings in 2024, showing strong growth. GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, experienced the fastest rise, entering the Top 10 in September (after reaching the Top 20 in June) and staying mostly between #5 and #3 by November, as the next chart shows. Similarly, Suno AI, an AI-powered audio and music generation platform, entered the Top 10 in April, briefly dropped out, but stabilized between #6 and #10 after October â in November, it ranked #6 on weekends. Some platforms lost ground in the rankings. Wordtune, an AI writing assistant, peaked at #4 during mid-year but declined afterward. Tabnine, another AI-powered coding assistant, held the #5 spot for months but slipped after July. In contrast, Sider AI, a coding assistant, entered the Top 20 in March and finished the year around #12. Poe, an AI chatbot platform, ranked #5 in 2023 and between #5 and #6 before June, but ended 2024 moving around #10, performing better during weekends. Google Gemini, Googleâs AI assistant and model, performed better on weekdays and started the year ranking between #7 and #10, but dropped out of the Top 10 after July as newer AI platforms gained momentum. Hugging Face, an open-source AI and machine learning platform, mostly fluctuated between #7 and #9 during the year, peaking at #4 on August 18 around the time several models were updated, and and as it reached its milestone of 5 million users. However, it fell out of the Top 10 by September. Midjourney, an AI-powered platform for generating images, performed well until June, when it was close to the Top 10. Additionally, the OpenAI API ranked #18 in the Generative AI category on May 14-15, coinciding with OpenAIâs announcement of GPT-4o availability, including in the API. Notable trends that we observed when looking at trends for Generative AI services within our larger Overall ranking include: ChatGPT continued its growth in 2024, similar to 2023. In early 2023, it ranked around #200 and ended the year near the top 100. In 2024, it started close to the top 100, reached the top 60 in May with the release of the 4o model, and has been near the top 50 since September, aligning with the return of workers and students to their routines. It ranks higher on weekdays, averaging #56, and drops on weekends. Comparing ChatGPT with other known and non-AI related websites, by late November, ChatGPT ranked ahead of Weather.com, Temu, eBay, Telegram, Google Calendar, and Prime Video, but trailed Disney Plus Character.ai also showed a clear growth trend in our Overall ranking, from outside the top 200 earlier in the year, to above #180 after July, performing better in August, reaching as high as #161. The AI-driven chatbot platform performed better on weekends than on weekdays, the opposite of ChatGPT. Codeium entered the top 300 in July. It ranked higher on weekdays than weekends. According to Kepios, there are an estimated 5.22 billion social media users worldwide in 2024 (up from 4.95 billion last year), representing 63.8% of the global population. Social media continues to play a major role in daily life, serving as a key platform for communication, information, and attention. Once again, social media giants like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram dominate, ranking among the top 10 most popular Internet services overall. Facebook TikTok Instagram X Snapchat LinkedIn Discord Kwai Pinterest Reddit In the Social Media category rankings, the top seven remain unchanged from last year. However, there are notable developments in this category. In 2022, X briefly challenged Instagram for the #3 spot during a few days. Since 2023, X has held a solid #4 position, with Snapchat closing in and reaching #4 for the first time on several days in September and October. LinkedIn stayed steady at #6, followed by Discord. Kwai, a Chinese video app popular in Brazil (with 60 million reported users) and other countries (a reported ), rose from #10 last year to #8. Further down the list, Pinterest kept its #9 rank, while Reddit, previously #8 in 2023, dropped to #10 this year, but peaked at #7 on November 26, just before Black Friday and Thanksgiving in the US. Hereâs the Social Media Top 10 chart for 2024: Our global ranking also highlights several non-Western platforms in the Top 20. These include Douyin (#11), the Chinese version of TikTok; VK (#12), often referred to as the Russian Facebook; and TikTok rivals popular in Southeast Asia SnackVideo (#13) by Chinese Kuaishou (that also owns Kwai). OnlyFans appeared consistently in the Top 20 starting in September, ranking around #18 and surpassing Tumblr by late November. The #18 spot was briefly held by X alternative Threads (by Instagram) in late September and by Bluesky starting November 18. Mastodon-related servers reached as high as #19 for several days since late August. Hereâs a look at X (on top) and its alternatives in this category: Letâs move beyond the Social Media category to see how these platforms performed in our Overall ranking, where bigger shifts between services are evident. As weâve seen, Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon (via an aggregation of popular servers) didnât break into the Top 10 of the Social Media category. However, in the Overall ranking, Mastodon servers, bundled together, consistently ranked between #208 and #248, performing better on weekends. Bluesky entered the Top 250 in September 2024, and gained additional attention after the US elections. It rose sharply after November 14, peaking at #193 on November 20, and has since stabilized around #220.Â Threads entered the Top 250 in August 2024, peaking at #183 on September 24 before dropping out in October. In 2023, Threads peaked at #227 in early July but fell out of the Top 250 by late August. Itâs worth noting that Threads also uses Instagramâs cdninstagram.com for images and videos, which may influence Threads position in our DNS rankings (that said, Instagram wasnât impacted by Threads appearance in our rankings). Here are some other trends we observed among social media apps, and how they did in our Overall ranking: Instagramâs best day (#6 in the Overall ranking) was August 5, 2024, coinciding with the week the app was banned in Turkey. Xâs best day of the year in our ranking was April 14, when it reached #12. This coincided with Arsenal losing the top position in the English football/soccer Premier League (the most-watched sports league in the world) to Manchester City, which went on to win its fourth title in a row. Last year, we noted how football/soccer in England impacted Xâs ranking. X also reached #13 on August 9 and 10, during the final weekend of the Paris 2024 Olympics. X performed better on weekdays, while LinkedIn ranked higher between Mondays and Wednesdays. Snapchat and Discord performed better on weekends. Reddit consistently stayed in our Top 50 in 2024, showing growth from around #45 to #40 by November, with a peak at #38 on November 26. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays. Quora displayed a downward trend in our ranking, dropping from around #140 to #160. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays.Â Tinder, which performs better on Sundays, started the year around #150 but eventually dropped below #160. Tumblr followed a similar pattern, dropping out of the Top 200, where it was in early 2024, to outside the ranking entirely since September. Tumblr performed better on weekends. OnlyFans showed growth in our Overall ranking, sitting around the Top 220 with a peak at #213 on December 1. It performed better on weekends. The importance of e-commerce continues to grow, as highlighted in our recent Cyber Week 2024 blog post. Amazon leads the category, followed by Taobao, the Chinese marketplace, holding a steady #2 spot as it also did in 2023. New to #3 is AliExpress, the global online retail giant from China. Amazon Taobao AliExpress Shopify Temu Alibaba eBay Shein Mercado Libre Wildberries (RU) Compared to 2023, eBay lost its #3 spot globally and dropped down to #7, despite starting 2024 at #3 for several days. AliExpress claimed #3, followed by Shopify (#4), the Canadian platform hosting numerous online stores, and Temu (#5). Temu, the low-cost, fast-fashion marketplace launched in the US in September 2022, ended 2023 at #7 but rose to #5 in 2024, occasionally reaching #4 since August. Alibaba dropped to #6 in September. Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion brand, continued its growth and overtook Mercado Libre (#8) in November. A surprise this year was Wildberries, often called Russiaâs âAmazon,âÂ that has been expanding to several neighboring countries (including some in Europe). It climbed to #10 in September, surpassing OLX (which held #10 for several months), Rakuten, and Lazada. Looking at how e-commerce sites performed in our Overall ranking, we observed the following trends: Amazon fluctuated between #9 and #10 after October, returning to #9 on November 30 and December 1, during the Black Friday weekend. It often performed better on weekends. Shopifyâs best day of the year was Black Friday, November 29, when it reached #55. The global e-commerce platform performed better during weekdays. Temu, known for low-cost products, started 2024 outside the Top 100 but climbed into the Top 70 by year-end. It performed best in late October and early November, peaking at #63, with a Black Friday spike to #65. Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion brand, showed growth, nearing the Top 100 in early 2024 before dropping to the Top 140 between June and October. It rebounded in November, peaking at #83 on Black Friday. A similar trend was observed in 2023, when it ended the year around the Top 120. Hereâs the comparison between recent players Temu and Shein: eBay consistently ranked between #72 and #80, peaking at #62 on October 5-6 and again in late November, just before Black Friday. It often performed better on weekends. Mercado Libre, the Latin American marketplace, had its best day on Black Friday, November 29, reaching #100. Adidas entered the Top 250, ranking #232 on Black Friday, November 29. Target performed well in November, peaking at #133 on November 27, the day before Thanksgiving in the US, and at #127 on December 1. It often performed better on Sundays. Walmart improved its performance from September onward, with its best days on November 25-26, reaching #150. Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, peaked at #247 on June 29. The relevance of video streaming platforms shows no signs of fading. In 2024, the Top 3 rankings stayed unchanged from 2023, with YouTube firmly holding the #1 spot, followed by Netflix. Among paid streaming services, Netflix leads, trailed by Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video. Other paid streaming services are outside the Top 10, including, in ranked order: HBO/Max, Hulu, Peacock, and Paramount Plus. YouTube Netflix Twitch Roku Disney Plus Amazon Prime Video Vimeo Plex.TV Pluto TV Â Bigo Live Twitch, a live-streaming platform for gaming, kept the #3 spot, as it did in 2023 and 2022. Roku, a digital media player that also offers streaming services, ranked #4, maintaining its position from last year. Similarly, Disney Plus (#5) and Amazon Prime Video (#6) held their spots, while Hulu dropped out of the Top 10. The creative video platform Vimeo showed clear popularity growth since May, followed by recent players like Plex TV, a media platform with streaming that performed better starting in October, and Pluto TV, a free ad-supported streaming service that also showed growth throughout the year. Bigo Live, a live-streaming social platform, entered the Top 10 rankings in May.Â Next, the Top 10 overtime perspective: Throughout the year, Disney Plus occasionally challenged Roku, especially on weekends, a trend similar to what was observed in 2023. Looking at how video streaming services performed in our Overall ranking, we found: Netflix consistently ranked #12 on most weekends, particularly Sundays, through late May and resumed the same trend after August. Netflix, Disney Plus, Prime Video, and HBO/Max were more popular on weekends, especially Sundays. Disney Plus ranged between #50 and #60, with a strong start to the year and a spike to #51 on September 22, coinciding with the premiere of the new Marvel show Agatha All Along. Prime Video had its best day in the rankings on May 25, at #56, the day the movie Bombshell with Nicole Kidman premiered on the platform. HBO/Max was consistently around the Top 100 until August. but dropped out after October. Peacock had an inconsistent presence in the Top 250 but reappeared in late July during the Paris 2024 Olympics, reaching #176 on July 28. That was one of the busiest days for Olympic events, as detailed in our blog post on the event. Paramount Plus was mostly outside the Top 250 this year but peaked at #216 on February 11, the day of the Super Bowl, which the platform streamed. News organizations are vital for keeping the public informed, especially during crises. With that in mind, this ranking of news services, some of which are well-established news outlets while others are news aggregators, also highlights a few newsworthy trends. Globo BBC NY Times CNN Fox News Google News Yahoo Finance Daily Mail RT NewsBreak This yearâs rankings in the news category mirrored 2023 at the top. Globo, the Brazilian media giant â one of the largest in Latin America and globally â encompassing radio, TV, newspapers, and magazines, stayed #1, followed by the British BBC at #2, that operates globally and in 42 languages.Â The New York Times rose to #3 this year (it was #5 in 2023), overtaking CNN (#4) and Fox News (#5), which dropped from its position at #3 in 2023 and this year came behind CNN. Several prominent outlets, such as the Washington Post, The Guardian, NPR, and the Wall Street Journal, fell out of the Top 10 this year. These outlets had higher rankings in late 2023 following the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict on October 7. News aggregators gained prominence, with Google News (#6) and also Yahoo Finance (#7), focused on financial news (and that came in front of Yahoo News), and NewsBreak (#10), a US-based local news app, entering the Top 10.Â The British Daily Mail, which has also expanded its focus to the US and Australia, ranked #8, followed by RT, the Russian news TV network with a global presence. RT launched its Brazil/Portuguese version in late 2023 and was recently highlighted in a report and an alert from the US Department of State regarding its global operations. The US elections impacted rankings. CNN climbed to #2 on November 5, election day, and reached #1 on November 6, while Fox News peaked at #3. NBC News also improved, reaching #11 on November 5 and #7 the following day. Associated Press ranked #8 on November 5 as well. Hereâs the News ranking: Notable news trends we identified in our larger Overall ranking include: As weâve seen in the News category, the US elections on November 5, 2024, caused CNN, Fox News, and others to jump in our rankings. This trend was also evident in the Overall ranking for the following media outlets, listed by performance. November 6 was the best day of 2024 for each: CNN: #105 on November 5; #72 on November 6 Fox News: #153 on November 5; #92 on November 6 BBC: #115 on November 5, and #97 on November 6 NY Times: #149 on November 5; #98 on November 6 NBC News: #160 on November 6 Associated Press: #166 on November 6 Google News: #250 on November 5; #228 on November 6 Wall Street Journal: #241 on November 6 Washington Post: #245 on November 6 In the next chart we show rankings for CNN, Fox News, the BBC, and NY Times: Brazil made headlines in late February when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters protested to defend the former president against investigations. During this period, Globo moved up the rankings, reaching #60 on February 24-25, 2024. WP, the news aggregator from Poland, had its best day on July 26 (#188), coinciding with Polish lawmakers voting to allow security forces to use lethal weapons with âimpunityâ, particularly at the tense border with Belarus. WP peaked again on November 6 (#180), the day after the US elections, when the result of the election was mentioned in Polandâs parliament. Its third and final peak was on Black Friday, November 29, again at #180. Rambler, the Russian news aggregator, peaked at #218 on February 23, 2024, the day after the Moscow concert hall attack and the same day Vladimir Putin addressed the nation. Messaging remains relevant, especially for specific communication purposes. Appleâs iMessage is excluded from this category because it lacks a unique domain name for traffic analysis. With that in mind, WhatsApp retained its position as the top messaging service in 2024, consistent with 2023 and 2022. WhatsApp QQ Telegram Viber WeChat Signal LINE KakaoTalk eitaa.com Facebook Messenger Following WhatsApp at #2 is, for the second year in a row, the Chinese service QQ, also known as Tencent QQ, which includes games and mobile payments and is popular in Asia. Telegram, widely used in Eastern Europe and Asia, took the #3 spot from Viber in June. Viber remains popular in Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. WeChat rose this year, securing #5 in October and surpassing Signal, which held that position for most of the year but dropped to #6 (the same position in which it ended 2023). LINE from Japan ranked #7, while new entries to the Top 10 included South Koreaâs KakaoTalk (#8) and Iranâs eitaa.com (#9), a messaging application, designed for both mobile and desktop platforms, that is popular in Iran and among the Farsi (Persian) language diaspora. Facebook Messenger rounded out the Top 10 at #10. Here are other messaging trends from our Overall ranking: WhatsApp, as noted, performed better this year, growing in popularity since late July, stabilizing at #9 by mid-October, and performing better during weekdays. Telegramâs best days were between July 16-18, during developments in the Ukraine war, including the Russian Black Sea Fleet leaving Crimea. Telegram is widely used by thousands of Russian âwar correspondents,â as recently reported. Eitaa, the Iranian cloud-based messaging app, peaked at #185 in our Overall ranking on April 14, 2024, the day of Iranian strikes against Israel, which we covered in a blog post on Internet trends. WeChat spiked in our Overall ranking (#116) on July 30, 2024, coinciding with Chinese leaders pledging to tilt stimulus efforts towards consumers. Gaming and metaverse both involve immersing players in other worlds. Leaving concepts aside, weâve grouped gaming and the metaverse into the same category since 2022. Roblox dominated this category again in 2024, retaining its top spot, followed by Microsoftâs Xbox at #2. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, ranked third. Roblox Xbox/Xbox Live Epic Games/Fortnite Steam PlayStation Electronic Arts Blizzard Riot Games/League of Legends Minecraft Garena Xbox/Xbox Live held #2 consistently, but Epic Games/Fortnite contested the position earlier in the year and again in November. Steam was a surprise this year, jumping to #4, ahead of PlayStation. It even rose to #2 in late March and early April, coinciding with the launch of a new demo. Other platforms on the rise included Electronic Arts, Blizzard, and Riot Games/League of Legends. Minecraft made the Top 10 at #9, performing best on July 5, 6, and 10, when it reached #7. Garena, the Singaporean game developer and publisher, entered the Top 10 for the first time. Oculus, Metaâs VR headset and metaverse service, dropped out of the Top 10 to #11, after ending 2023 at #5. It performed better earlier in the year (until April) and in late November. Hereâs the top chart across 2024: Here are other metaverse and gaming trends from our Overall ranking: Robloxâs best day in 2024 was January 21, when it reached #20. The platform performed better on weekends, especially Sundays, similar to other popular gaming platforms like Xbox/Xbox Live, Epic Games/Fortnite, Steam, and PlayStation. Epic Games/Fortniteâs best day was January 1, 2024. Xbox/Xbox Live (#37) and PlayStation (#43) had their best day on November 2, 2024, the day before the launch of the new version of the classic game Aero the Acro-Bat: Rascal Rival Revenge. Steamâs best day was August 24, 2024, during the week of Gamescom 2024 in Germany. Several new games were released that week, including Tactical Breach Wizards and Dustborn. Minecraft, celebrating its 15th anniversary in May 2024, had its best days on June 15 (#90), following the release of the Tricky Trials game update by Mojang Studios, and August 17 (#90), coinciding with the release of Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshot 24w33a. Financial services cover everything from traditional banking to cryptocurrencies and tax tools. Stripe, the Irish-American payment platform, kept its #1 spot for the second year, after overtaking PayPal in this category in 2023. Stripe TradingView Alipay PayPal Nubank (BR) Binance Coinbase Banco do Brasil Bradesco Bank Itau PayPal spent only a few days at #2 and a few others at #3 this year, but ultimately dropped to #4. TradingView, a platform specializing in tools for traders and investors, climbed to #2, followed by AliPay, the Chinese mobile and online payment platform, which secured #3. Nubank, the Brazilian neobank (only online) and considered to be the most valuable, one of the biggest Latin America financial groups and the world's biggest digital bank, entered the Top 10 at #5, while Binance rose to #6 (up from #8 last year). Binance also peaked at #3 on November 12-13, following the US elections, as Bitcoin reached new highs. In the crypto space, Coinbase joined the Top 10 for the first time. Brazilâs growth in online banking, digital banks, and payments in Latin America has driven traditional banks to expand their digital presence. In 2024, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, and ItaÃº performed well and rose into the Top 10, moving more than ever to the online space including in partnership with each other (as detailed in these two (1), (2) articles in Portuguese). And hereâs the crypto perspective in this Financial services category: Next, we highlight other financial services trends from our Overall ranking: Stripeâs best days were just before Black Friday, on November 18-19 and November 25, reaching #81 during those days. Stripe performed better on weekends and maintained consistent rankings throughout the year. PayPal ranked higher around Black Friday week, peaking at #89 on November 21 and on Black Friday, November 29. Brazilian bank Nubank performed best a few days before Carnival in Brazil (February 10-14), reaching #87 on February 1 and 3 and #92 on February 10. It also ranked well on Black Friday, November 29, peaking at #90. In addition to our Financial Services category, we evaluated cryptocurrency-related services specifically. Despite a few crashes over recent years, the crypto sector continued to evolve in 2024, experiencing a late-year boom, as we explore below. Binance and Coinbase retained the top two spots, while OKX climbed to #3 this year. Binance Coinbase OKX 2miners.com CoinMarketCap Coingecko Bybit Exodus Tonkeeper NiceHash CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data platform, dropped to #6, making way for OKX in late August, while new entrant 2miners.com rose to #4. CoinMarketCap ranked #5, followed by several dynamic new entrants in the Top 10: Bybit (#7): A cryptocurrency exchange offering spot and derivatives trading. Exodus (#8): A user-friendly, multi-asset cryptocurrency wallet. Tonkeeper (#9): A secure wallet for managing Toncoin and related assets. NiceHash, a platform connecting cryptocurrency miners and buyers, performed better in 2023, but dropped from #5 to #10 this year. The US elections also had an apparent effect on the Overall ranking: Binance entered the Top 100 for the first time on September 26, when Bitcoin surged past $65,000, driven by positive US employment data and Chinaâs announcement of economic stimulus measures. It peaked at #97 on November 13, following the US elections and Donald Trumpâs victory, as Bitcoin's price surpassed $90,000 for the first time. Coinbaseâs best day was November 21, reaching #131, as Bitcoin approached $100,000 (which it surpassed on December 4, although our ranking only covers up to December 1). OKX peaked at #149 on November 22, and CoinMarketCap reached #176 on November 23. CoinGeckoâs best day was November 11, the week following the US elections, when it climbed to #137. Outside the categories we reviewed as part of the Year in Review, several notable trends emerged in our Overall ranking: The Paris 2024 Summer Olympics (July 26âAugust 11, 2024) appeared in our Top 250 Overall ranking, with Olympics-related sites debuting on July 27 (#195), the first full day of events. The peak was on July 30 (#177), driven by LÃ©on Marchandâs swimming performances and the US womenâs artistic gymnastics medal, as detailed in our Olympics blog post. The final day in the Top 250 was August 11 (#217). Spotify ranked between #17 and #18 this year, performing best in October, spending most of the month at #17. However, as our list ends on December 1, we are not tracking the impact of the recently launched Spotify Wrapped. Tesla entered the Top 250 after October. Its best day was October 12 (#245), following the Cybercab robotaxi reveal. It also ranked higher on November 17 (#246), after a post-US elections stock rally. GitHubâs best day was November 8 (#31), coinciding with its announcement of enhanced security protocols, including mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA) for organizations. NBA appeared in the Top 250 until early March, with its best day on February 4, during these games. Nike ranked only once, on March 26 (#236), during the annual Air Max Day celebration. Brazilâs official Judiciary site peaked at #105 on October 6, during the first round of municipal elections. Ticketmaster peaked at #169 on October 8, during a major service disruption, followed by October 9 (#170), the day Australian F1 tickets went on sale. Intuitâs best day was April 15 (#121), US Tax Day, consistent with previous years. Weather.com peaked at #61 between August 4â6, during Hurricane Debbyâs landfall in Florida. The best day for IMDb (the Internet Movie Database) was January 1 (#220). Example.com, a domain used for documentation purposes, ranked between #24 and #56. The Internet continues to shape how we socialize, work, and stay informed. Our 2024 rankings highlight the enduring dominance of platforms like Google, Facebook, and TikTok, alongside the rapid rise of generative AI services like OpenAIâs ChatGPT, with new players like GitHub Copilot and Claude making strides. In social media, X shows declining influence, while Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon are carving out niches but remain far from overtaking established platforms. Temu continues to rise in e-commerce, while Shein and AliExpress strengthened their global positions. In cryptocurrency, Binance regained momentum as Bitcoin surged, and newer players entered the scene. Gaming saw Roblox maintain its lead, with Steam experiencing notable growth. Events like the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, US elections, and war-related attacks also shaped Internet trends, emphasizing how global events influence online activity. These trends mirror real-world developments and set the stage for an interconnected, tech-driven future. On a final note, creating rankings is a team effort that comes with its own challenges and requires careful attention and frequent updates.

Title: Crypto ETFs Note Record Inflows as BTC and ETH’s Prices Surge
URL: https://www.cryptocynews.com/crypto-etfs-note-record-inflows-as-btc-and-eths-prices-surge/
Time Published: 2024-12-09T13:54:27Z

Cryptocurrrency News The broader digital asset market had a historic week, with rising investor interest in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With positive regulatory developments and increasing market confidence, crypto ETFs recorded new milestones that signified the continuation of a bullish market momentum before the year ends. US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive turnaround over the past week as they noted inflows of $2.73 billion. The week started cautiously, with the market experiencing outflows of $435.5 million and $122.8 million on December 2 and 3, which observers believe were influenced by the national holiday. However, the flow momentum changed during the midweek as the sector saw significant daily inflows of $353.6 million, $676 million, $788.7 million, and $376.6 million on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, respectively. BlackRock’s IBIT accounted for over $2.6 billion of the funds flow. This achievement reflects BlackRock’s dominance in the ETF space. In addition, these robust inflows coincided with Bitcoin’s price rise above $100,000 for the first time. BTC’s ascent to its all-time high signifies a psychological victory for the crypto industry, reinforcing the token’s reputation as a hedge against inflation. Like their Bitcoin counterparts, Ether ETFs also saw a notable increase in inflows. The US spot Ether ETFs saw net inflows of about $2 billion this past week. The favorable regulatory climate in the US and the incoming administration’s pro-crypto position contribute to Ether ETFs’ rising appeal. It has encouraged investors to diversify their investment portfolios beyond BTC and contributed to Ether’s strong performance. Many institutional investors prefer Ethereum because, in contrast to Bitcoin, it provides use cases through its smart contract features. Even though the United States still leads the crypto ETF narrative, other nations are making significant strides. One of those nations is Argentina, which has incorporated cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds into its financial markets with President Javier Milei’s approval. The issuance of ETF CEDEARs (Argentine deposit certificates), which give local investors access to overseas crypto-linked assets, was recently approved by the CNV, the country’s securities regulator. Although ETF CEDEARs have been legal for six years, this is the first time they have been issued, making it a significant development for Argentina. This product offers various investment options, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, gold, and the Chinese stock market index. Argentina hopes to use these tools to increase international investment and boost its financial sector. It is worth noting that the South American nation has previously acknowledged the legitimacy of smart contracts and welcomed cryptocurrency-backed funding for businesses. These crypto funds establish the country as a pioneer in digital asset adoption in the region. The global financial landscape is rapidly changing due to the explosive rise of crypto ETFs, which link traditional and digital finance. With inflows from leading players like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, the total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs in the US have increased to almost $113 billion. This inflow spike results from increased trust in cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Another notable contributor is Donald Trump’s election win and supportive stance on digital assets. The incoming administration’s supportive legislation will lay the groundwork for a wider acceptance of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. Steps like appointing a pro-crypto chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and establishing a unique White House position for digital assets demonstrate a strong commitment to promoting innovation in the industry. Nevertheless, ongoing regulatory clarity, technological advancement, and investor education will be critical to the success of crypto ETFs. For instance, market confidence alone won’t be enough to sustain a push for Bitcoin above $100,000. Other external factors like macroeconomic stability and greater institutional engagement are also necessary. Meanwhile, regions such as Argentina and El Salvador demonstrate how cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds can help cushion economic instability. Countries can open new investment opportunities and attract foreign capital by establishing crypto ETFs like ETF CEDEARs. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Nvidia Stock Slips as Chinese Regulators Announce Anti-Monopoly Probe

Nvidia (NVDA) shares moved lower Monday after China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it is investigating the chipmaking giant for potential violations of the country's anti-monopoly laws. The antitrust regulator said Monday that it is looking into Nvidia over the chipmaker's 2020 acquisition of Israeli-American networking hardware maker Mellanox Technologies. SAMR said it "is opening a probe into Nvidia in accordance with law," according to a translation from CNBC. In a statement provided to Investopedia, a company spokesperson wrote, "NVIDIA wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business." The $6.9 billion deal was announced in March 2019 and completed in April 2020, days after the same Chinese regulators signed off on the deal along with regulators in Europe, Mexico, and the U.S. Approval for the deal came with the conditions from Chinese regulators that Nvidia wouldn't discriminate against its companies and that Mellanox informed competitors of new products within 90 days of providing them to Nvidia, according to Bloomberg. Shares of the chipmaker that have surged thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom were down about 2% Monday afternoon to $139.61, but still have risen more than 180% since the start of the year. UPDATE—This article has been updated with a statement from Nvidia, additional information, and the latest share price movements.

Title: Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are America's best-managed companies right now, report says

Time Published: 2024-12-09T13:24:00Z

Apple (AAPL+0.36%) is the best-managed company in the U.S., according to a new ranking by The Wall Street Journal. Of 250 companies, Nvidia (NVDA-2.69%) came in second, followed by Microsoft (MSFT-0.64%), Intel (INTC-3.08%), and Mastercard (MA+1.21%) to round out this year’s top five. The ranking, developed by the Drucker Institute, measures the effectiveness of corporate management using five areas: customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility, and financial strength. This year, Apple and Nvidia knocked Microsoft out of the top spot — a position it has held for the last four years. Apple ranked highly for innovation and financial strength. Nvidia also ranked first for financial strength and second in employee engagement. The two companies have competed neck and neck to be the world’s most valuable company. Apple currently has a $3.67 trillion market capitalization. Nvidia is worth $3.49 trillion as of market close Friday. Shares of the chipmaker, which has seen a massive boost from artificial intelligence as demand for its AI chips booms, are up almost 200% this year. That’s compared with 30% for Apple. Microsoft has also seen healthy growth this year, adding almost 20% to its share value for a $3.30 trillion market cap. The company also ranked near the top in innovation and financial strength. Intel, on the other hand, has had a rocky year. Ranked as the fourth best-managed company in the country, Intel ousted its CEO Pat Gelsinger last week after he failed to turn around the company’s performance. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. That included reducing its headcount by roughly 15,000, or 15% of its workforce. Gelsinger said at the time that these were the “most consequential changes” in the company’s history. Intel also reportedly hired Morgan Stanley and other advisors to help fend off potential activist investors, according to CNBC (CMCSA+1.14%). Early last month, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 leading U.S. stocks, to make room for Nvidia as the index shifts toward AI pioneers. Nonetheless, Intel ranked first across all 250 companies in social responsibility, and second in customer satisfaction.

Donate Webathon Nick Gillespie | 12.9.2024 8:00 AM There are just two days left in Reason's annual Webathon, the one week a year when we ask our online readers to support our award-winning journalism with fully tax-deductible donations (go here to make yours!). Your support makes everything we do possible—all the articles, videos, podcasts, events, and media appearances in which we act as your voice in public debates about the size, scope, and spending of government. So give a little less to the IRS and a little more to the magazine of "Free Minds and Free Markets"! Scroll down for a great swag list (for what it's worth, my favorites are the "Abolish Everything" T-shirt and the Reason blanket) and donate now. The challenge grant of $30,000 from Daniel Shuchman has now been met and we are happy to announce a new challenge grant of $25,000 from Kerry and Helen Welsh. That means every dollar you donate turns into two until this new challenge grant is reached! This past year has been absolutely crazy, with the weirdest presidential race in U.S. history, including the incumbent dropping out via X (come on, man!), assassination attempts, and one of the most spectacular political comebacks ever. And next year will almost certainly be an even wilder ride, as Donald Trump promises to whittle down the reach of the government even as he pushes tariffs and mass deportation. But maybe the biggest story of 2024—and 2025, too—is something that runs roughshod over and around government: bitcoin, which recently cracked the $100,000 mark and gained a whole new aura of respectability. Reason has been covering this digital gold since its inception and our coverage exemplifies our principled, libertarian approach to journalism. Earlier this year, major investment firms like BlackRock and Fidelity started hawking their own bitcoin ETFs and politicians such as Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming (a Reason Interview subject) gained new traction calling for a strategic bitcoin reserve. Reason has been lauding bitcoin's challenge to "state-controlled money" from the beginning: Through the Soho Forum, we sponsored a debate in 2018 between bitcoin bear Peter Schiff and bitcoin bull Erik Voorhees that has pulled over 1 million views and remains a great introduction to why this alternative asset is going to be around for the long haul (and why it threatens the establishment): Over the years, we've talked with major figures in the bitcoin world like Michael Saylor, whose company MicroStrategy owns the single-biggest known cache of bitcoin, Broken Money author Lyn Alden, and Balaji Srinivasan, the super-investor whose bold prediction of bitcoin going to a million dollars didn't come true (yet). We explored how the dark web site Silk Road demonstrated a controversial use case for bitcoin and have covered and participated in the annual Bitcoin Conference since its inception. When FTX, the shady crypto exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), hit the skids, we talked with Kraken founder Jesse Powell about the need for investor due diligence and how SBF tried to rig regulations in his company's favor. We debunked the phony argument that bitcoin was a disaster for the environment in articles and videos by Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation, and we showcased how bitcoin provides hope and money for people in authoritarian countries. Jim Epstein's Cypherpunks Write Code video series explored the prehistory of cryptocurrency and Brian Doherty went "In Search of the Elusive Bitcoin Billionaire" in 2018. Senegalese app developer Fodé Diop explained how bitcoin-enabled smartphones might help developing nations break free of what he calls "monetary colonialism": Just last week, Zach Weissmueller and Liz Wolfe talked with crypto podcaster and investor Nic Carter about how Trump's embrace of digital assets affected the 2024 election. Last time around, Trump was antagonistic toward bitcoin and crypto; this time he's all in (in fact, I had a memorable encounter with him at Pubkey, a bitcoin-themed bar in Greenwich Village this fall). Better yet, he's named innovation-friendly Paul Atkins to head up his Securities and Exchange Commission, a giant improvement over outgoing chairman Gary Gensler, who did all he could to throttle crypto. Our coverage of bitcoin—like our coverage of everything—isn't uncritical boosterism, of course. Just a few weeks ago, staffer Katarina Hall reported on her unsuccessful attempts to use bitcoin in El Salvador, the first country to adopt it alongside the U.S. dollar as legal tender. And our resident song parodist Remy not only mocked Dogecoin, he had fun at the expense of tech bros with "Bitcoin Billionaire," a rap that has generated over 1.6 million views: All of this is to say: If you find bitcoin and cryptocurrencies interesting—and if you've made some gains from them in this rally—think about supporting Reason. Since 1968, we've been talking about ways to make the world better, freer, and more fair, all without necessarily dragging government or politics into the matter. Bitcoin is the latest, and possibly greatest, development on that front in a very long time.

Title: Tesla, Google, Amazon: How Much They Are Spending For Their CEOs' Safety
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/how-much-microsoft-tesla-amazon-spend-protecting-their-ceos-7207126
Time Published: 2024-12-09T12:58:55Z

The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has cast a spotlight on the extensive security measures employed by Wall Street's elite to ensure their safety. With the increasing risks associated with high-profile roles, companies are shelling out significant amounts to protect their top executives. Big tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Tesla are among the many that prioritise personal security for their CEOs. These measures often include personal security details, private transportation, and state-of-the-art security systems, adding millions to operational costs annually. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella A prime example is Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella. Microsoft ramped up security for its CEO, allocating over $58,000 for his travel security this year. This figure was disclosed in the company's SEC filing on October 24. Mr Nadella, set to earn $79.1 million this year, had previously requested a pay reduction to offset rising security expenses after multiple incidents earlier in the year, CNBC first reported. Tesla CEO Elon Musk In the first two months of 2024, Tesla spent $500,000 on Elon Musk's security, more than five times what was spent in the same period in 2019. This follows a significant increase in security costs, with Tesla disclosing $2.4 million spent on Mr Musk's protection in 2023. Between 2015 and 2018, Mr Musk's monthly security expenses averaged $145,000. His protection is managed by high-profile firms, including Gavin de Becker & Associates and his own Foundation Security. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink World's largest asset manager, BlackRock, doubled its security spending for CEO Larry Fink in 2023, as per security filings. The company spent $216,837 on personal security guards and $563,513 on upgrading Mr Fink's home security system. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Last year, Alphabet spent over $6.7 million on CEO Sundar Pichai for expenses, including security, retirement contributions, company vehicles, and other benefits, as per a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. These expenditures formed the bulk of his total compensation package, exceeding $6.8 million. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy In 2023, Andy Jassy's transportation costs totalled $986,164, covering business travel and security upgrades, as per a Quartz report. His compensation dropped compared to 2022, largely due to a decline in Amazon's stock price and fewer restricted stock units. The stock price fell from $156.51 in 2022 to $143.90 in 2023, as per filings. Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world

Title: China is going after Nvidia

Time Published: 2024-12-09T12:55:00Z

Nvidia (NVDA-2.69%) is under investigation for allegedly violating anti-monopoly laws in China. The country’s State Administration for Market Regulation has launched a probe into whether Nvidia’s acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies violated anti-monopoly laws, according to a report from China Central Television on Monday. Shares of Nvidia fell nearly 2% in pre-market trading on Monday. The leading artificial intelligence chipmaker bought Mellanox for $6.9 billion in 2020 after receiving conditional approval from Chinese authorities. Conditions included requirements that Nvidia and Mellanox not bundle or tie together products, continue to supply on fair terms, and ensure that chips from Chinese manufacturers worked with the technology. Other requirements were aimed at maintaining independence between the two firms, and lessening any potential impacts of export controls amid the trade war between the U.S. and China that began in 2018 under the first Trump administration. This comes as chip trade tensions between the two economic superpowers continue to escalate.

Title: China is probing Nvidia in a major escalation of its chip wars with the US | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: China has opened an antitrust investigation into American chipmaker Nvidia, the world’s largest provider of processors that power artificial intelligence, according to Chinese state media. The probe serves as the latest escalation of a growing battle for AI dominance, which both the United States and China believe is crucial for national security. China Central Television in a report Monday said the Chinese government believes Nvidia’s purchase of Israeli networking company Mellanox could violate the country’s anti-monopoly laws, though the report did not specify what the merger did to potentially break the law. China approved the acquisition in 2020. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell less than 2% in premarket trading Monday. The stock is among the hottest on the market, surging nearly 200% this year as the AI boom has fueled demand for the company’s chips. Its market value is more than $3 trillion, second only to Apple. The tit-for-tat China-US chip war has entered a new phase this month, after the Biden administration imposed another round of restrictions on high tech memory chip sales to China a week ago. The memory chips are different than the graphics processors Nvidia makes, but they are also crucial technology that helps power AI. The administration’s new export controls are the third such round of chip sales restrictions to China. The United States fears that China could use AI to gain a military advantage, and US Commerce Department officials said they believed the restrictions would slow China’s development of AI chips — and industry experts believe the US government’s plan will work. But China’s Commerce Ministry lambasted the United States’ restrictions, saying they pose “a significant threat” to the stability of global supply chains. China’s government retaliated last week by banning the sale of materials essential for manufacturing the chips, including germanium and gallium. A year ago, China had curbed the sale of those materials but created loopholes that allowed for some sales to continue. Those have now been closed. Senior US officials have also accused China of stealing American-made AI software, which Beijing denies. The Nvidia investigation ups the ante. The company is the face of the AI tech revolution and hurting Nvidia could harm the American company’s ambitions to continue to power AI around the world. Nvidia is also under antitrust scrutiny in the United States, according to Bloomberg. In addition to curbing materials and chips sales, both China and the United States are trying to bolster their own development and manufacturing of microprocessors at home. Through the CHIPS Act, the Biden administration has pumped billions of dollars into Intel and other companies to boost domestic production of chips and reduce America’s reliance on China and other foreign countries for the technology. Meanwhile, China in May announced plans to set up its largest-ever semiconductor state investment fund worth $47.5 billion, funded by investments from six of the country’s largest state-owned banks.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- It was little more than two and a half years ago that Franklin Templeton’s boss Jenny Johnson took to LinkedIn to express her excitement about buying European private credit stalwart Alcentra. Today, a key part of the acquired business is struggling to justify the enthusiasm. Most Read from Bloomberg A Chicago Skyscraper Cements the Legacy of a Visionary Postmodern Architect NYC’s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp Kansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit In its heyday, Alcentra was up there with current direct-lending success stories such as Ares Management Corp. and Intermediate Capital Group Plc. as they jousted for preeminence in making loans to Europe’s companies. But unlike old rivals that are expanding their assets at breakneck speed, Alcentra has shrunk. At its peak it managed about $43 billion of assets, according to Fitch Ratings. By the time Franklin struck the deal to acquire the London-based lender, it had $38 billion. It now has about $32 billion. Alcentra’s corporate direct-lending franchise, the engine room of most private credit businesses, has halved from €12 billion ($12.7 billion) in 2020 to €6 billion, according to an analysis by Bloomberg News of the firm’s public filings. With other asset-management giants such as BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. shopping around for their own purchases in the booming $1.6 trillion private credit market, Alcentra is a cautionary tale from the industry. Franklin’s purchase of Alcentra in 2022 is dwarfed by BlackRock’s acquisition of HPS Investment Partners — and the low sale price reflects problems that predate the sale — but its ongoing troubles with its once-flagship fund are a reminder that fortunes can change fast in this industry. Back in 2019 Alcentra raised one of Europe’s then largest direct-lending funds. Botched leadership changes, a staff exodus and some poor investments have weighed heavily. Five years on it’s still trying to raise a follow-on fund. An Alcentra spokesperson says the firm’s overall assets under management have been “stable” since Franklin’s takeover was completed in November 2022, and that it has seen “strong momentum and performance” in other parts of the business: “Over the last 12 months, we’ve seen successful fund closes and significant fundraising traction in our structured credit and special situations vintages, as well as inflows into our European liquid credit strategies.” Nevertheless, the travails of its direct-lending fund carry a warning for the private credit asset class more broadly. Funds that can’t keep up with returns offered by peers, or who lose staff, are finding it hard to bring in new money as unforgiving investors increasingly put their faith in the promised stability of private capital’s biggest beasts. “More firms have issues now that were previously not apparent,” says Andrew Bellis, head of private debt at Partners Group, speaking generally about the market rather than Alcentra. “There will be a shakeout in the industry, but that happens over a long period of time. We might look back and say, ‘What happened to that firm that used to be big?’” First-Mover Advantage Alcentra was an early mover into European direct lending along with fellow pioneers Ares, ICG and Arcmont Asset Management. But even as this industry has flourished — as private firms muscle in on the lucrative corporate loan business once dominated by Wall Street — the trailblazer has floundered. While rivals have been targeting fundraisings comfortably over €10 billion and expanding their direct-lending arms, Alcentra is the odd one out. Its latest fund for this market was registered in Luxembourg more than four years ago and, so far, there’s been no public statement about it reaching any milestones. Franklin’s acquisition was part of a major expansion in alternative assets by the $1.6 trillion investment giant after buying Lexington Partners, a private equity fund manager. Franklin and its ilk have been drawn to private markets by the allure of higher returns and as a way to win back clients who’ve shunned more traditional actively-managed stock and bond funds. Franklin has been one of the asset managers most affected by outflows in recent years, with clients pulling about $176 billion from its funds since 2019, according to Morningstar Inc. It’s also dealing with the fallout of another, more traditional acquisition. Ken Leech, the former star trader of Western Asset Management Co., which Franklin bought through its acquisition of Legg Mason, has been charged by the US for alleged fraud. “Franklin Templeton manages $250 billion in alternative assets, and the Alcentra business is an important part of our offering in the alternative credit space,” a spokesperson for the company says. Part of the problem for Alcentra’s direct-lending arm has been performance. The fund manager has been involved in several debt-for-equity swaps since 2019, according to Bloomberg research, a sign that things weren’t going well for these companies. These include Lifetime Training, an apprenticeship training provider that struggled to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, and Caroola (previously known as Optionis), a professional services provider that was crippled by a cyber hack in 2022, according to public filings. One Alcentra investor, Strathclyde Pension Fund, said at a recent meeting that the lender provided a 6.7% return over the last year, according to documents seen by Bloomberg, while two other private-debt investments, Barings and Partners Group, delivered 10.9% and 11.1%. Since the start of Strathclyde's investment, however, Alcentra does stack up well against its peers. Strathclyde was candid about where some of the more recent issues arose: “Alcentra has suffered from a high level of senior turnover and has had a change of ownership.” The pension fund has decided to run off its investment, according to the documents, meaning it won’t put any more money in. “The one thing you want to see is consistency in deal performance and the team,” says Vasileios Kocheilas, a seasoned investor in private credit funds. “Investing is about finding the right people to do the right things.” As smaller private credit firms find it tougher to deliver that consistency, and to get new fundraising off the ground, private-capital behemoths such as Blackstone Inc. and Ares are taking the lion’s share of the market’s growth. Investors, known as limited partners, are voting with their feet. “LPs have to make tough decisions on which managers to back,” says Mike Dennis, partner and co-head of European credit at Ares, speaking generally about the market. “We’re seeing LPs consolidate their manager relationships because of liquidity constraints. And for some of those small managers, it’s very difficult to say what their differentiation is.” Size isn’t everything, however. Some of the old titans of traditional money management haven’t cracked this red-hot asset class. Fidelity International halted its early European direct-lending activities this year. BlackRock will hope that buying a premium outfit like HPS will spare any pain, even if it isn’t cheap. At the less exalted end of the private credit market, some are bracing for the emergence of zombie funds, so-called because they own a bunch of illiquid assets and are struggling to raise cash to buy more. Instead, they begin a slow process of withering away. It’s a familiar sight in private equity, where hundreds of firms are in that unhappy position. In private credit, the assets are loans with fixed maturities — so, unlike equity, a fund can’t stumble on forever. But a firm’s future is predicated on its ability to raise more capital and keep scaling. As this nascent asset class matures, subpar performance may lead to a sticky end. “We’re going to see more zombie funds as credit managers will have had so many problematic deals that no one will be willing to give them any more money,” Kocheilas concludes. --With assistance from Loukia Gyftopoulou.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reached new record highs on Friday, supported by slightly stronger-than-expected November jobs data that likely won’t deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates later this month. The S&P 500 gained 0.25% to finish at 6,090.27, while the Nasdaq advanced 0.81% to 19,859.77, driven by strong performances from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both indexes hit all-time highs during the session and closed at new peaks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 123.19 points, or 0.28%, ending the day at 44,642.52. For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their third consecutive weekly gains, rising 0.96% and 3.34%, respectively. The Dow, however, edged down 0.6% over the same period. Friday’s jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 227,000 in November, surpassing the Dow Jones forecast of 214,000 and reflecting a sharp rebound from October’s upwardly revised gain of 36,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, in line with expectations. Much of the focus this week will be on incoming inflation data, with the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) set to be released on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. JPMorgan strategists anticipate the CPI to show a 0.3% increase in the core index. They note that it would take a significant surprise in the data to alter their expectations for the Federal Reserve’s policy trajectory. "With the blackout period beginning this weekend, we doubt Fed officials will want to go into the December meeting with the same amount of drama as preceded the September meeting," strategists led by Michael Feroli said in a note. On the producer price front, the strategists estimate a 0.2% rise in the final demand producer price index (PPI) for November, consistent with October’s pace. Energy prices are expected to edge up by 0.3% following three consecutive months of declines, while food prices are projected to firm slightly with a 0.2% increase, reversing October’s 0.2% dip. Excluding food and energy, they forecast core PPI to rise by 0.2%, aligning with its trend in recent months. However, they foresee a modest slowdown in core goods PPI growth, projecting a 0.1% increase for November compared to the stronger 0.3% gain in October. Separately, Citi strategists said a softer core CPI this week “should also shift Fed and market attention away from sticky inflation and towards softening jobs.” The Wall Street firm expects a 25 basis point (bp) cut from the Fed at its meeting next week, and for cuts to continue at upcoming meetings to a terminal rate of 3.00-3.25%. This week also brings several important updates on the earnings front. Investors and analysts will get a chance to dive into new financial results from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among others. Broadcom, a key AI player, has delivered impressive performance this year, with a 60% stock gain year-to-date. The outperformance has been driven by strong growth fueled by its AI compute and networking businesses. Moreover, VMware (NYSE:VMW), acquired by Broadcom over a year ago, appears on track to achieve its $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate and $12 billion annual target. Oppenheimer: “We are initiating our price target for the S&P 500 for 2025 at 7100 by year-end. This is 16.7% above last Friday’s close and implies a 25.8x multiple over our earnings forecast of $275.” “In the equity markets companies in all eleven sectors could benefit from improved productivity via AI to further serve the needs of business and customers.” Citi: “We maintain a positive view on US equities headed into 2025. A base case 6500 S&P 500 target allows for mid-single digit gains on the heels of back- to-back 20%+ years. Ongoing soft landing and Artificial Intelligence tailwinds now interact with Trump policy promises, and risks. Continued broadening beyond Mega Cap Growth impacts is critical but an extended valuation starting point will be an ongoing hurdle. Our bull and bear case assumptions help frame an expectation for increased volatility next year.” BCA Research: “The labor market is in the midst of an unusual limbo in which job creation (hiring) and destruction (layoffs) are both muted. We expect that continued softening will eventually provoke a wave of layoffs, triggering a vicious circle in which shrinking payrolls beget slower spending, begetting further payroll contraction and still slower spending growth until businesses slash discretionary investment and a recession ensues. While we expect the recession will be mild and brief, we nonetheless expect the S&P 500 will suffer a bear market.” UBS: “With risks either not materializing or investors not paying much attention to them as the holidays approach, the path of least resistance is for the markets to keep rallying. In-line inflation data this week and the Fed cutting 25bps next week don’t guarantee this as these outcomes should be largely priced in. But absent negative news flow, upward momentum tends to be self-reinforcing, supported by investors chasing the rally. The trade-off is that it sets up the markets for a correction in 1Q should the data or policy fall short of expectations." Evercore ISI: “While S&P 500 TTM P/E at 25x is lofty, exuberance has not become irrational, nor have asset prices gone “too far” as to put the end of the Bull Market in sight. Valuations are not extreme “enough” with the Fed cutting and the Economy still strong, unlike the Dot.Com and Housing bubbles. The sentiment is optimistic but not yet universally so. And the market cap of speculation hotspots Crypto + TSLA at less than $5T are not meaningful enough in proportion to cause a broad dislocation on a pullback.”

Energy prices are expected to edge up by 0.3% following three consecutive months of declines, while food prices are projected to firm slightly with a 0.2% increase, reversing October’s 0.2% dip. Excluding food and energy, they forecast core PPI to rise by 0.2%, aligning with its trend in recent months. However, they foresee a modest slowdown in core goods PPI growth, projecting a 0.1% increase for November compared to the stronger 0.3% gain in October. Separately, Citi strategists said a softer core CPI this week “should also shift Fed and market attention away from sticky inflation and towards softening jobs.” The Wall Street firm expects a 25 basis point (bp) cut from the Fed at its meeting next week, and for cuts to continue at upcoming meetings to a terminal rate of 3.00-3.25%. This week also brings several important updates on the earnings front. Investors and analysts will get a chance to dive into new financial results from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among others. Broadcom, a key AI player, has delivered impressive performance this year, with a 60% stock gain year-to-date. The outperformance has been driven by strong growth fueled by its AI compute and networking businesses. Moreover, VMware (NYSE:VMW), acquired by Broadcom over a year ago, appears on track to achieve its $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate and $12 billion annual target. Oppenheimer: “We are initiating our price target for the S&P 500 for 2025 at 7100 by year-end. This is 16.7% above last Friday’s close and implies a 25.8x multiple over our earnings forecast of $275.” “In the equity markets companies in all eleven sectors could benefit from improved productivity via AI to further serve the needs of business and customers.” Citi: “We maintain a positive view on US equities headed into 2025. A base case 6500 S&P 500 target allows for mid-single digit gains on the heels of back- to-back 20%+ years. Ongoing soft landing and Artificial Intelligence tailwinds now interact with Trump policy promises, and risks. Continued broadening beyond Mega Cap Growth impacts is critical but an extended valuation starting point will be an ongoing hurdle. Our bull and bear case assumptions help frame an expectation for increased volatility next year.” BCA Research: “The labor market is in the midst of an unusual limbo in which job creation (hiring) and destruction (layoffs) are both muted. We expect that continued softening will eventually provoke a wave of layoffs, triggering a vicious circle in which shrinking payrolls beget slower spending, begetting further payroll contraction and still slower spending growth until businesses slash discretionary investment and a recession ensues. While we expect the recession will be mild and brief, we nonetheless expect the S&P 500 will suffer a bear market.” UBS: “With risks either not materializing or investors not paying much attention to them as the holidays approach, the path of least resistance is for the markets to keep rallying. In-line inflation data this week and the Fed cutting 25bps next week don’t guarantee this as these outcomes should be largely priced in. But absent negative news flow, upward momentum tends to be self-reinforcing, supported by investors chasing the rally. The trade-off is that it sets up the markets for a correction in 1Q should the data or policy fall short of expectations." Evercore ISI: “While S&P 500 TTM P/E at 25x is lofty, exuberance has not become irrational, nor have asset prices gone “too far” as to put the end of the Bull Market in sight. Valuations are not extreme “enough” with the Fed cutting and the Economy still strong, unlike the Dot.Com and Housing bubbles. The sentiment is optimistic but not yet universally so. And the market cap of speculation hotspots Crypto + TSLA at less than $5T are not meaningful enough in proportion to cause a broad dislocation on a pullback.”

Title: China investigates Nvidia over suspected violation of antimonopoly law

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Liam Mo and Brenda Goh BEIJING (Reuters) -China said on Monday it has launched an investigation into Nvidia over suspected violations of the country's anti-monopoly law, a probe widely seen as a retaliatory shot against Washington's latest curbs on the Chinese chip sector. The statement from the State Administration for Market Regulation announcing the probe did not elaborate on how the U.S. company, known for its artificial intelligence and gaming chips, might have violated China's anti-monopoly laws. It said the U.S. chipmaker was also suspected of violating commitments it made during its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, under terms outlined in the regulator's 2020 conditional approval of that deal. The announcement is the latest salvo in a long-running trade war between China and the United States as the countries vie for technological superiority. Last week, four of China's top industry associations issued a rare and coordinated response saying that Chinese companies should be wary of buying U.S. chips as they were "no longer safe" and should buy locally instead. Nvidia's shares closed 2.5% lower on Monday. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company worked hard to "provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business," adding that "we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business". TECHnalysis Research chief analyst Bob O'Donnell told Reuters that the probe is unlikely to have much of an impact on the company, particularly in the near term, because most of Nvidia’s most advanced chips are already restricted from being sold into China. The investigation comes after the U.S. last week launched its third crackdown in three years on China's semiconductor industry, which saw Washington curb exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment makers. Shortly after Washington's announcement, Beijing banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony. Nvidia is one of many companies caught up in U.S.-China friction. U.S. sanctions in 2022 banned shipments of A100 and H100 AI chips to China, leading Nvidia to develop modified versions. These China-specific variants were later restricted under tightened U.S. controls in October 2023, prompting Nvidia to release another set of modified chips for the Chinese market. "It's clear that the Chinese government is trying to react against recent restrictions from the U.S., but their ability to impact the U.S. semiconductor industry continues to decrease over time," O'Donnell said. Nvidia dominated China's AI chip market with a more than 90% share before those curbs. However, it faces increasing competition from domestic rivals, chief among them being Huawei. China accounted for around 17% of Nvidia's revenue in the year to the end of January, sliding from 26% two years earlier. In 2020, the company won a key approval from China for its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, to the relief of investors who felt Sino-U.S. trade friction could complicate the process. Nvidia and the merged entity were set multiple conditions, requiring them to supply GPU accelerators to the Chinese market on "fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory" terms. The companies must also provide customers and distributors the opportunity to purchase up to one year's inventory of Nvidia GPU accelerators and Mellanox networking equipment under these terms. The conditions also prohibit forced product bundling, unreasonable trading terms, purchase restrictions and discriminatory treatment of customers who buy products separately. The last time China launched an anti-monopoly probe into a high-profile foreign technology firm was in 2013, when it investigated Qualcomm's local subsidiary for overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. Qualcomm later agreed to pay a fine of $975 million, which was the largest China had ever handed out to a company at the time.

December 09, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Dec. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from a single and remarkably high-grade diamond drill hole recently completed at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. OB-24-347 was a shallow hole drilled at the eastern margin of the historic O’Brien Gold Mine workings. At approximately 200 metres vertical depth it intersected 643.1 grams per tonne (“g/t”) gold (“Au”) over 2.1 metres, including 1,345.0 g/t Au over 1.0 metre. The extensive nuggety-gold and high silicification suggest that the hole has intersected the near-surface extension of the famous O’Brien “Jewellery Box”, a mining stope believed to be the source of extremely high-grade and museum quality gold samples. Video of the core is available HERE. Matt Manson, President & CEO, commented: “When the O’Brien Gold Mine was operational between 1926 and 1957, it was known for very high grades and spectacular specimens of visible gold, many of which are now in the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum. The source of some of the best specimens was thought to be the Jewellery Box stope, a narrow, vertical grade-shoot extending from 250 metres depth to at least 750 metres depth. At the time, exploration drifts were developed to try to find this zone above the 250 metres level, without success. Now, drill-hole OB-24-347 has intersected what we believe is the same Jewellery Box zone marginally offset to the east. We intend to now trace it to the surface with additional drilling and expose it with stripping. This is being planned for our 2025 exploration program. Steeply plunging high-grade shoots are characteristic of the O’Brien Gold Project. The Jewellery Box Stope was always the best of these. Its potential re-discovery offers very high value, low-hanging fruit for a future O’Brien mine.” Figure 1: Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB-24-347Matt Manson continued: “Our 2024 drill program of 35,000 metres has comprised a combination of shallower holes, such as with today’s news, and deeper holes exploring the full depth potential of O’Brien gold mineralization. Of note, we have recently completed drill hole OB-24-337, the first hole ever drilled directly below the historic mine and, at 1,700 metres, the deepest hole ever drilled at the Project. The results from this hole are expected to be released shortly.” Figure 2: Long Section and Plan View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with the Location of OB-24-347 Illustrated. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring in contact with the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac and footwall Cadillac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on the modern drilling, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.60 million tonnes at 8.66 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trend #s 0 to 5”). Figure 3: More Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB 24-347. Table 1: Detailed Assay Results from Drill Hole OB-24-347 Notes on Calculation of Drill InterceptsThe O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. This methodology differs from previous Radisson disclosure, and intercepts reported in this release may not be directly comparable to historical published intercepts. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 30-70% of core length.

Title: A Bitcoin Miner Promised To Help A Texas Town. It Went Bankrupt Instead. Now, It’s Pivoting To AI

Time Published: 2024-12-09T11:30:00Z

Three years ago, one of the world’s largest bitcoin miners offered a lifeline to the town of Denton, Texas, a community burdened with tens of millions of dollars in debt. The miner, Core Scientific, wanted to build a data center in the city. In exchange for a massive power contract that would double Denton’s energy footprint, the company would provide much needed revenue in the form of taxes and fees. Denton accepted. But within months of powering on, Core Scientific filed for bankruptcy after being saddled with its own outstanding debt. Now, on the heels of the artificial intelligence boom, Core Scientific has reinvented itself as a cloud computing company for AI startups. Last month, the former crypto miner announced that its Denton facility will transform into what it claims will be one of the largest AI supercomputers in North America. It received a green light from Denton’s local government to increase its previously 297-megawatt (MW) power agreement by another 100 MWs, enough to run nearly 400,000 homes — a capacity larger than Elon Musk’s “Colossus” supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee. Many industrial bitcoin miners have pivoted their operations to AI in hopes of boosting revenue streams after the volatile 2022 market downturn known as “crypto winter.” Companies like Core Scientific, Hut 8, Bitdeer and Terawulf have all retrofitted data centers to accommodate racks of high-end chips needed to train AI models. In June, Core Scientific announced a $3.5 billion contract with AI hyperscaler CoreWeave to provide the data center space needed to host a massive array of Nvidia H100 GPUs, for which it has allocated 200 MWs worth of power. News of the partnership sparked a $4 billion increase in the market cap of 14 bitcoin miners with similar computing resources, according to JP Morgan. In Denton, Core Scientific spent nearly three years developing datacenters to mine crypto before deciding to make the switch. The transition is a relatively simple one — Core Scientific has retired its mining machines, and will be updating existing buildings to support rows of GPU servers. The Austin-based company was founded in 2017 by Aber Whitcomb, who previously cofounded Myspace, along with Darin Feinstein and CEO Mike Levitt. Over the following years, it opened a number of facilities across the southern U.S. In 2023, after filing for bankruptcy, it received a $500 million loan from creditors including BlackRock and Apollo Global Manager. Last month, the miner reported $95 million in third quarter revenue and $415 million in revenue for the year. It currently operates nine data centers in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, North Dakota and Texas. Core Scientific did not initially disclose its identity to the public, and one city council member who voted against the proposal called it a “deal with the devil” Core Scientific was drawn to Denton because of its abundance of electricity and cheap real estate. At the time, the city’s local power utility, Denton Municipal Electric (DME), had recently incurred $210 million in electricity fees during a historic winter storm in 2021 that caused energy costs to skyrocket. When Core Scientific proposed building its data center in town — a project that would supposedly deliver the utility up to $8 million a year in revenue — DME was $140 million in debt. But residents and some Denton city officials were skeptical of the project because of its secretive nature and large energy footprint. Core Scientific did not initially disclose its identity to the public, and one city council member who voted against the proposal called it a “deal with the devil,” BuzzFeed News previously reported. Another council member said, “We don’t need to allow an unidentified company to use our city’s infrastructure to increase greenhouse gas emissions for the sole purpose of turning a profit.” But they ultimately supported the project after DME convinced them that Core Scientific would shoulder 100% of the risk. Got a story tip? Contact Sarah Emerson on Signal at 510-473-8820 or email semerson@forbes.com. Denton’s partnership with Core Scientific was announced in October 2021 and its facility became operational four months later. In December 2022, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after experiencing $434 million in losses the preceding quarter, citing liquidity issues caused by a number of factors including energy costs and bitcoin prices that fell by 60% that year. It opted not to liquidate and continue mining crypto, but halted the completion of its Denton facility, which left two large buildings unfinished. In January of this year, Core Scientific restructured $400 million in debt and received court approval to exit bankruptcy. A few months later, it had signed an AI computing contract with CoreWeave. CoreWeave has ridden the AI wave to a $1.5 billion valuation and reported $250 million in revenue last year. As one of the primary distributors of Nvidia chips, it’s found a niche renting on-demand compute space to AI startups. Last year, it struck a deal with Microsoft to provide potentially billions of dollars worth of GPUs to support Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI. Core Scientific’s bankruptcy meant that Denton “received less than originally anticipated” because the project was never fully built out, Stuart Birdseye, spokesperson for Denton’s power utility DME, told Forbes. DME earned $2.3 million in revenue from the data center last year, according to the North Texas Daily, though Birdseye told Forbes that income from Core Scientific “was a net positive for the city in total.” Now, it stands to bring in much more. In addition to an increased power capacity, Core Scientific will lease more than 40 new acres of land near its facility for an AI computing campus. The company’s proposed $6.1 billion property investment is expected to result in $194 million in property tax revenue for the city over the first 10 years after the build-out is complete some time in 2027, the city said. Neither DME nor Core Scientific elaborated on how that money will be distributed over time. City manager Sara Hensley said in a statement that the site will “serve as a model for high-performing computing innovation” as Denton courts other high-tech investments. AI data centers, which typically run continuously, have yet to show the same willingness to halt processing voluntarily if local electricity demands surge In a recent announcement, Denton’s government also claimed the project will create “an estimated 300 full-time, on-site positions, and over 200 independent jobs from entities that would support the operation.” A Core Scientific spokesperson told Forbes that “actual hiring plans have not been finalized but we believe most of the jobs created will be filled locally.” Similar to the development of its crypto mining operation, Core Scientific will assume the cost of updating transmission infrastructure, such as two new substations that will be needed to accommodate its larger power load. The company would only disclose CoreWeave as a customer for the Denton site; the startup counts among its customers Microsoft and Nvidia. Unlike Core Scientific’s mining center, however, its supercomputer will not be immediately participating in a program known as “demand response” that requires large power customers to limit their operations when energy demands are spiking. Many of the bitcoin giants that flocked to Texas during the crypto boom touted their ability to shut down at a moment’s notice, since it was easy to halt mining as needed. Some even profited from an arrangement with ERCOT, the state’s power grid operator, which allowed them to sell back pre-purchased electricity on the energy marketplace. Last year, the miner Riot Platforms reportedly earned $31 million from ERCOT this way. AI data centers, which typically run continuously, have yet to show the same willingness to halt processing voluntarily if local electricity demands surge, such as during a storm. Previously, Core Scientific was also enrolled in ERCOT’s demand response program, but told Forbes it will “reassess our ability to participate” after the computing equipment is installed. Birdseye said DME still has the ability to interrupt the facility’s power supply when the grid is stressed, but did not elaborate on how those instances will be handled with Core Scientific. In Memphis, where Elon Musk has said his xAI supercomputer will host 1 million GPUs, the state’s power utility has required the company to enroll in its own demand response program. Moving forward, the city insists that Core Scientific’s expansion will not derail its environmental goals. Since 2020, Denton has offset 100% of its energy footprint mostly through local renewable energy contracts, and claims to be the first Texas city to do so. BuzzFeed News had reported that Core Scientific’s crypto mine involved the buying of “renewable energy credits” or RECs, which are a controversial accounting mechanism allowing companies to offset their emissions on paper. “This will continue to be the case as the city’s energy needs increase, which includes this development,” said Birdseye, who added that staff are “currently analyzing these future needs and is developing a strategy to continue with this process.”

JP Morgan headquarters at Canary Wharf financial district on 5th November 2024 in London, United ... [+] Kingdom. (photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images) JPMorgan stock (NYSE: JPM) has gained about 48% year-to-date, compared to the 28% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. JPMorgan’s peer Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) is up by an even stronger 50% YTD. Let’s take a look at JPM’s recent performance and outlook. JPMorgan outperformed street expectations in the third quarter of FY 2024. The bank reported total revenues of $42.7 billion, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year. Net interest income was slightly higher compared to last year, due to changes in the balance sheet mix, higher credit card balances, as well as wholesale deposits. Separately, for another strong stock this year see What’s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock? Non-interest revenue, excluding the markets segment, grew by a strong 17% led by higher asset management fees as well as an improved investment banking performance. However, net income was down by about 2% compared to last year at $12.9 billion on account of higher provisions for credit losses. As an aside, why is VALE down 40% this year? See What’s Happening With VALE Stock? Admirably, JPM stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and 31% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, what’s the outlook like for JPMorgan? Separately, see why Citi stock is also having a good year in Why Citi Stock Is Up 40% This Year. Looking ahead, things could get better. The company’s net interest income could improve in Q4 driven in part by the Federal Reserve rate cuts which started in September. Separately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as JPMorgan. Republicans, who generally favor free markets, have won control of the Senate and the House of Representatives as well. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. While JPMorgan remains one of the highest quality names in the banking space, with considerable scale, we believe the stock is overvalued. JPM stock trades at over 2.5x tangible book value (company’s net assets, less goodwill) which is elevated in our view. Overall, at its current price of $245 per share, JPM is trading about 15% ahead of Trefis’ estimate for JPMorgan’s valuation.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: ““It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.” – Albert Einstein (1933) Number of the Week: Over 7 days THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: Discussed in This Week is the failure of wind and solar plus a battery to deliver power needed for a small, isolated community, population 20,000, in Australia. Also discussed is the need to separate two distinct properties of water vapor when considering the greenhouse effect. An extensive list of general failures of climate models is presented. An interpretation of the failure of the recent UN COP meeting is given. Suggestions for improving US weather prediction are made. A disturbing interview, if facts are verified, is presented. ****************** The Potemkin Village: For a decade, engineers such as the late Roger Andrews have discussed the tremendous electricity storage requirements needed to supply electricity when wind and solar fail. Thus far the largest storage facilities have been pumped hydro-storage first developed in Switzerland over 100 years ago. Such facilities must be replenished on a timely basis, otherwise they fail. Timely replenishment requires reliable power, such as from hydrocarbons or nuclear. Two experiments to run exclusively on wind and solar power have failed. One was on El Hierro (population about 13,000) in the Canary Islands and the second on King Island (population about 1,500) off Tasmania – hardly complex modern cities with huge energy needs. Commentators such as Francis Menton have called for a demonstration project showing that a modern city or community can thrive on wind and solar plus storage. In an essay on Climate, Etc. utility planning engineer Russell Schussler discusses a third experiment. He writes: “In October of 2024, the isolated small city of Broken Hill in New South Wales, Australia with a 36 MW load (including the large nearby mines) could not be reliably served by 200 MW of wind, a 53 MW solar array, significant residential solar, and a large 50 MW battery all supplemented by diesel generators. Many people falsely believe that wind, solar and batteries have been demonstrated to provide grid support and deliver energy independently in large real word applications. Few people realize that we are a long way away from having wind, solar and batteries support a large power system without significant amounts of conventional spinning generation (nuclear, gas, coal, hydro, geothermal) on-line to support the grid. Broken Hill Outage – Wind, Solar and Battery Can Not Support the Grid The recent outages occurring in Broken Hill help illustrate the inability of wind, solar and batteries to support electric grids without significant help from machines rotating in synchronism with the grid. (Note – wind power is produced by rotation but not in synchronism with the grid). Around 20,000 people live in the Broken Hill area. Over $650 million in investment made Broken Hill home to a 200 MW wind plant, a 53 MW solar array, and a large battery that could provide 50 MW of power for 100 MWh through advanced grid forming inverters. Broken Hill is home to over 6,000 small-scale solar systems providing a per capita energy small solar production level almost twice the Australian average. The area also contains two poorly maintained diesel-powered gas turbine generators in the area, one which was off-line for maintenance. Broken Hill became renewable energy industry’s Potemkin Village: In 2018, Broken Hill City Council announced its goal to become Australia’s first carbon-free city by 2030. Three years ago, then mayor Darriea Turley welcomed the announcement that AGL was proceeding with plans to build a grid-scale battery, which the company claimed would be a reliable backup power source for 10,000 homes. “This is a great opportunity for Broken Hill and renewable energies,” Turley told the ABC. “What they will see is when there is an outage, the battery would click into operation.” In October of 2024, this area was separated from the larger grid when the interconnecting transmission towers went down in a bad storm. Loads in Broken Hill are limited to about 20 MW of mining load and 17 MW that serve the local town for a combined load of 36 MW. The over 300 MWs of renewable energy from wind, solar and battery storage, along with a diesel generator were not able to provide reliable power to support the town alone.” Schussler gives a graph of the nameplate capacity of the resources and the loads then states: “A 25 MW gas plant or a 25 MW hydro plant would have done a much better job than the combined efforts of 200 MW of wind, 53 MW of solar, the 34 MW of distributed solar and 50 MW battery. The consequences for Broken Hill were serious. The Australian ran an article entitled: Broken Hill: Powerless and left to live like mushrooms where it described the situation: ‘The power comes on from time to time but goes out just as quickly. It gives us just enough time to power our phones and read emails from energy providers sent the day before, alerting us to the fact the power was about to go out. They also warn we don’t have much time, and to avoid using unnecessary electrical devices – air conditioners, fridges or fans that need a power point.’ In theory the area could be served, but in reality, as noted by Jo Nova, ‘The fridges in the pharmacies failed, so all medications had to be destroyed, and emergency replacements sent in. Schools have been closed. Freezers of meat are long gone… Emergency trucks are bringing in food finally.’” Schussler discusses the big differences between theory and practice which often occur. In theory, the battery at Broken Hill should have worked, but it didn’t. Failure to recognize this difference leads to fuzzy thinking about Microgrids. Microgrids with batteries require the same battery capacity as needed to meet the longest period in which there is little or no electrical generation. These periods of time are grossly underestimated by wind and solar promoters and their political collaborators. [For a current example, Cliff Mass reports that a formidable pool of cold, dense cloud-laden air has settled within the Columbia River Basin, resulting in virtually no power generation from all the wind turbines for a whole week. Wind power is often over 2,000 megawatts, and accounts for over 10% of the generation capacity of the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) Balancing Authority Area. Of course, BPA relies on the largest hydro-generation system in the US, which some local politicians such as the governor of Washington State are trying to shut down.] Schussler concludes his revealing essay with: “Australia has been much hyped recently as a pioneer in renewables, but the cracks are showing. There are many other stories of emerging problems that could be shared. Germany was the leader before. All that hype has crumbled, showing the Energiewende as a pipe dream with a poison pill. There is a simple point that is being widely ignored: wind, solar and batteries do not support the grid much. There are many tricks employed to help proponents and policy makers overlook this simple fact but eventually reality will hammer the point home. Many excuses for this outage will likely emerge. I’ve heard that changing the battery setting made it more effective than it was initially. Undoubtedly inverter-based technology will continue to improve and wind and solar with the proper settings and equipment will be able to contribute better. While inverter-based generation with computer control may one day provide a lot of options, such technology will also provide tremendous complexity and challenges as well. Who will know how to make so many elements with unlimited potential operating characteristics behave well together across a multitude of potential unknown and unpredictable situations? Experience with the grid has come from many decades of study and practice. As the penetration of inverter-based resources increases I suspect every outage study after the fact will continue to find that the inverter setting could have been better. Many can argue that the grid at Broken Hill could or should have worked better (although the failure was likely beyond their worst fears). That’s typically true for any grid during any outage. To quote Nick Cater again., “If wind, solar and storage can’t keep the beer cold in a small city like Broken Hill, how will it perform when called upon to power the rest of the country?” Policy makers pushing for standalone power systems built primarily on wind, solar and batteries are lurching towards disaster and will only avoid calamity to the extent that they are unsuccessful in their goals of removing conventional rotating machinery or are able to lean on the despised conventional technology of their interconnected neighbors.” In addition, Paul Homewood discusses that for wind power, batteries are needed to balance wind power frequency for the grid. This should not be confused with electricity storage for the grid. In National Grid & The Hornsea Battery, he writes: “The storage will be 600 MWh and is not designed to ‘be used when needed.’ Hornsea 3 will have a capacity of 2.9 GW, so 600 MWh would only be enough to last 12 minutes when the wind stops blowing. Its real role is to balance grid frequency, as wind output can fluctuate even on a minute-to-minute basis.” One problem seldom mentioned by commentators pertains to re-powering the grid which for some reason has gone down. Imagine a small grid drawing (say) 100 MW normally supplied by a combination of solar, wind, and batteries, that suddenly goes down. Residents, businesses, hospitals, and small factories have lights, motors, refrigerators, computers, and instruments of all kinds turned on and waiting for power. Re-powering that location requires the sudden change from zero power to 100 MW, with all generators synchronized to within a few milliseconds. What can easily be accomplished by a single 100-MW generator becomes an impossible dream with the distributed power sources. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy, Changing Weather, and Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Energy – Storage. ****************** Two Processes Not One: On her blog Jennifer Marohasy posted an audio interview with William Kininmonth with summaries and slides. Kininmonth was the head of Australia’s National Climate Centre at the Bureau of Meteorology from 1986 to 1998. He asserts that oceans warm the atmosphere as opposed to the atmosphere warms the oceans as claimed by many global warming advocates. The infrared radiation given off greenhouse gases cannot penetrate beyond a few centimeters of ocean, fractions of an inch; thus, the atmosphere does not warm the ocean, while sunlight and geothermal events at the bottom do. Unfortunately, Kininmonth combines two properties of water vapor; one property applies to water vapor alone, the other to all greenhouse gases. This has been a common problems since John Tyndall discovered that certain gases in the atmosphere absorb heat energy emitted by Earth, slowing (blocking) the release of that energy to space; thus, slowing Earth’s heat loss. This explained why the land masses of Earth stay warm enough at night to support growing plants, and life itself. With his experiments in spectroscopy beginning in 1859, Tyndall eventually identified that the dominant greenhouse gas was water vapor, giving rise to the confusion. Water involves two distinct processes and one, the water cycle, applies to it alone. Water evaporates, creating water vapor which requires heat for the phase change. Thus, water vapor contains what is called latent heat, which is predominantly from sunlight and some geothermal energy. Convection brings it from the surface of Earth into the upper troposphere which is cooler than the surface and lower troposphere. In the upper troposphere water vapor condenses into liquid water giving off latent heat. The second process of interest is the interaction between heat radiation (infrared, IR) and individual H2O molecules (called water vapor by chemists). Due to a plethora of vibrational and rotational modes of the H2O molecules, they can both absorb and emit IR at a very wide range of wavelengths (“colors,” for lack of a better word). Collisions with atmospheric molecules can energize H2O molecules, which can then radiate IR. Equally, collisions can remove energy, reducing the amount of IR emitted by H2O molecules. The details of these energy-transfer processes depend on atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature, and the exact wavelength under consideration; and are carefully calculated by experts like van Wijngaarden and Happer. Such interactions among molecules and IR are loosely termed the greenhouse effect. However, the greenhouse effect is defined by the IPCC as the numerical difference between the amount of IR emitted by the surface and the amount of IR sent to space. The work of van Wijngaarden and Happer recognizes the distinction between the water cycle, which is a driver of convection, and the greenhouse effect. Consequently, they are able to demonstrate how water vapor interferes with the effectiveness of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, rendering them ineffective as greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere. Unfortunately, William Kininmonth fails to make the important distinction between the role of water vapor in the water cycle and the role of water vapor in the greenhouse effect. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer and Challenging the Orthodoxy. ****************** Global Climate Model Failure: General Circulation Models, now called Global Climate Models, fail to consider the geological prospective of Earth. We are in a brief warm period during Icehouse Earth with ice caps at both ends. We have no ability to predict when it will end, and glaciation will return. Further, the models cannot predict Dansgaard–Oeschger events (often abbreviated D–O events) and Bond cycles, rapid changes in temperatures which occur every, roughly, 1,500 years – rapid warming followed by slow cooling. John Robson produced a video interview with Javier Vinós along with a post stating some of the many failures of Global Climate Models that Vinós uncovered. Climate change is an extremely complex topic with many uncertainties. To say that the science is settled is absurd. For that reason, TWTW prefers to focus on one of the uncertainties for which we can collect proper data and determine its influence, the role of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide. The best physical evidence indicates that adding carbon dioxide in today’s atmosphere has a minor impact on influencing temperatures. For topics on which the models fail see links under Model Issues. ****************** UN Failure: Writing in American Thinker, retired economics professor William Hawkins gives an account why the annual UN Conference of Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have failed to produce binding agreements that have been long sought by some, despite the flashy headlines of dire outcomes if agreements are not reached. Hawkins writes: “The United Nations has been looking for issues deemed larger than the perennial conflicts of traditional geopolitics. It created the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 to acquire the authority to run the global economy so as to “save the planet” and “equitably” share the benefits of “sustainable” (i.e., limited) development. It holds a massive conference (over 65,000 attendees) towards the end of each year staged as if governments were adhering to UN mandates. The 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) in the FCCC series concluded Saturday (Nov. 23) in Baku, Azerbaijan. It ran a day over the two-week schedule as compromise language was hammered out that would allow member states to do as they pleased. As much as the UN bureaucrats hate to admit, the UN is still a member organization, with the world’s leading national governments making the real decisions as to the policies they will adopt to advance the best interests of their citizens. There are no UN mandates. This concept was formally eliminated at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009. That meeting was the peak of the FCCC campaign with a massive buildup by activist groups around the world for the two years prior. President Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to encourage him to commit to the UN climate agenda that President George W. Bush had rejected. COP15 was supposed to adopt a “legally binding” treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The plan had been to impose on the “rich” developed countries a requirement that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions be cut by 25-to-40 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels. Such a drastic measure would have locked the developed countries into a permanent recession. Meanwhile, the developing countries, led by the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, and China) coalition, would not have had any mandated restrictions on their GHG emissions because they have a sovereign “right” to economic growth. The terminology was “common but differentiated responsibilities.” All must be concerned, but only some (the West) need to do anything about it. In the last days of COP15, President Obama met directly with the BASIC delegates and told them either everyone has a mandate to act, or no one does. The frank result was no one has a mandate. Instead, each nation is simply “called upon” to report to the UN what they are doing about climate change (if anything). The look back at COP15 is important in understanding COP29, as the division between the developed and the developing countries was at the center of the negotiations with the latter again insisting on the old, discarded Kyoto formula. The purpose of the Baku summit was much reduced from past meetings, reflecting the evolution of thought of member states against the demands of the UN bureaucrats. This was apparent in last year’s COP28 held in Dubai (a site which like Baku is based on oil production) There were commitments to triple renewables capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030 and to make progress on adapting to any climate change that occurs rather than curtail (or even reverse) energy use and other human activities in an attempt to prevent climate changes. The favored approach was incremental and cost-conscious. The final language called for “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner” (giving plenty of wiggle room) while the term “phasing out” fossil fuels was rejected.” Hawkins discusses that despite dire predictions, the US Energy Information Administration projections show energy use will increase by over 50% by 2050, including increases in coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. BASIC countries (which other identify as BRICS countries) will continue to demand enormous sums of money for slowing economic growth which the use of fossil fuels promotes. [Apparently, the leadership of these countries are not as easily bought off as once thought.] After reviewing the situation, Hawkins concludes: “Even in the fantasy land of the UN, reality rears its head. President Trump’s rejection of the ‘climate emergency’ delirium will not make him an outlier, but a leader in the continuing world-wide effort to build societies in which people can lead better lives on their own terms.” See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ****************** Weather Prediction: Meteorologist Cliff Mass argues that the US has fallen behind other countries, particular the EU, in weather predictions, despite spending a great sum of money. In his essay “Make American Weather Prediction Great Again!” Mass asks: “Why is U.S. Government Weather Prediction Lagging?” To which he responds: “The reasons are fairly clear: The U.S. numerical weather prediction effort is divided, with NOAA, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, and the Department of Energy all funding substantial efforts. Resources are sub-optimal at each agency and uncoordinated. All substantially lag the European Center in forecast skill. The capabilities of the large U.S. weather research community are not sufficiently applied by government efforts. This is particularly true of the university-based National Center for Atmospheric Research, which has developed an advanced global prediction model that is not used for global prediction by NOAA or other agencies. NOAA/NWS has grown a large inefficient bureaucracy for the management and development of numerical weather prediction. Responsibilities are divided and duplication is extensive.” To this TWTW adds: We should separate weather prediction entities from climate predictions entities. The two are incompatible and should not be under the same entity – NOAA. Let them stand alone and see how they do. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ****************** Bar Talk or Real? Project Veritas is a conservative group that uses hidden cameras to try to embarrass its subjects. It recorded a person who was under the influence of alcohol and who was described as a consultant to the EPA. That person stated that the EPA was sending billions of dollars to many small select groups to oppose the incoming Trump administration. It is not clear if these assertions are bar talk or are verifiable actions by the EPA. Certainly, the Biden administration misled many with the Inflation Reduction Act in which it allocated billions of dollars for unreliable, expensive, and unneeded wind and solar power. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy. ****************** Number of the Week: Over 7 days. Wind power in the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has a nameplate capacity of about 3,000 megawatts. For seven days, the wind generated virtually no power. For wind and solar nameplate capacity has little meaning. The BPA transmission system covers about 300,000 square miles primarily in the Pacific Northwest. Imagine the complexity of cold starting that system after 7 days of no power.

How to Preserve America’s International Leadership Role on Climate Change By Jackson Blackwell, Real Clear Energy, Dec 3, 2024 With a potential American retreat from the Paris Climate Accords looming large, it is clearer than ever: we have to make a sustained energy transition a bipartisan priority in the U.S. To do so, philanthropists must close the gap in right-of-center climate organizing and advocacy. Amazingly, less than 1% of the climate movement’s resources go toward engaging and mobilizing conservatives and Republicans on this issue.

Like Metop-B, Metop-C was designed to use fuel to maintain its orbital altitude and inclination, so (until fuel reserves are depleted) there is no diurnal drift adjustment needed. Metop-B is beginning to show some drift in the last year or so, but it’s too little at this point to worry about any diurnal drift correction. The Version 6.1 global area-averaged temperature trend (January 1979 through November 2024) remains at +0.15 deg/ C/decade (+0.21 C/decade over land, +0.13 C/decade over oceans).

Climate-Change Colonialism Keeps Poor Countries Impoverished Development agencies fund green projects when people need jobs, food and energy. By Bjorn Lomborg, WSJ, Dec. 2, 2024 TWTW Summary: The president of the Copenhagen Consensus writes: “At the latest United Nations climate summit, developing nations slammed rich countries’ pledge to spend $300 billion annually on climate reparations as ‘crumbs.’ The reality is much worse. Wealthy nations likely won’t conjure up $300 billion in new spending. Europe has been roiled by protests against radical climate policies and the 2024 U.S. election was an indictment of, among other things, aggressive climate regulations. Instead, wealthy nations will do what they’ve done before: raid development funds to the detriment of the people they claim to help. Members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development currently spend $223.7 billion a year trying to do good in poor countries through bilateral and multilateral aid and development spending. It is politically much easier for politicians intent on green spending to shift this money to climate purposes than try to get voters to go along with fresh outlays. Rich nations have diverted much of this funding to climate-change initiatives. OECD members spent one-third of their direct development aid on climate in fiscal 2021-22, the most recent year for which data are available. Development banks have twisted their purpose even further: The World Bank last year sent 44% of its lending to climate causes, the African Development Bank 55% and the European Investment Bank 60%. This charade needs to stop. As part of President-elect Trump’s reforms to wasteful government, he should return development aid to policies that make a real difference. Advocates of green aid are right that climate change will hurt poor countries, but almost every other challenge these nations face—from hunger and poverty to disease and poor education—hurts them more. Typically, climate aid is the worst way to improve quality of life or prevent deaths. Some adaptations to extreme weather are prudent. Early-warning systems for hurricanes and dikes can deliver excellent benefits for each dollar spent. But most climate aid does little to help the developing world. What feeble returns it does bring are dwarfed by the good that could have been done if governments spent that money on direct development efforts such as expanding childhood vaccines or improving crops. This is especially true for climate aid that goes toward emission cuts. The very poorest countries in the world are responsible for less than 0.5% of emissions. They don’t need decarbonization. They need growth, which requires access to copious, reliable energy. Given solar and wind power’s unreliability—and consequent reliance on expensive backup power—this will mostly have to come from fossil fuels. Denying these countries access to cheap and reliable energy is equivalent to condemning them to poverty. Perversely, multilateral development banks spend two-thirds of their climate financing—a massive $50 billion a year—on ‘mitigation’ policies, helping poor countries cut carbon emissions and pushing them only to adopt unreliable power sources. When people need jobs and food, it is immoral to give them solar panels instead. Poverty kills nearly 10 million people annually through related problems such as infectious diseases and hunger. By comparison, the climate-change toll is tiny. Extreme weather took an average of 9,000 lives each year over the past decade. There are many core development priorities wealthy nations could fund that would quickly and efficiently save lives and create economic growth. These include reducing the scourges of malaria and tuberculosis, improving learning outcomes and cutting maternal and neonatal deaths. Carbon mitigation in poorer countries, on the other hand, will generate only a minuscule temperature reduction about a century from now.” Mr. Lomborg states that “climate aid” money is lost and that actual development, not green policy, is needed in poorer nations. Why Are UK Electricity Prices So High? Or more accurately, why are UK electricity prices going up and up and up? It’s that nice Mr Miliband, the self-appointed global pied piper of the energy transition, and his coterie of 6th form lunatic advisors… “”Miliband is retaining his long-term advisers.

The ship of climate change has been on-course to disaster for 30+ well-funded and well-promoted years. During those years the growth of safe-clean-reliable and cost-efficient nuclear power has been stalled. Electricity generation from nuclear (Ember and Energy Institute) https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/nuclear-energy-generation?tab=chart&country=~OWID_WRL “The United States invariably does the right thing, after having exhausted every other alternative.” — Winston Churchillhttps://quotes.guide/winston-churchill/quote/the-united-states-invariably-does-the-right-thing-after-having-exhausted-every-other-alternative/ “Commentators such as Francis Menton have called for a demonstration project showing that a modern city or community can thrive on wind and solar plus storage.” I follow and appreciate Menton’s great insights on these technical and societal issues, but I believe that a large-scale city-wide project is unnecessary. I believe that single household will do just as well and will give the necessary results a lot quicker, or at least for a lot less cost. I would start with an existing house somewhere in Kansas, near the geographical center of the nation. The household would have to create all of its energy resources for heating, cooling, automotive (including vacations), and electrical needs, ON ITS OWN PROPERTY. I would allow purchase of BEV charging while on vacations. On-property storage of on-site generated electrical energy would be required for all energy needs. This would require a house with quite a bit of property to safely place all of the wind, solar, and battery or other storage requirements. No grid connection would be allowed. Any depletion of storage would be considered a failure of the project and require a reset of the project start time. I submit that the ability of the project to run a full year, from noon June 21 to noon June 21 of the next year would constitute project success, and then the cost of the project would be scaled up to project the expected cost for the entire nation. At each interim project failure (running out of storage or equipment breakdown), the entire costs to the date of the failure would also be projected as a “more than” cost for the entire nation. I contend that the project will never succeed before the projected costs will exceed even what the most Liberal blue state governance would accept (though, I expect that at least several would attempt to ignore the results). ‘I would start with an existing house somewhere in Kansas, near the geographical center of the nation. The household would have to create all of its energy resources for heating, cooling, automotive (including vacations), and electrical needs, ON ITS OWN PROPERTY.’ Except for the reference to automobiles and electricity, it sounds a lot like “Little House on the Prairie”. But that’s the Left’s objective isn’t it? Absolute power for themselves, liquidation of their opponents and a 19th century subsistence existence for the remaining masses. I’d bet against you on this one. My 2400 square foot cabin easily gets by on 18 m^2 solar panels and a bank of lead acid deep cells. I use maybe 50 gallons of propane for hot water and the stove. Wood for heating – I’ve 5 acres and get plenty of wood from it. I don’t live there even half time, but the systems are barely breaking a sweat. There are lots of off grid homes is what I’m saying. It is generally agreed that the lapse rate and the greenhouse effect are directly tied to each other. Water can change both the slope and the Y intercept of the lapse rate. CO2 can only change the intercept. Kininmonth … asserts that oceans warm the atmosphere as opposed to the atmosphere warms the oceans as claimed by many global warming advocates. There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that when it comes to polar and tropical mesoscale cyclones, that they draw their energy from the ocean surface through latent heat predominantly in the tropics as opposed to sensible heat in the polar regions. Although I haven’t studies midlatitutes in depth, I can believe the mechanisms are more complex there.

Title: Computer science grads say the job market is rough. Some are opting for a 'panic' master's degree instead.

A computer science degree has become an increasingly popular choice for students seeking a six-figure job in Big Tech out of college. However, as the tech industry took a sharp turn from pandemic hiring sprees to more recent mass layoffs, conversations with over a dozen CS majors revealed many are struggling to find full-time roles and internships despite sending out hundreds of applications. Now, some are opting for a "panic master's" instead, delaying their search by getting a graduate degree in the hopes the job market will improve in a year or two. Samhita Parvatini, who graduated from Penn State University in May, told Business Insider that she entered college during the hiring frenzies of 2021 when computer science degrees were "highly sought out." "Every industry needed engineers," she said. "Everybody said, 'Oh, it's one of the most valuable degrees you can get. You can earn so much money, you get a lot of success and career growth.'" After sending out 250 to 300 applications since graduating, with little success, Parvatini said the Big Tech landscape felt like it was "becoming the opposite" of what it was five years ago. Software developer employment largely declined between late 2019 and early 2024, according to data from ADP Research Institute, with some spikes in the second half of 2021 and winter 2022 amid the pandemic hiring spree. Data from Indeed indicated job postings in the software development sector have largely dropped back to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, videos showing swarms of candidates at job fairs have become increasingly common on social media. Yahya Bashir, a recent CS graduate from Gustavus Adolphus College, said that his job-hunting experience in the past year has become more arduous. During his last application cycle in summer 2023, Bashir said he often heard back quickly from companies and was invited to several interviews. However, the majority of the roles he applied to this year, which he estimates to be about a hundred, didn't reply. "Most of them, you don't even hear back from them," Bashir said. "You submit your application, and there's just nothing." Facing low response rates and, in some cases, "ghost job" postings, software engineers fresh out of school are also having to compete with their more experienced peers. With companies continuing to trim their staffs, the tech sector has also faced two years of brutal layoffs. In 2022, over 165,000 employees were cut from 1,000 tech companies, per Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks tech layoffs. In 2023, the number of layoffs increased to over 264,000. So far in 2024, nearly 150,000 employees have been cut from over 520 tech companies. With hundreds of thousands of already established tech workers cut loose into the job market, new graduates are facing increased competition for fewer openings. Emos Ker, a recent graduate from New York University, said that although sub-industries within computer science, like AI and LLM, are booming as Big Tech invests heavily, these fields often require a higher level of training. Although more universities like Carnegie Mellon and Columbia University are starting to offer AI degrees and programs, Ker said that many institutions are not yet able to provide the specific education needed for more specialized fields like AI. Looking through a stack of résumés, companies may choose to hire a seasoned Big Tech veteran over a CS graduate who would likely require more guidance. "With all the tech firings, they're looking for people who are like midlevel, senior engineers," Ker said. "And unfortunately, for people like us who want to come out and work in AI, it's not really easy to get into because you kind of need to train us from the ground up." Instead of risking being hung out to dry in the job market, several recent computer science graduates told BI that they or their peers have opted to return to the classroom to delay the search. "The funny thing is, when I started my undergrad, I was very stubborn and was like, 'Oh, I don't need a master's,'" Parvatini said. "'It's a CS degree, you know, it's so valuable." A month out from graduation and without a job lined up, Parvatini said she applied for a master's degree program as a "last-minute decision." "I knew that I wasn't going to go anywhere after graduation," she said. "So I thought, might as well apply, and we'll take a couple of classes, you know, do something better with my time during this period." Professor David Garlan, the associate dean for Carnegie Mellon's computer science master's program, said that while the university hasn't seen a notable increase in CS grad enrollment, other schools with less selective and extensive programs may experience otherwise. "It's definitely true that when the economy has a downturn, people go back to education because they're not able to find jobs so quickly," he said. "So there is definitely that trend, overall." Enrollment in MIT's EECS Master of Engineering program increased from 241 students for the 2023-2024 academic year to 303 this academic year — a spike compared to previous years when enrollment stayed relatively consistent in the mid-200s. A report by the Council of Graduate Schools said that computer science was the "only field to increase in first-time enrollment (5.4%) between Fall 2021 and Fall 2022." Ian Hurrel, who is finishing his last semester at Georgia Institute of Technology, said he enrolled in the university's one-year master's program largely because the job market was getting worse. "A lot of people, including me, wanted to stay in college one more year to get an internship," Hurrel said. "It was very much a 'panic master's' sort of thing." Although computer and information sciences often have lower graduate enrollment compared to other fields, a report by Burning Glass Institute indicated that 7% of those who earned graduate degrees in CS remained unemployed. While costly, the additional schooling could buy students time, bolster their résumés, and ultimately lead to better-paying jobs. Data from PayScale published last year found that employees with a Master of Science degree made an average base salary of $112,000, compared to $72,000 for those with a bachelor's degree in computer science. Despite lower morale among some CS majors, others believe that finding employment in the tech sector is not as dire as many people on social media portray it. Sydney Bishop, a senior at UC Irvine, said despite being unable to land an internship this past summer after sending over 180 applications, she remained optimistic about the job market. "I haven't lost faith that I'll get a job somewhere," Bishop said. "It just might not be a cushy tech job that all of us have been raised to think about." While tech giants like Google and Microsoft may not be handing out as many opportunities as they did during their hiring peaks, Bishop said that the technical skills of programming are still — and will continue to be — needed within companies. Hurrel, who was able to land an internship with Amazon this past summer, said that he disagrees with the "fear-mongering" from people online saying computer science is a dying degree. "I don't think it's oversaturated to the point where it will become extremely devalued and not be a worthwhile career anymore," he said. "I think it's just going to be harder than it was at the peak to break into it." Hurrel added that there are "clearly still jobs" and that several of his peers have also been able to land internships and full-time roles. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that by 2033, employment of software developers will increase by 18%. Samuel Onabolu is one of these newly minted engineers. After sending out over 1,000 applications, he said he was finally able to land a full-time software engineering role four months after graduating from Brock University in May. "I'm kind of surprised I even got a job so early because there are 2023 grads, 2022 grads that are still looking," he said. "So I would say it's just a lot about perseverance and a little bit of luck." Onabolu said that while he had been "feeling really depressed" during his unsuccessful job search, he advised other new and incoming grads to prioritize internships and networking events to try to get their foot in the door. "I feel like every CS major is going through the exact process I went through," he said. "I feel like it just takes that one acceptance, that one offer, to kind of break into that career." Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Bitcoin just dropped below $100K for the fifth time this week. Those sell orders aren't slowing down. While Bitcoin is stumbling, something interesting is happening with Ethereum. See, the market's been so focused on Bitcoin's six-figure dream that most people missed what's happening on Ethereum's charts. The patterns? They're starting to look eerily similar to the ones we saw right before 2021's massive run. Ethereum needs a 24% weekly gain to hit its all-time high. Usually, that would sound ambitious. But with BlackRock injecting $500M into ETH holdings and institutional money flowing in, the numbers are starting to make sense. Even the analysts who've been bearish since 2022 are changing their tune. They're talking about "structural changes" and sustainable growth - words they don't throw around lightly. The really interesting part? The resistance levels between here and the all-time high are surprisingly thin. It's like someone cleared the path while we weren't looking. So what's actually going on in the crypto markets right now? Let me break down today's biggest stories... PEPE coin flips Uniswap with an $11B market cap. So what's pumping its price so high? 🤔 Alt season signals are flashing - HBAR +99%, IOTA +79%, JASMY +72%. But what concerning signals is the perpetual futures market showing? 📊 Ethereum ETFs hit a 10-day winning streak. What's sparking such a huge interest in it now? 💫 Bitcoin keeps bouncing off $100K like it's made of rubber. Here’s what's causing this rigid resistance! 🔍 Trump's David Sacks steps in to battle "Operation Choke Point 2.0" as Coinbase shares evidence. What are they? ⚖️ Let’s dive in! PEPE just accomplished something that seemed impossible a few months ago - it jumped over Uniswap in market value. Pepe coin, which started as yet another meme token in 2023, now sits at an $11 billion market cap. That's bigger than Uniswap's UNI token, one of DeFi's cornerstone projects. The surge isn't just a short-term spike either. Since January, Pepe's value has multiplied 18 times, turning what many dismissed as a joke into a serious market player. So what’s pumping its price so high? Read the full story! The alts market is painting an interesting picture right now. Some tokens are going absolutely wild - Hedera jumped 99%, IOTA climbed 79%, and JasmyCoin shot up 72% since November. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's grip on the market is loosening. Its dominance dropped below 55% for the first time in months, sparking debates about whether we're entering the alt-season territory. But there's a problem. The perpetual futures market is showing some concerning signals. What are they? Read the full story! Ethereum ETFs just hit a milestone - 10 straight days of money flowing in, pushing the weekly total to a staggering $836.7 million. Fidelity is leading the charge, with their Ethereum Fund pulling in $47.9 million in a single day. The total trading volume is hitting record after record, approaching $1 billion daily. The timing couldn't be more perfect. Ethereum just broke past $4,000, hitting levels we haven't seen since March. And it's not just the price - the NFT market is showing signs of life again, with top projects posting double-digit gains. But remember when analysts were calling ETH ETF a gigantic failure just a few months ago? What’s sparking such a huge interest in it now? Read the full story! Bitcoin crossed 100K again, only to fall back to 99K (again). Back in 2011, you could buy a Bitcoin for just $1. Two years later, it hit $1,000, and people thought that was crazy. Now? We're talking about six figures. So what’s causing this rigid resistance? Read the full story! David Sacks, Trump's new AI and Crypto Czar, is stepping into a battle that's been brewing beneath the surface of crypto regulations - the mysterious "Operation Choke Point 2.0." The story starts with Silvergate Bank's collapse. Chris Lane, their former CTO, stated that the bank was perfectly solvent after FTX's fall, but regulators systematically cut off their ability to serve crypto clients until they had no choice but to shut down. Now Coinbase has entered the chat with some explosive evidence. What are they? Read the full story! Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Life after Google: 8 laid-off employees reflect on being let go, what they did next, and their advice for others

Time Published: 2024-12-09T09:01:02Z

After you're laid off, what comes next? For many tech workers, there's no easy answer. Following historic mass layoffs in 2023 and 2024, tech hiring has slowed and the job market looks increasingly bleak. Laid-off employees face an uncertain future. For a road map on how to move on post-layoff, we spoke to former employees at Google, which cut 6% of its workforce nearly two years ago and has continued making cuts in 2024. Eight ex-Googlers impacted by those layoffs — including one who has since returned to the company — shared what it was like to lose what some considered their "dream job," how they found their footing in the aftermath, and their advice for others facing similar circumstances. Many of the employees Business Insider spoke with said they were caught off guard by their layoff or that they expected only low performers to be impacted. Google said it provided impacted employees with outplacement support and invited them to apply for open roles across the company. Some interviewees told BI they found few openings. Since their layoffs, these former Googlers' paths have varied. One ran for city council; another took a job at Trader Joe's. Some landed jobs at other Big Tech companies, and others launched their own ventures. While many reflected fondly on their time at Google and felt their layoff was a blessing in disguise, others expressed frustration toward Google's leadership. Here are their stories, in their own words. Their quotes have been edited for length and clarity. Gordon is a lawyer by trade who worked at Meta prior to joining Google as a privacy program manager eight months before the 2023 layoffs. I was at a coffee shop with my husband when a news alert popped up on his phone saying that Google was laying off 12,000 people that day. We'd both survived layoffs before — my husband works at Amazon and I'd been at Facebook prior to Google — so layoff news generally didn't startle us; we were used to it. I'm sure it's not me, I thought. But then I tried to log into my computer, and my password was rejected. I very quickly recognized the silver lining of the opportunity. I had six months' severance. I'd never taken a break before — I'd been working like crazy since graduating from law school in 2012. I rested and spent more time with my kids. We took a family vacation. I started doing Pilates and got back into therapy. I used the time as a true sabbatical to reenergize myself for the next phase of my career. After three months, I started applying for jobs. I turned down an offer from a consulting firm because that world didn't feel like the right fit for me. Some big law firms approached me, and I took a contract role at a firm while continuing my job search. I started a new role in data privacy at Cruise, a self-driving car company, the same week my Google severance ended, but a few months later I was laid off again. I dove right back into the job search and have been at Amazon since December. So far, everything is good. People are very nice and welcoming here, and I love my team. I'm eight months pregnant and plan to take maternity leave, but I'll be back to work after that. I also launched a coaching business recently and will be producing a new podcast next year. I have peace around how everything ended up. My advice to people is that if you are going into tech right now, you can't be someone who takes yourself extremely seriously. I have a huge sense of humor, and that gets me through a lot of things. Because my husband and I both work in tech, people assume that we must live large, but we don't. We share a Toyota and live with the knowledge that we are very fortunate to be in jobs we love, but it could all be gone tomorrow. Kim led Google's communications team in Korea for 12 years before moving to its Mountain View headquarters in 2019 to establish its international media team. She was the director of global communications prior to her 2023 layoff. As a longtime Googler who'd been with the company through the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, I felt like I was safe. At first, I thought the layoff email I received was a scam. As reality began to set in, I got really angry; I'd been so loyal to Google. I loved working there and felt so proud to be there. I went through the five stages of grief and wondered, Why me? I got depressed. I'd look at my empty calendar and feel rejected, like nobody wanted me. I began to see how I could use my severance package as an opportunity. I decided to do a "gap year" and wrote out a list of things I'd always wanted to do: work at Trader Joe's, be a barista, work at In-N-Out Burger, drive for Lyft or Uber, pet sit, work as a bartender. It made me feel really rejuvenated. That first weekend, I applied to Trader Joe's. But on my first day, I had trouble walking in the door. I'd been the director at a big company, was a two-time published author, and had been featured on a top Korean talk show; I thought people would look down on me because of the Asian cultural concept of "saving face." It was an internal barrier I had to break through, and I did. By May, I was working three jobs at the same time for up to 70 hours a week — Trader Joe's, Starbucks, and Lyft whenever I had time — plus pet-sitting on an ad hoc basis. I decided to write a book about my experience to motivate other people in the same situation as me. Being laid off is painful — even more so in Korean culture because people don't talk about it. I wanted to be an example and say, "It's not your fault, and you can make full use of your time and then move on." After 18 months, I ended up moving back to Korea to be the chief brand officer at Hanmi Group, a pharmaceutical company. Things have changed a lot in the five years I was away, but I'm using my experience from 30 years in international companies and learning a lot from local companies. I've also found my customer support and marketing experience at Trader Joe's and Starbucks to be helpful. I hope to retire in the US. Trader Joe's has a really good internal transfer system, so I'd love to work for two years in San Francisco, then in Idaho, then in Florida, and so on, so that I can explore the States while making money. I miss a lot about Google, but more about the early days when it felt like a family. The company grew and grew, and we had to lose some parts and focus on efficiency. I did a good job of quickly processing and moving on after my layoff. In hindsight, I wonder why I didn't take a break to travel, but I know I would've been too worried to enjoy it. If I were to share advice with friends going through the same thing, I'd tell them not to feel too anxious, especially about things they can't control. Maybe the future is already ready, even though you don't know it. A senior software engineer who was laid off in January 2024 secured another job at Google a few weeks later. They asked to be kept anonymous to protect their job security. I was really happy at Google. For the most part, I think it strikes the right balance between productivity and work-life balance. I had to take medical leave for depression at another fast-paced Big Tech job I'd worked; at another job, things felt like they moved at a glacial pace. At Google, I didn't feel overwhelmed, yet also felt like I was delivering. It was definitely my favorite place I've worked. Because of my history of depression, I was afraid that I'd go to suicidality if I was laid off, so I worked with my counselor to set up a well-defined game plan. When the layoff actually happened, it felt horrible — my worst fear coming true. If I were early in my career or if my child and wife didn't depend on me as the breadwinner, I probably would've thought, Nice! Good vacation and generous severance. But I was super anxious about what might happen if I didn't find a comparable job in the next four or five months before our cost of living exceeded the severance. I had my résumé already prepped and a contact list of people to reach out to immediately, and I went into cortisol-fueled search mode. I reached out to a lot of connections for referrals and applied everywhere, both internally and externally. I checked the Google internal job posting site every day, but there weren't many open positions. I also applied to every relevant LinkedIn EasyApply position. I spent the rest of my time practicing LeetCode problems and reviewing past projects. A few weeks later I got a response from one of my Google applications and set up a video call. A couple of days later, the manager told me they wanted to bring me on. My biggest priority was securing a job so I accepted, despite having advanced in the interview process at some other companies. The Google role also had some advantages, like maintaining my competitive compensation and giving me an opportunity to develop relevant skills and future-proof my qualifications. Returning to Google, I feel more anxious and find it harder to focus. Before the layoffs, I had a sense of security, like I was in a really good industry that paid well and had lots of mobility. Now, I have this ever-present fear that the industry will shrink and become too competitive, or companies will choose to take efficiency gains from AI to cut costs. And I've lost trust in Google's leadership. The real responsibility for layoffs lies with upper middle management up to leadership, and I feel there's been essentially no accountability. Still, I think coming back to Google was the best risk-averse decision. My plan worked well, and I think I went about things the best I could. Duran worked at Google for almost nine years in various roles, including as the first chief of staff to the VP of operations. She also headed YouTube Mexico during the pandemic. Prior to the 2023 layoff, she was the head of strategy and operations for YouTube's Latin American and Canadian markets. The night before the layoff, I missed dinner with my family to take a strategy call with the creator marketing team based in Singapore. The next morning, I tried to check my work calendar before breakfast and it wouldn't load. People had been nervous about layoffs but thought low performers would be the only ones impacted. That's not what happened. Once I realized my role had been eliminated, I started bawling. I'd given everything to the company, like so many of us, and it wasn't a possibility in my head that I would be laid off. I gave myself the weekend to grieve. One of my best friends visited from Seattle to support me. Three days later, I started a podcast, an idea I'd been playing with for a while. I put my head down and worked on it as if it was a full-time job; I loved it. It was therapeutic. I talked a lot with guests about childhood circumstances and how they influence our careers and decision-making. I came from a working-class background, and after getting an Ivy League education, I saw how easy it was to get sucked into thinking, I can't take this other kind of job because what is it going to say about me? I was fortunate that I had enough severance that it took me pretty much through the end of the year. I became more active on LinkedIn and told people I was looking for a job; before, I'd been a very private person who didn't like asking for help. A friend of a friend, despite not really knowing me, helped pass my résumé on to different leaders at Intuit. I had an informational call with one, and when an opportunity arose within his team, I was able to land the job. I've been really happy here — my manager is really supportive, and we're working on tough, interesting problems. After working at Google for so long and seeing how it ended, I've been thinking about how I spend my time. Even though I love my job now, I haven't let it interfere with my other priorities, like carving out dedicated time for my two kids. I'm also still regularly publishing podcast episodes, and I recently joined a nonprofit board. There were a couple of times when I considered leaving Google but didn't because of fear. My advice for people is to not make career decisions from a place of fear. Stay somewhere because you're passionate, not because you're afraid to try something else. I don't regret that night before I was laid off when I missed dinner with my family to work; I was excited about the project and was trying to be mindful of people in other time zones. But now I know that my layoff decision had already been made at that point, and the company was comfortable having me work really late the night before they were going to lay me off. My advice to people is to make sure that when you're making these trade-offs, you're doing it with clear eyes. Neyer interned at Google during college and returned seven years later as a developer relations engineer, before being laid off in January 2023. When I found out I was laid off, I felt almost a relief and a sense of openness. I suddenly had this blessing of a healthy severance to use to build what I wanted outside of Google. I intermittently job-searched for a few months and almost joined an early-stage startup, but nothing quite landed. I also traveled a bit around the US, did a lot of reading and writing, and participated in a lot of community engagement. I have a thriving community here in Boulder and enjoy being in nature. I also became the executive director of a nonprofit I joined in 2022 called Consciousness Hacking Colorado — now relaunched as Woven Web — focused on facilitating harmony between technology, society, consciousness, and nature. I've begun a second master's degree, this time in creative technology and design at the University of Colorado Boulder's Atlas Institute. I also ran for Boulder City Council. I didn't win, but the city council appointed me to the Human Relations Commission which has been great. We're working on issues of how to address tensions in our community, especially in relation to the Middle East conflict, and how we can bring about better dialogue to address these tensions. I bike past the Google office a lot here in Boulder and often feel a tenderness in my heart. For all of the company's faults, there are many things that it does well, like the beautiful community of people who work there. I don't have too many regrets in life. There are so many pathways, but the one that I'm on feels really beautiful. I'll go back into some form of full-time work at some point, but I'm not rushing to any decisions. For now, I feel stable enough to keep prioritizing learning and creating community, putting a lot of the gifts I received at Google to good use. Eric Wages worked at Google for 15 years in various roles and spent over a decade leading its third-largest data center campus. Before his 2023 layoff, he was the global program manager of the corporate real estate team. I wasn't surprised by the layoff. I could see the tide turning a year in advance; people weren't working in the office, and yet we had many billions of dollars of office construction ongoing. I spent a lot of effort trying to convince leadership to pause construction, but my attempts weren't well-received. I'd been laid off before and knew that layoffs aren't personal. Still, I went through the traditional stages of grief. I'm someone who has to live with a purpose, and my purpose evaporated when I received an impersonal layoff email that Friday morning. I bought a whiteboard, put it behind my desk, and started trying to figure out what my purpose was now: What am I good at? Do I want to ever work for a large company again? I knew I never wanted to work with jerks again — I'm not saying I worked for many of them at Google, but there are many folks who are just a pain. I wanted the flexibility to work with people I enjoyed working with and help them solve problems — that's what I had always enjoyed as a leader. Three months later, I started my own firm, Idealem Solutions Group. It's a mix of technical consulting, coaching, and understanding how people work, focused on data centers. I'm thankful for the layoff, because I'd been in the golden handcuffs. I think I'd be miserable if I were still there today. And as much as I bemoan the golden handcuffs, they've served me well. My 15 years at Google set me up with a wonderful financial backstop, which has allowed me to be picky about how I work and what I charge. Being an independent consultant and business owner is rewarding. When I couldn't find a contractor this summer to fix some things around the house, I was able to not actively seek new clients for a couple of months and just do it myself. It also allowes me to have a better relationship with my wife. While I think Google could have done better with the layoff, there's no good way to lay off 12,000 people. Any manager who's had to terminate someone knows to expect the absolute worst. Multiply that by 12,000 — locking the doors and turning off the badge was, dare I say it, the best way. But one way they could've done better was to ask for volunteers; I would've strongly considered leaving if an offer had been tendered. It was extremely frustrating to see the culture changing after being there for so long. Chen joined Google in 2016 as an account manager for the company's Singapore advertisers and did a three-month rotation with Google's strategy and operations team in Silicon Valley in 2019. Prior to the 2024 layoffs, he was the head of small business ad sales for the Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan markets. My last day at Google — my dream job — was on Valentine's Day this year, the day before my 38th birthday. Logically, I knew that industry ups and downs and turnover were pretty normal. Emotionally, though, it was tough. I had been there eight years; that's like an eight-year relationship. My initial reaction was pain and anger, driven by ego. I also compared myself to those who weren't laid off, feeling like I was better or more experienced or more loyal than they were. I had a lot of sleepless nights and went through the grieving process. My wife was extremely supportive. The toughest part was knowing that the next day, the company just moved on. That was sort of a rude awakening. I was given two months to look for other roles internally. I panicked and applied for every job available, hanging on for dear life to the possibility of still being able to call myself a Googler — a huge part of my identity. A couple of senior Google leaders graciously reached out about joining their teams, but I knew I wouldn't enjoy the roles and didn't want to do a bad job. When I turned them down, every part of my body was shaking. I splurged on a solo snowboarding trip to Japan and spent time alone in the mountains. I'd wake up at night crying. There had been so much going on that once I gave my body and mind a bit of peace and space, it automatically went into recovery mode, which was very therapeutic. I posted my first YouTube video in April. I wanted to share my layoff story to bring comfort and courage to others. Many people reached out to me saying things like, "I felt the same way," and "Even my therapist couldn't articulate how I'm feeling as well as you did." It feels like my calling is to help people have a healthier relationship with their careers and money, and my YouTube channel has grown since then. I've also launched a coaching and consulting business and teach at the National University of Singapore. While I don't earn as much as I did working full-time, I make more per hour and have much more flexibility. I also achieved financial freedom several years ago, by growing my income from $80,000 to close to $300,000 at Google, saving and investing at least half of my paycheck, and being very conscious of my spending. I wish I'd been more supportive of people that I used to work with who were laid off before me. While Google was and still is a huge part of my identity, I learned that there are really other parts of my life that I should nurture. Looking back, I'm grateful — I wouldn't have discovered this life was possible if not for the layoff. Ferraz started in sales at Google in São Paolo, Brazil, in 2011 after college, briefly left for another opportunity, and returned as an analytical lead in Google's San Francisco office. Prior to the 2023 layoffs, she was a senior product manager in Google's internal incubator, Area 120. When I woke up that morning and saw the layoff email, I was so out of touch with reality that my first concern was that my team wouldn't be able to access a document I'd been up late working on the night before. It took a bit of time for me to realize, "Wait, I lost my job." I jumped straight into practical things. A friend and former coworker who'd read about the layoffs told me she was hiring, so I jumped out of bed and did an interview, but I could hardly pay attention. I went back to Brazil for a week to be close to my childhood friends. For those of us in tech, it felt like the world was falling apart, but I'm from an island in the south of Brazil, and being there helped me keep that in perspective. I ended up moving to Miami, where a lot of my friends had moved during the pandemic. Climate tech is one of my personal passions, and I took a remote consulting job with a nonprofit biodiversity lab based in Zurich for a few months. On one of my trips to Zurich, I met my now-cofounder. Looking for a cofounder in the months prior was almost like dating — finding the right one was the most challenging part, and now that I have, it feels so right. Together, we incorporated biodiversityX, an AI-powered tech company providing real-time forest analytics, in Zurich. Losing a job is traumatic, but it's humbling to think about how much Google transformed my life. It was such a good place to grow and develop as a leader, and I miss the culture, the food, and the people. Before, I thought a career had to be very linear — one promotion after another; tomorrow needs to be bigger than yesterday. Today, I see things as a bit more fluid and view the layoff as a blessing in disguise. Being an entrepreneur — the degree of responsibility and the speed at which we can move — is so freeing and rewarding. The pieces are coming together, and I'm grateful to Google for being such a great school. Jump to

Title: US private credit firm Golub Capital to set up base in Abu Dhabi

By Federico Maccioni ABU DHABI (Reuters) -U.S.-listed direct lender and private credit manager Golub Capital is opening an office in the UAE's capital Abu Dhabi, it said on Monday, joining dozens of other firms looking to grow their business in the region and deepen ties with its wealth funds. Golub, which had more than $70 billion of capital under management as of Oct. 1, has received preliminary approval for a licence to operate out of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), the emirate's financial centre, it said in a statement, adding that it had also appointed Naser Almutairi as managing director for the Middle East. "We've had clients in the region for over a decade...We are eager to expand our business and to expand our client service," CEO Lawrence Golub told Reuters in an interview. He said the office is expected to open in January but declined to say how many staff it would have. The presence of sovereign wealth funds, an attractive regulatory environment and an increasing number of high net worth individuals were among the factors influencing the decision, he said. The announcement came as global and regional financiers gathered in the UAE's capital city for the first day of the Abu Dhabi Finance Week annual conference. The emirate, which holds 90% of the UAE's oil reserves, has accelerated efforts to diversify its economy with ADGM striving to become a global hub. Although it trails neighbouring Dubai's DIFC financial centre, ADGM's assets under management reached $157.2 billion by the end of June with firms including the family office of billionaire Ray Dalio and hedge fund Brevan Howard. It is also attracting firms active in private credit, an asset class expected to grow to $2.6 trillion by 2029 from $1.5 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Preqin data, as stricter regulations make it more expensive for traditional lenders to finance riskier loans. Golub, which focuses on middle and upper middle market companies, is planning further investment activities in the Middle East, the CEO said, adding that it was "very seriously" considering applying for a licence in Saudi Arabia, where it saw "big potential", although this would not happen next year.

The asset class is expected to grow to $2.6 trillion by 2029 from $1.5 trillion at the end of last year, according to Preqin data. BlackRock said last week that it would invest about $12 billion to buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners. Gulf sovereign wealth funds are also expanding in the private credit space, including Abu Dhabi's $330 billion Mubadala, which has forged partnerships with the likes of Apollo and Goldman Sachs in recent years and last week said it would buy a 42% stake in U.S. credit asset manager Silver Rock Financial.

Title: Will Amazon Buy Bitcoin? Shareholders Propose 5% Investment

Time Published: 2024-12-09T07:00:02Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have submitted a proposal urging the $2.3 trillion technology conglomerate to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. The measure, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research and slated for discussion at Amazon’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting in April, calls on the company’s Board to assess whether incorporating BTC as a treasury asset would serve the best long-term interests of shareholders. In the proposal, shareholders stress that Amazon’s current treasury management may be insufficient in the face of ongoing inflation. As stated in the submission: “Corporations that invest their assets wisely can – and often do – increase shareholder value more than more profitable businesses that don’t.” According to the supporting materials, Amazon’s current treasury includes approximately $88 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, out of a total $585 billion in assets (as of September 30, 2024). The proposal’s authors argue that inflationary pressures and sub-inflationary bond yields are eroding the purchasing power of these holdings. They cite a US Consumer Price Index (CPI) average annual rate of 4.95% over the past four years, at times peaking at 9.1%, while suggesting that “in reality, the true inflation rate is significantly higher.” Against this backdrop, the submission suggests that Amazon has a “fiduciary duty” to consider inflation-resistant assets. The shareholders point to Bitcoin’s historical returns to bolster their case. They note that as of December 6, 2024, BTC price rose 131% over the previous year, outperforming corporate bonds “by 126% on average.” Over a five-year horizon, Bitcoin’s price increased by 1,246%, surpassing corporate bond returns by an estimated 1,242% during that period. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term,” the proposal states. The document also references other publicly listed firms that hold BTC. MicroStrategy, one of the earliest corporate adopters, saw its stock outperform Amazon’s by 537% over the previous year, according to the proposal. In addition, institutional players such as BlackRock and Fidelity—both of which hold significant stakes in Amazon—have introduced Bitcoin-focused investment products for their clients. The shareholders further suggest that U.S. government policy could shift toward a “Bitcoin strategic reserve” by 2025, possibly signaling broader mainstream acceptance. “Shareholders request that the Board conduct an assessment to determine if adding Bitcoin to the Company’s treasury is in the best long-term interests of shareholders,” the proposal concludes. This push at Amazon comes on the heels of a similar initiative at Microsoft. As reported by Bitcoinist, Microsoft (MSF) shareholders are set to vote on December 10 on a proposal to include Bitcoin in its treasury as a reserve asset. However, analysts note that the chances of approval are low after the Microsoft Board recommended a “no” vote. At press time, BTC traded at $99,136. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

That’s according to Sean Dawson, head of research at DeFi derivatives protocol Derive. “We continue to see a 10.5% probability of Ethereum reaching $6,000 and a 6% likelihood for Bitcoin surpassing $150,000 by January 31,” Dawson told Decrypt. “Regarding the 25 delta skews, they've remained stable since last week, showing no significant shifts, Dawson added. “It appears the market has consolidated its position over the weekend.” The 25 delta skew measures the market's bias between calls and puts, and its stability suggests traders' expectations for price direction or risk haven't shifted significantly. It follows Bitcoin’s run above its $100,000 price tag on Wednesday and the significant volatility that followed 12 hours later, which saw the asset dip to an eight-day low of $92,000. Bitcoin’s price has since regained ground, remaining flat on the day at $99,260, CoinGecko data shows. “The weekend usually results in quieter markets and subdued price movements, Dawson explained. Pointing to factors including MicroStrategy flows and BlackRock IBIT options having an outsized impact on Bitcoin’s pricing, Dawson said weekend trading “tends to reduce volatility,” giving the market a “chance to stabilize.” Bitcoin has recaptured the imagination of retail and institutional investors after President-elect Donald Trump clinched a decisive victory in the 2024 elections, held last month. Trump has promised to implement a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S. while protecting the interests of domestic crypto mining firms and those offering industry-related services. Meanwhile, exchange-traded fund flows for major issuers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, continue to post impressive records, with the former rising to become the world’s fastest fund to reach the $50 billion assets under management. “With the market in unchartered territory, we are now in a new price discovery zone,” Singapore-based QCP Capital wrote in a note on Wednesday. “We have returned to a binary scenario, where the spot price could either be driven higher, or selling pressure could push it back below $100,000.

Title: Amazon shareholders urge company to allocate at least 5% of its assets to Bitcoin

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article A group of Amazon shareholders is pushing for the company to allocate a minimum of 5% of its assets to Bitcoin, through a proposal submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a free-market principles advocacy think tank. Source: @TimKotzman The proposal, shared by Tim Kotzman, recommends Bitcoin addition to Amazon’s treasury as a hedge against inflation and asset diversification strategy. It cites Bitcoin’s superior performance compared to traditional assets like corporate bonds, while pointing to existing Bitcoin investments by companies such as MicroStrategy and Tesla. “MicroStrategy, which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet, has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. And they’re not alone. Institutional and corporate Bitcoin adoption is becoming more commonplace: more public companies such as Tesla and Block have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders—BlackRock and Fidelity, respectively—offer their clients a Bitcoin ETF, and the US government may form a Bitcoin strategic reserve in 2025,” the letter wrote. The proposal calls for Amazon’s board to evaluate whether Bitcoin treasury allocation serves shareholders’ long-term interests. Amazon has not issued a public response to the proposal, though the company has previously demonstrated interest in blockchain technology, particularly in supply chain management. The NCPPR’s proposal is part of a broad institutional push toward Bitcoin adoption. In October, the think tank sent a similar letter to Microsoft urging Bitcoin investment consideration. Microsoft’s board has advised shareholders to vote against their proposal, stating they already consider “a wide range of investable assets,” including Bitcoin. If Microsoft opts against Bitcoin investments and the digital asset’s value subsequently increases, the NCPPR warns it may end up in shareholder litigation. Microsoft shareholders are set to vote on their Bitcoin consideration proposal on December 10. Once a shareholder proposal is filed, Amazon’s board of directors will review it and decide whether to include it in Amazon’s proxy statement for the upcoming annual shareholders meeting. If the proposal is added to the proxy statement, shareholders will vote on it at the annual meeting, scheduled for April 2025. The outcome of the vote will depend on the number of votes in favor of and against the proposal. Similar to Microsoft, the Amazon board of directors typically provides a recommendation on how shareholders should vote regarding each proposal. Top Amazon shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, Fidelity Management & Research, Geode Capital Management, and JPMorgan.

Title: AI Adoption Still in ‘Very Early’ Stages, BlackRock Exec Says

Investment giant BlackRock expects 2025 to be a big year for infrastructure and cybersecurity. And the artificial intelligence (AI) boom will play a major role in those investments, Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, told CNBC in a report published Saturday (Dec. 7). “It’s still very early in the AI adoption cycle,” he said. He added that AI firms need to build out their data centers, while protecting that data will likely be a wise investment in the new year. “If you think about your data, you want to spend more on cybersecurity as it gets more valuable,” he said. “We think this is really going to benefit the cybersecurity [and the] software community, which is seeing very rapid revenue growth based off of this AI.” In addition, Jacobs sees a broader impact when it comes to the infrastructure that supports AI. As “magical” as the tech might be, it’s important to remember the physical things — power, chips, real estate — that support it. “It’s not just something that lives in the ether, in the cloud, there’s real physical things that have to happen, and that means energy, that means more materials like copper, that means more real estate. You really have to think about kind of the physical infrastructure that underlies it.” And as PYMNTS wrote last week, this is a costly infrastructure, as running advanced programs requires massive data centers and specialized processors. For example, Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI required building several AI supercomputers, each powered by thousands of Nvidia A100 GPUs. These installations eat up significant amounts of power, as training a large language model (LLM) can use the same amount of energy as thousands of households. “This pressure has sparked innovation in software architecture,” that report said. “Google has pioneered various optimization techniques, such as quantization, which reduces the precision of numbers required in calculations while maintaining model performance. Meta achieved efficiency gains with its Llama AI models through architectural improvements, allowing smaller models to perform strongly while using fewer parameters.” With this in mind, PYMNTS wrote, major tech companies are racing to shrink their AI systems, marking a major shift in the industry. “The process, known as AI optimization, involves refining complex software systems to improve their performance while reducing the computing power they need to run,” PYMNTS wrote. “These efficiency improvements can transform challenging economics into sustainable operations for companies that rely on massive computing systems.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped nearly 3% in its final hour of trade, after china vowed "more proactive" fiscal measures and "moderately" looser monetary policy next year to boost domestic consumption. The announcement came from an official readout of a key policy meeting that outlined upcoming economic priorities. Prior to the news, mainland China's CSI 300 index fell 0.17% to close at 3,966.57 after China's consumer price growth came in below expectations in November. CPI rose 0.2% year on year, down from a 0.3% increase in October, according to the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. Economists from Reuters forecast price growth of 0.5%. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific, markets were mixed as traders assessed revised economic growth data from Japan and South Korea's political situation. South Korea's Kospi stock index fell after President Yoon Suk Yeol survived an impeachment vote over the weekend as the fallout from his brief declaration of martial law continues to roil the country. The benchmark index fell 2.78% to 2,360.58, while the small-cap Kosdaq dropped 5.19% to 627.01 as investors continued to monitor the country's political situation. While Yoon's People Power Party boycotted the Saturday impeachment vote brought by opposition parties, its leader has said that Yoon would step down. Meanwhile, prosecutors in the country have named President Yoon as a subject in a criminal investigation for potential charges of treason and abuse of power, according to local media reports. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 0.18% to end the trading day at 39,160.5, while the Topix gained 0.27% to 2,734.56. The country's third-quarter gross domestic product was revised to 0.3% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, up from 0.2% and above estimates from a Reuters poll that predicted no change. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 ended marginally higher at 8,423. In the U.S. on Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose to fresh records after November jobs data came in slightly better than expected, but not so hot as to deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates again later this month. The broad market S&P 500 climbed 0.25% to 6,090.27. Tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 0.81% to 19,859.77, bolstered by gains in Tesla, Meta Platforms and Amazon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 123.19 points, or 0.28%, to close at 44,642.52. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq went on to their third straight positive week as well, rising 0.96% and 3.34%, respectively. The Dow slipped 0.6% during the period. — CNBC's Sean Conlon, Lisa Kailai Han and Pia Singh contributed to this report. China's leaders on Monday pledged "more proactive" fiscal measures and "moderately" looser monetary policy next year to boost domestic consumption, according to an official readout of a key policy meeting that outlined upcoming economic priorities. The Politburo, a top decision-making body led by President Xi Jinping, said it will stabilize property and stock markets while strengthening the "unconventional counter-cyclical" adjustment, the Communist Party's CNBC-translated readout said. Read the full story here. — Anniek Bao Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, says China needs more targeted and substantial fiscal stimulus measures, accompanied by confidence-building measures from the government. Speaking to CNBC's "Street Signs Asia," the economist said China's weak consumer inflation data released on Monday was "not surprising, but certainly disappointing." "This certainly gives the government a very important indication that the stimulus measures that have been put in place so far are not delivering the goods in terms of bolstering growth and bolstering private sector confidence," he said. He added that to get the economy back on track, the government will need to propose additional stimulus and confidence-building measures at its annual central economic work conference this week. — Dylan Butts Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top leaders are gearing up for the annual central economic work conference, reportedly set to take place this week, as Beijing strives to boost growth. While an official date for the two-day conclave has yet to be announced, Bloomberg has reported that the closed-door meeting will be held from Dec. 11 to 12. Usually, the annual conference is preceded by the high-profile gathering of the Politburo, the top decision making body led by president Xi. During both meetings, top policymakers will review economic performance and policy implementation in the current year, while setting priorities for the following year, economists at Goldman Sachs said. Read the full story here. — Anniek Bao South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok urged the National Assembly to speed up the finalization of the country's 2025 budget on Monday, according to a report from local media agency Yonhap. The country's government has been at a legislative standstill in the aftermath of President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief martial law declaration and subsequent events, with discussions on the 2025 budget proposal mostly stalled. Last month, the main opposition Democratic Party had tried to push through a smaller budget bill than that proposed by the ruling party. However, the National Assembly Speaker put the plan on hold, calling on rival parties to compromise. The Democratic Party is now reportedly pushing to pass its version of the budget in a plenary session set for Tuesday. — Dylan Butts China's consumer prices rose less-than-expected in November, climbing 0.2% from a year ago, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released Monday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a slight pickup in consumer prices to 0.5% in November from a year ago, versus 0.3% in October. China's producer price index declined for the 26th month. Producer inflation fell by 2.5% year on year in November, less than the estimated 2.8% decline as per the Reuters poll. The persistent near-zero inflation shows that China is still grappling with sluggish domestic demand and deflation at the wholesale level. This is in spite of Beijing's slate of stimulus efforts since September which has included interest rate cuts, support for the stock and property markets as well as efforts to boost bank lending. Read the full story here. — Lee Ying Shan 2024 has seen some massive stock rallies, as investor interest in themes such as AI has shown little sign of waning. As the year-end nears, CNBC Pro asked three fund managers what global stocks they are buying in the lead-up to 2025, as they attempt to get ahead of the curve. CNBC Pro subscribers can read more here. — Amala Balakrishner The S&P 500 is set for more gains in 2025, according to HSBC. The firm said it expects the broad market index to hit 6,700 by the end of next year, which implies more than 10% upside from Thursday's close. The index has already risen more than 27% this year. "While this year's equity rally was a mix of both earnings growth and a valuation re-rating (c50/50), we expect next year's equity returns to be focused on earnings growth as valuations are more stretched," analyst Nicole Inui told clients in a Friday note. "Overall, we expect earnings to grow by 9% incorporating a slower but still resilient US economy and some margin expansion." Inui also said she expects the U.S. economy to slow over the course of the next year but remain resilient as inflation eases. That would enable the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by another 125 basis points, she forecast. — Sean Conlon Despite the threat of tariffs next year, investors should stay bullish on stocks in 2025, according to UBS. "Heading into 2025, we think a constructive stance is warranted on global equities, and on U.S. stocks in particular," the bank wrote in a Friday report. "We note that historically U.S. equities tend to rally into presidential elections and after, with the average gain in the 150 trading days following an election averaging near 5% in data going back to 1928 for the S&P 500." UBS added that the U.S. sectors it views as most attractive are the technology, utilities and financial sectors. — Lisa Kailai Han The U.S. economy added 227,000 jobs in November, marking a sharp rebound from the previous month. Economist polled by Dow Jones expected an increase of 214,000 jobs for the month. Jobs growth for October was revised to 36,000 from 12,000. The unemployment rate came in at 4.2% for November, as was expected. — Fred Imbert Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: What We Got Right And Wrong In Our 2024 AI Predictions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2024/12/08/what-we-got-right-and-wrong-in-our-2024-ai-predictions/
Time Published: 2024-12-08T23:00:14Z
Full Content:
We predicted that Stability AI would shut down this year. The company has had a chaotic 2024 ... [+] punctuated by the departure of its CEO/cofounder Emad Mostaque, but it has not shut down. At this time last year, we published a list of 10 predictions about what would happen in the world of artificial intelligence in 2024. To keep ourselves honest, with 2024 now coming to a close, let’s revisit these predictions to see how things actually played out. There is much to learn from these retrospectives about the state of AI today. Interestingly, an online betting market about our 10 predictions popped up and has been active over the course of 2024. Take a look to see what the markets thought about our predictions. And keep an eye out for our 2025 AI predictions, coming out later this month! Nvidia invested heavily to expand its DGX Cloud offering in 2024, nearly tripling its quarterly spend on cloud services and leaving little doubt that it considers this a major strategic priority. It now touts case studies from numerous happy customers of its AI-focused cloud offering, from Amgen to Deloitte to ServiceNow. For now, Nvidia offers its cloud service in partnership with the major cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. But make no mistake: while Nvidia and the cloud providers are deeply reliant on each other today, these giants increasingly find themselves on a competitive collision course. Nvidia may hope to cut out the middleman by offering its chips directly to end customers rather than relying on the cloud vendors as intermediaries. Meanwhile, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all developing their own homegrown AI chips to lessen their dependence on and compete more directly with Nvidia. It will be fascinating to watch this “frenemy” dance play out in the years ahead. Things went from bad to worse for Stability AI at the beginning of 2024. CEO/founder Emad Mostaque was pushed out of the company in March. Several key personnel departed around the same time, including star researcher Robin Rombach, leading insiders to describe the company as “totally hollowed out” and “in a death spiral.” The company underwent a round of layoffs in April. It seemed as if Prediction 2 were bound to come true. But the company has not shut down. Over the summer, it hired a new CEO, managed to raise a lifeline of additional funding, and persuaded its cloud providers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in current and future debt. The company even convinced legendary filmmaker James Cameron to join its board of directors. The Stability AI that exists today may be a shell of its former headline-grabbing self, but the company remains a going concern. At least Andrej Karpathy agreed with the point we were making here. In a tweet a few months ago, Karpathy wrote: “It's a bit sad and confusing that ‘Large Language Models’ have little to do with language; it’s just historical. They are highly general purpose technology for statistical modeling of token streams. A better name would be Autoregressive Transformers or something. They don’t care if the tokens happen to represent little text chunks. It could just as well be little image patches, audio chunks, action choices, molecules, or whatever.” We agree. As we argued last year, we still maintain that “large language model” is not the best term for today’s frontier AI models. But the reality is that the terms “large language model” and “LLM” have not become any less widely used in 2024. Maybe in 2025 the terminology will begin to better align with the technology. The release of Meta’s state-of-the-art open-weight Llama 3 models this year, combined with persistent delays in the release of OpenAI’s GPT-5, may have made it tempting to conclude that the performance gap between closed and open models is closing. Then OpenAI dropped o1. o1, OpenAI’s new reasoning model, has opened up an entirely new vista in artificial intelligence research. In his seminal 2019 essay The Bitter Lesson, Rich Sutton emphasized “the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great.” Sutton posited that “the two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.” Before o1, frontier AI models relied heavily on the second method and largely neglected the first. o1 has changed this. Rather than improving AI by massively scaling learning during training, o1 introduces a new paradigm of massively scaling search during inference. Because it is so recent and so novel, o1’s full significance is not yet widely appreciated. But it will profoundly impact AI’s trajectory in the years ahead. It is true that open-weight alternatives to o1 have already emerged, mere months after o1’s launch, including some—like Alibaba’s QwQ-32B-Preview—that appear to rival o1 in performance. This is not surprising, and it does not change the fact that the most important zero-to-one innovations in AI continue to come out of the closed labs. As we wrote last year: “As in many other domains, catching up to the frontier as a fast follower, after another group has defined it, is easier to achieve than establishing a new frontier before anyone else has shown it is possible. For instance, it was considerably riskier, more challenging and more expensive for OpenAI to build GPT-4 using a mixture-of-experts architecture, when this approach had not previously been shown to work at this scale, than it was for Mistral to follow in OpenAI’s footsteps several months later with its own mixture-of-experts model.” In 2024, organizations from Eli Lilly to Morgan Stanley to Qualtrics to Accenture Federal Services announced that they were creating a Chief AI Officer (or equivalent) role, appointing leaders to oversee their organizations’ AI efforts. Considering that AI strategy remains a top priority for virtually every enterprise today, expect to see more companies follow suit in 2025. The transformer remains the dominant AI architecture today, by far. But 2024 proved to be the year that, to quote last year’s article, “a challenger architecture broke through and won real adoption, transitioning from a mere research novelty to a credible alternative AI approach used in production.” That alternative architecture is the state space model (SSM). Mamba, today’s most prominent state space model, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times on Hugging Face since its publication about a year ago. Mamba has inspired a number of variants that are in wide use today, from Vision Mamba to Mixture-of-Experts Mamba to MambaByte. As one example, well-funded Israeli startup AI21 Labs built its flagship model (named Jamba) on the Mamba architecture. Cartesia, a young startup out of Chris Ré’s Stanford lab focused on productizing and commercializing SSMs, has seen significant growth this year. Its generative audio models—built on the SSM architecture—have emerged as a serious challenger to industry leaders ElevenLabs and OpenAI thanks to their superior efficiency, latency and ability to handle long inputs. (Other challenger architectures also made progress this year—for instance liquid neural networks—but none have yet achieved the real-world adoption that state space models have.) Hyperscalers’ investments into AI startups have faced plenty of regulatory scrutiny this year. The FTC is actively investigating Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI. U.K. officials announced in October that they are looking into Google’s $2 billion investment into Anthropic. Regulators have also challenged Amazon’s investments in Anthropic and even Microsoft’s modest investment in Mistral, though these latter two have been cleared. These regulatory inquiries have centered more on antitrust concerns than on accounting violations associated with “roundtripping.” A steady drumbeat of news has come out over the course of 2024 pointing to the growing tension and misalignment between OpenAI and Microsoft. (A recent New York Times headline was worded almost identically to our prediction: “Microsoft and OpenAI’s Close Partnership Shows Signs of Fraying.”) OpenAI and Microsoft increasingly compete directly to sell similar AI products to the same enterprise customers. They have each struck deals this year to work with the other’s competitors, diversifying away from their once ironclad alliance. Microsoft has recently launched partnerships with Anthropic, Mistral and Cohere; OpenAI, for its part, announced a landmark alliance with Apple this summer. Other sources of friction that have spilled out into the open in 2024 include disputes over computing resources and the appointment of controversial DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman as Microsoft’s new AI chief. We wrote in last December’s predictions article: “Crypto is out of fashion right now, but make no mistake, another big bull run will come. In case you haven’t noticed, after starting the year under $17,000, the price of bitcoin has risen sharply in the past few months, from $25,000 in September to over $40,000 today. A major bitcoin upswing may be in the works, and if it is, plenty of crypto activity and hype will ensue.” This has proven prescient. Bitcoin has been on a tear in recent months, setting new all-time highs on a weekly basis. Three days ago the price of bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time ever, marking a major milestone. Venture funding has begun pouring back into crypto. With crypto-hater Gary Gensler out at the SEC and a crypto-friendly Trump administration about to take office, this bull run may just be getting started. So why did we grade this prediction as “Wrong”? While crypto has made a comeback in 2024, the hype and herd mentality around AI has in no way moderated since this time last year; it has only grown more deafening. Nearly three dozen lawsuits are underway in the United States today on the issue of whether generative AI models trained on internet data represent a violation of copyright, or conversely are protected by the fair use doctrine. Every major AI provider, from OpenAI to Anthropic to Meta, has been caught up in the litigation. But a meaningful ruling has not yet been issued in a single one of these cases. In other words, expecting this prediction to come true in 2024 reflected an overoptimistic assessment of how quickly U.S. courts move. But substantive rulings from the courts on these cases are coming soon. Summary judgment decisions are expected within months in two different cases on this topic, one against Nvidia and another against legal AI startup ROSS Intelligence. By the first or second quarter of 2025, we will have much more signal (though by no means the final verdict) about where courts are landing on this critical issue.

Title: Jordie Barrett makes try-scoring Leinster debut in Champions Cup win over Bristol

This was a curiously unexceptional game for large tracts of a windy night in Bristol, dominated by the French referee Pierre Brousset and a variety of incomplete or interminable scrums, which seemed like it would never end. Yet it was also truly memorable, not least as a potential sign of more great things to come, when Leinster introduced their A-listers and their ‘A’ game. Jordie Barrett having been introduced during the interval for what would be a quietly outstanding debut, within five minutes Leo Cullen completed probably the best quintet of substitutions in the history of the province, namely Andrew Porter, Thomas Clarkson, RG Snyman and Caelan Doris in addition to Barrett. Jacques Nienaber had warned that Bristol were the kind of team that could score 21 points in 17 minutes, but as it transpired it was Leinster that scored 21 points in a whirlwind six-minute spell. The big hitters were central to this salvo, not least the try-scoring, all-action Barrett, while Sam Prendergast capped off a typically cool night’s work in his first Champions Cup start to bookend that decisive spell with two tries in a 20-minute haul. Yet the night had not been without its difficulties, with Leinster reduced to 13 men, whereupon nobody stood up to be counted more than Josh van der Flier, who maintained his rich form from the Autumn Series with a deserving try of his own in man of the match performance. [ Toulouse run Ulster ragged in statement Champions Cup winOpens in new window ] While the TV pictures might have masked the conditions, there was a steady downpour in the opening quarter which thankfully abated but, in tandem with the swirling after-effects of Storm Darragh, made for a very scrappy opening. On the tightly cropped Ashton Gate surface used by Bristol City, players frequently lost their footing early on. This may also have contributed to the three penalties, and an indirect penalty, against Leinster at scrum time in addition to one in their favour as the typically fastidious and irritating Brousset renewed acquaintances with the ex-Clermont tighthead Rabah Slimani, who will be up against his former team at the Aviva next Saturday (5.30pm). Leinster were possibly a bit too elaborate and overplayed their hand and actually looked more dangerous through their all-or-nothing, fast defensive line speed than when they had the ball. The same was true of Bristol after losing their former Blackrock College product and Connacht Pro12-winning outhalf AJ MacGinty within five minutes when he was almost cut in two by the flying Garry Ringrose. Such were the reverberations from the tackle that MacGinty had to go off for an HIA and did not return. Leinster had survived a couple of five metre lineouts, James Ryan making one good steal, while van der Flier made inroads after a neat short side exchange with Rónan Kelleher before some sleight of hand on the deck went unseen. Prendergast was unlucky that his booming, spiralling 50 metre touch-finder was blown out on the full and when Jack Boyle was pinged for side entry, Kelleher was then binned for a similar offence before Max Deegan followed suit when tripping Fitz Harding in the act of tackling Harry Randall, which was actually quite a trick. Bristol launched Viliame Mata off the next five-metre lineout before Max Lahiff burrowed over and, trailing 7-0, Leinster had another seven minutes to survive with 13 men. But, necessity being the mother of invention, they did more than just survive. They were helped by James Dun spilling the restart, which Jordan Larmour retrieved and, with their numerical disadvantage, Leinster were obliged to be more direct. The fired-up van der Flier, responding to their moments of dire need, carried hard again and Jamison Gibson-Park worked a penalty advantage. Playing with house money, Prendergast chipped deftly and the added bonus was that Rich Lane slid into the ball and slid it into the waiting arms of Larmour who had followed up to gather and score. Prendergast used up the full allotment of time for the conversion and 7-7 at the break was a result for Leinster considering the penalty count was 9-3 against them. As well as the returning Deegan, Leinster welcomed Barrett aboard as a half-time replacement for Ciarán Frawley. Cue the rest of the Bomb Squad. Barrett, employed at inside centre with Robbie Henshaw moving to 13, Ringrose to the right wing and Larmour to the left, immediately made his mark with a good tackle to force a turnover. Yet, there was a little sign of their dramatic input to come initially when Brousset binned both Lahiff and the newly introduced Porter for stepping back when another scrum collapsed and his patience snapped. But, curiously it preceded the defining spell of the match and ironically the Leinster scrum was the platform. From a scrum to the left on the Bristol 22, Gibson-Park fed Barrett and Prendergast looped around to take the pullback and drift through an inviting gap before arcing and dummying to score under the posts. Within two minutes a scrum penalty for Leinster gave them an attacking lineout on the Bristol 22. The ever-alert Gibson-Prink spotted space on the fringe for a telling incision and two phases later Barrett took Gibson-Park’s pass and the Bristol defence bought his dummy as he sliced through himself. The ink barely dry in the referee’s notebook, Leinster struck again with the try of the match. Barrett’s pass had given the visitor’s the width in their own 22 when Doris and Snyman combined deftly to release the secondrow for one of his galloping breaks as he ate up about 40 metres and passed to Prendergast, who fended Randall and carried on from over 40 metes out for his second try. Stunning stuff. Almost funny. The fifth try was more prosaic, a nice launch from a fake maul set-up but a thoroughly deserving score for van der Flier, Prendergast’s conversion completing his 20-point haul. There was a consolation try by the quick-footed Gabriel Ibitoye when latching on to Kieran Marmion’s clever grubber, but the conversion was missed, meaning Leinster maintained their improved defensive record. Jacques Nienaber looked happy too. Scoring sequence: 30 mins: Lahiff try, van Rensburg con 7-0; 33: Larmour try, Prendergast con 7-7; Half-time 7-7; 53: Prendergast try and con 7-14; 56: Barrett try, Prendergast con 7-21; 58: Prendergast try and con 7-28; 65: van der Flier try, Prendergast con 7-35; 73: Ibitoye try 12-35.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other top AI news stories for the weekend. Last week, Sam Altman, CEO of AI company OpenAI, expressed his confidence that US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration will support the artificial intelligence sector, ensuring the United States and its allies continue their lead. Altman told US broadcaster Fox News that AI technology needed massive infrastructure support and that Trump would be ideal in providing it. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines “We need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology and the capabilities. I believe President-elect Trump will be very good at that”. Trump has already picked out Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks as his AI and Crypto czar, stating that Sacks will ensure the legal framework for the token has “clarity” to empower the crypto industry to “thrive”. Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks demonstrates his industry-friendly stance toward emerging technologies. “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship”. Meanwhile, SpaceX founder Elon Musk emerged as a key advisor to Trump after the elections. Musk has also been appointed to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is responsible for streamlining government bureaucracy. Musk having a potential political influence in the administration, particularly when it comes to AI, could get some people worried. However, prominent figures such as Sam Altman say they aren’t. Altman brushed off suggestions that Musk, the owner of X, would use legal tactics to shut down competitors. Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, is also confident about Musk’s influence on the Trump administration, stating how the influence is positive because Musk “deeply” knows artificial intelligence. The growing momentum of AI, underscored by recent government developments, has brought attention to other key players in the sector, including Anthropic, a leading AI-focused company. Anthropic is collaborating with Amazon to develop one of the world’s most powerful AI supercomputers. The mega-project, codenamed “Project Rainer,” will be five times larger than the cluster used to build Anthropic’s current most advanced model. As reported by WIRED, the announcement was made at the company’s Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas by Matt Garman, CEO of AWS. Once it is completed, the supercomputer will be the world’s largest AI machine featuring hundreds of thousands of its latest Trainium 2 AI training chips. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78 ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based platform that leverages AI and machine learning to enable enterprises to streamline workflow automation, enhance IT service management, and optimize other enterprise applications. On December 5, Analyst Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo assigned a “Buy” rating on ServiceNow with a price target of $1,250.00. Gina Mastantuono, company CFO, expressed cautious optimism regarding 2025 IT budgets, indicating potential growth beyond 2024. The company is well-suited to provide clients with both revenue-generating and cost-saving solutions. In particular, ServiceNow’s strong focus on artificial intelligence, predominantly through initiatives such as its early adoption through the Xanadu initiative and the Now Assist platform, puts it on track for future growth. The company’s focus on enhancing customer service through AI and database offerings, including RaptorDB Pro and Knowledge Graph, further emphasizes innovation and efficiency. Lastly, increased operating leverage and ongoing cost efficiencies solidify the buy rating. Overall, NOW ranks 1st on our list of top AI news stories for the weekend. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks that investors probably missed. AI is increasingly shaping diverse industries, from healthcare and website design to cybersecurity. Companies are utilizing traditional AI and generative models to improve diagnostics, customer experiences, and business efficiency. While AI offers immense benefits, it also presents new challenges, especially in securing sensitive data. As businesses continue to innovate with AI, balancing its advantages and potential risks will be crucial for future growth.

At the CNBC CFO Council Summit on December 4, Squarespace’s Nathan Gooden, Zoetis’s Wetteny Joseph, and Varonis’s Guy Melamed shared their insights on how artificial intelligence is being integrated into their businesses. From animal health and website development to cybersecurity, these executives discussed the ways AI is improving their operations, improving customer experiences, and addressing emerging challenges. They also explored the evolving role of generative AI and its potential impact on the future of their industries. Wetteny Joseph discussed how AI is being used in animal health, noting the integration of traditional AI in diagnostic platforms for animals, such as a system that quickly analyzes slide images to identify health issues, with potential to expand into human healthcare. Nathan Gooden highlighted the long-standing use of machine learning in the platform, and the incorporation of generative AI to simplify the website design process for customers. Guy Melamed mentioned AI’s dual impact: improving customer protection while also presenting risks, such as exposing sensitive data via AI tools like co-pilot. His company focuses on securing data and preventing unauthorized access through these AI systems.

OpenAI is considering removing a provision that would prevent Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from accessing its most advanced models once the company achieves artificial general intelligence (AGI), as per The Financial Times. Currently, the provision prohibits Microsoft from using AGI technology, which could limit the value of its partnership with OpenAI, especially given Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) significant investment of over $13 billion. OpenAI is restructuring to become a public benefit corporation and is discussing new terms with investors, including Microsoft. Overall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why Schlumberger Limited (SLB) is the Best Fuel Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Fuel Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) stands against other best fuel stocks to buy now. Fuel stocks, often referred to as energy stocks, represent shares of companies involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, as well as those specializing in drilling for these resources. Additionally, companies that refine crude oil into usable products, such as gasoline and diesel, also fall under this category. In an interview with Bloomberg on December 5, Amrita Sen, Founder and Director of Research at Energy Aspects, discussed the current state of the oil market and the upcoming OPEC+ meeting. Sen noted that OPEC+ members are unlikely to increase production, given the traditional maintenance season in Q1 and Q2, which typically leads to crude stock builds. Instead, she expects the group to delay the planned output to effectively get rid of the seasonal builds and reassess the market in the second half of the year. Sen highlighted that the current state of global inventories is incredibly low and that in the US, inventories are expected to end the year below 420 million barrels, which is at their lowest since 2007. Despite this, oil prices have been stuck at a low price, as analysts and industries are expecting a bearish 2025 and are discounting their current inventories When asked about the risk of a serious breakdown in OPEC+ members, Sen said that it is unlikely to happen as the members are committed to maintain a stable price, rather than engaging in a price war. She recalled the price war in April 2020, which led to a decline in prices, and said that OPEC ministers want to avoid a repeat of that scenario. While they do want prices to be higher, they also realize that if there is a breakdown and the market is not managed properly, prices can also go lower.

Sen agreed that the recent commencement of Canadian oil shipments to international markets via the Trans Mountain pipeline represents a significant development in the industry and has enabled Canadian producers to benefit from increased access to global markets. Sen notes that China has a strong preference for Canadian heavy oil, primarily due to its consistent quality, which is well-suited to the requirements of modern Chinese refineries. Sen also said that all the new refineries coming online in China, India, and other South Asian countries are primarily designed to process medium or heavy sour crude oil, and its demand is projected to reach a net 800,000 barrels per day. Sen pointed out that the refining capacity in regions such as Europe, North America, and other OECD countries is expected to decline, with a projected loss of 1 million barrels per day during the next year, comprising 400,000 barrels in Europe and an additional 400,000 in the United States, due to environmental concerns. Looking ahead to 2025, Sen expects the average oil price to average around $80 for Brent, but there are risks skewed to the upside due to the possible tightening of sanctions on Iran, Venezuela, and Russia under the Trump administration. Energy plays a crucial role in the global economy, as it provides the essential resources needed to power industries, transportation, and homes. The oil and gas industry continues to play a pivotal role in meeting the world’s energy needs, even as the push for cleaner alternatives gains momentum. To compile our list of the 8 best fuel stocks to buy now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 25 largest companies in the oil and gas sectors. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 8 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An aerial view of a well site, depicting the scale of oil and gas operations. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65 Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) is the world’s largest oilfield services company, delivering advanced technology and expertise to oil and gas operators worldwide. The company plays a crucial role in the industry by providing drilling, exploration, and production solutions to major clients, including ExxonMobil and Chevron. Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) is collaborating with next-generation companies to scale up technologies and make them accessible to its network of clients and customers. The company is partnering with ILiAD to scale up direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology. This technology has a significantly smaller physical footprint, reduced carbon emissions, and lower water usage compared to traditional lithium extraction methods. In Q3, Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) reported a 10% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $9.16 billion. This growth was driven by a 31% year-over-year revenue surge in its Production Systems segment to $3.1 billion and an 11% year-over-year rise in digital and integration revenue, fueled by the adoption of AI-powered tools and digital solutions. Regional growth was led by Europe & Africa and the Middle East & Asia, both recording 16% year-over-year revenue increases, while North America experienced modest growth of 3% year-over-year. Overall, SLB ranks 4th on our list of best fuel stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of SLB to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SLB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Clontarf end Ballynahinch’s winning run in AIL with dominant display
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/12/08/clontarf-end-ballynahinchs-winning-run-in-ail-with-dominant-display/

Far from being another tight arm wrestle, a strong Clontarf selection made something of a statement when ending the five-match winning run of leaders Ballynahinch at Ballymacarn Park with a 32-12 bonus-point win. By contrast, there was again late drama aplenty in the other four Division 1A games, which were decided by margins of four points or fewer. Storm Darragh’s slipstream ensured the wind was a significant factor throughout Saturday’s AIL programme, which almost survived intact. Clontarf laid the foundations into the first-half wind to lead 3-0 at half-time before maximising the elements. Tadgh Bird, whose move from fullback has helped to fill the Matt D’Arcy midfield void, crashed over for ‘Tarf’s first try before Conor Kelly scored off his own chip. Ballynahinch, missing some of their Ulster contingent, responded with Ethan Graham’s try before Aitzol King’s intercept try and after another for the hosts by Ronan McCusker, Bird took his seasonal tally to six when scoring for the fourth game running to clinch the bonus point. Newly promoted St Mary’s went top with a hard-earned 26-24 win over Young Munster at Templeville Road. St Mary’s led 12-0 through tries by Tom O’Reilly and Myles Carey, before tries by Manuel Covella, Shane O’Leary and Oisín Pepper, the latter with a fine chip and chase, put Munster 17-12 ahead only for Michael Silvester’s try to leave the home side 19-17 ahead at the break. Munster led through Covella’s second try before Dan Goggin finished off a multiphase attack against his old club and Conor Hayes, another ex-Munster man, landed the winning conversion from the touchline in the swirling wind. Terenure remain fourth after playing a get-out-of-jail card at a blowy Bowl. They led 21-17 when Conor Phillips’ intercept try augmented first-half scores by Craig Adams and Alan Bennie but UCD, stacked with eight Leinster academy players, looked likely winners after Conor Ó Tighearnaigh’s bonus-point try put them 24-21 ahead. Levi Vaughan made inroads off an overthrow before Chris Cosgrave levelled with a wind-assisted penalty from inside halfway and after the restart went out on the full, Harrison Brewer’s charge up the middle was deliberately knocked on for Cosgrave to land the winning penalty with the game’s last kick. Con remain fifth after a hard-earned 19-17 win away to a game Garryowen side with a number of Munster academy players. Two Brian Gleeson tries and a Dylan Hicks penalty had Garryowen 17-14 in front but Con, who had scored first-half tries through Scott Buckley, after three successive penalties off lineout mauls, and a well-worked try by the recalled Matthew Bowen, won courtesy of a late penalty try from another catch-and-drive. It was awarded by American referee Lee Wiener, who had earlier sinbinned two Con players for high hits. Similarly, both sides played better into the wind at the Palace Grounds, where Lansdowne prevailed by 19-15 over City of Armagh thanks to Andy Marks’ sixth try of the season, a timely fillip before hosting leaders on the Aviva back pitch next Friday night. Men’s Division 1A: Garryowen 17 Cork Constitution 19; Ballynahinch 12 Clontarf 32; City of Armagh 15 Lansdowne 19; St. Mary’s College 26 Young Munster 24; UCD 24 Terenure College 27. Division 1B: Blackrock College 25 UCC 5; Highfield 17 Queens 35; Nenagh Ormond 19 Naas 18; Old Belvedere 39 Shannon 24; Old Wesley 38 Dublin University 17.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm. It seems that major tech companies in Silicon Valley are forging relationships with the defense industry these days. In the latest news, prominent artificial intelligence company OpenAI has entered a partnership with Anduril, a defense startup that produces missiles, drones, and software for the United States military. READ NOW: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss. The companies said that this partnership will emphasize on the improvement of the United States' counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) as well as their ability to deal with potentially lethal aerial threats in real-time. The CUAS will enable defense against drone strikes by detecting and intercepting them while they are airborne. According to Brian Schimpf, cofounder and CEO of Anduril, OpenAI’s AI models will be used to improve systems used for air defense. The technology will be used to “assess drone threats more quickly and accurately, giving operators the information they need to make better decisions while staying out of harm’s way”, revealed a former OpenAI employee. “OpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values… Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects US military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.” Last month, OpenAI rival Anthropic also entered a partnership with a famous defense contractor to provide “US intelligence and defense agencies” access to its AI models. Regardless of its competitors' actions, OpenAI shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. After months of tender offers and a soaring valuation, the company has reached a new record of 300 million weekly active users. The announcement was made by Sam Altman during an appearance at The New York Times’ Dealbook Conference on Wednesday, December 4th. The company is reportedly targeting 1 billion active users by next year. These strategies aim to strengthen OpenAI's position against competitors Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI, the latter of which Sam Altman considers a “fierce competitor”. Besides that, it is also striving to gain a larger slice of the generative AI market, which may top $1 trillion in revenue by the next decade. Altman also revealed that his company hasn’t asked investors not to invest in its competitors. However, those who decide to wouldn’t have access to OpenAI’s “information rights,” like the company’s roadmap and other materials. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has fortified its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal artificial intelligence system. On December 6, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is gearing up to launch one of its most-awaited projects: the series of cellular modem chips that aim to replace components from long-time partner and rival Qualcomm. Reportedly, Apple’s in-house modem system will debut next spring. This technology is said to be part of the iPhone SE, the company’s entry-level smartphone. The iPhone SE will be updated next year for the first time since 2022. When the iPhone SE debuts in a few months, it is going to have new features such as Apple Intelligence and the edge-to-edge screen design already used in more upscale models. However, the breakthrough is going to be its in-house modem, code-named Sinope. Currently, the modem won’t be used in Apple’s higher-end products but is set to come to a new mid-tier iPhone later next year, code-named D23. Apple’s entry-level iPads will also witness the chip debut as early as 2025. Overall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: What is high bandwidth memory and why is the US trying to block China’s access to it? | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. The US government has imposed fresh export controls on the sale of high tech memory chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications to China. The rules apply to US-made high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology as well as foreign-produced ones. Here’s everything you need to know about these cutting-edge semiconductors, which have seen demand soar along with the global frenzy for AI. High bandwidth memory (HBM) are basically a stack of memory chips, small components that store data. They can store more information and transmit data more quickly than the older technology, called DRAM (dynamic random access memory). HBM chips are commonly used in graphic cards, high-performance computing systems, data centers and autonomous vehicles. Most importantly, they are indispensable to running increasingly popular AI applications, including generative AI, which are powered by AI processors, such as the graphic processing units (GPU) produced by Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). “The processor and the memory are two essential components to AI. Without the memory, it’s like having a brain with logic but not having any memory,” G Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, a research organization specializing in chips, told CNN. The latest set of export restrictions, announced on December 2, follow two previous rounds of curbs on advanced chips announced by the Biden administration over three years years, with a view to blocking China’s access to critical technology that could give it a military edge. As retaliation, Beijing hit back by imposing fresh curbs on exports of germanium and gallium and other materials elements essential for making semiconductors and other high tech equipment. Experts say the latest export restrictions will slow China’s development of AI chips and, at most stall, its access to HBM. While China’s ability to produce HBM currently lags South Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung and America’s Micron (MU), it is developing its own capabilities in the area. “What the US export restrictions would do is cut China’s access to HBM of better quality in the short run,” said Jeffery Chiu, CEO of Ansforce, an expert network consultancy specializing in tech, told CNN. “In the long run though, China will still be able to produce them independently, albeit with less advanced technologies.” In China, Yangtze Memory Technologies and Changxin Memory Technologies are the leading manufacturers of memory chips. They are purportedly ramping up capacity to build HBM production lines to fulfill its strategic goal of tech self-sufficiency. What makes HBM chips so powerful is primarily their larger storage space and much faster speed of passing along data, compared to conventional memory chips. Because AI applications require a lot of complex computing, such traits ensure that these applications run smoothly, without delays or glitches. Larger storage space means more data can be stored, transmitted and processed, which enhances the performance of AI applications as the large language models (LLM) enable them to have more parameters to train on. Think of the faster speed of sending over data, or higher bandwidth in chips parlance, as a highway. The more lanes a highway has, the less likely there will be a bottleneck and thus the more cars it can accommodate. “It’s like the difference between a two-lane highway and a hundred-lane highway. You just don’t get traffic jams,” said Hutcheson. Currently, just three companies dominate the global market of HBM. As of 2022, Hynix accounted for 50% of the total market share for HBM, followed by Samsung at 40% and Micron at 10%, according to a research note published by Taipei-based market research agency TrendForce. Both South Korean firms are expected to take on similar shares in the HBM market in 2023 and 2024, collectively commanding around 95%. As for Micron, the company aims to grow its HBM market share to somewhere between 20% and 25% by 2025, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported, citing Praveen Vaidyanatha, a senior executive at Micron. The high value of HBM has led to all manufacturers dedicating a significant portion of its manufacturing capacity towards the more advanced memory chip. According to TrendForce’s Senior Research Vice President Avril Wu, HBM is expected to account for more than 20% of the total market for standard memory chips by value starting in 2024 and potentially exceeding 30% by next year. Imagine stacking multiple standard memory chips in layers like a hamburger. That is essentially the structure of HBM. On the surface it sounds simple enough, but it is no easy feat to pull off, so much so that it reflects on the price. The unit sales price of HBM is several times higher than that of a conventional memory chip. That is because the height of an HBM is roughly that of six strands of hair, which means each layer of those standard memory chips that are stacked together need to be extremely thin as well, a feat that calls for top-notch manufacturing expertise known as advanced packaging. “Each of those memory chips need to be ground to as thin as the height of half a strand of hair before they are stacked together, something very difficult to pull off,” said Chiu. In addition, holes are drilled on these memory chips before they are mounted on top of each other for electric wires to pass through, and the position and size of these holes need to be extremely precise. “You have a lot more failure points when you try to make these devices. It’s almost like building a house of cards,” Hutcheson said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

This was in sharp contrast to their net outflows of ₹21,612 crore in November 2024 and massive net withdrawal of ₹94,017 crore recorded in October 2024. Prior to the latest turnaround, FPIs had remained net sellers for eight consecutive weeks. In September, FPIs had bought Indian equities worth ₹57,724 crore. The robust buying was prompted by BJP-led combine making a strong comeback in Maharashtra and US equity benchmarks clocking new all time highs. Taking the latest robust December inflows into account, FPIs have so far this calendar year pumped in ₹9,435 crore in India as compared to net outflows of ₹15,019 crore at the end of November, depositories data showed. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said that FPIs turning buyers in early December, in total reversal of their sustained selling strategy during the last two months, has altered the market sentiments. “In December, through 6th, FPIs have turned buyers having bought equity for ₹17,921 crores through exchanges. Including the purchases through the primary market, the total FPIs buying through December 6th stood at ₹24,453 crores”, he said. This is a clear change in FPI strategy in India. “It can be argued that the stage of relentless FPI selling is over”, Vijayakumar added. Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director – Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, said “Looking ahead, the flow of foreign investments into Indian equity markets will hinge on several key factors. These include the policies implemented under Donald Trump’s presidency, the prevailing inflation and interest rate environment, and the evolving geopolitical landscape”. Additionally, the third-quarter earnings performance of Indian companies and the country’s progress on the economic growth front will play a crucial role in shaping investor sentiment and influencing foreign inflows, he said. Srivastava said there could be few probable reasons for this sharp u-turn by FPIs towards Indian equities in December after selling around $14 billion between October and November. The recent correction in the market could have prompted them to build some exposure. Uncertainty over Chinese equities on the back of proposed tariffs by US President-elect Donald Trump on China and other several nations could have prompted FPIs to look back at Indian equities which offers a much clearer long term growth prospects, despite relatively high valuations, he said. Additionally, FPIs might have decided to rejig their portfolios a bit towards India given suboptimal GDP number would have fanned hopes that RBI might soon have to start cutting rates to boost the economy, which in turn might boost the equity markets. For the uninitiated, in its recent monetary policy review on December 6, 2024, RBI had cut CRR by 50 bps to 4 per cent, while keeping repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent, he noted.

Title: » A Conversation with Andrew Plotkin The Digital Antiquarian

For some of you, Andrew Plotkin will need no introduction. The rest of you ought to know that he’s quite an amazing guy, easily one of the half-dozen most important figures in the history of post-Infocom interactive fiction. By my best reckoning, he’s written an even dozen fully realized, polished text adventures in all, from 1995’s A Change in the Weather, the co-winner of the very first IF Competition, to his 2014 Kickstarter-funded epic Hadean Lands. While he was about it, he made vital technical contributions to interactive fiction as well; perhaps most notably, he invented a new virtual machine called Glulx, which finally allowed games written with the Inform programming language to burst beyond the boundaries of Infocom’s old Z-Machine, while the accompanying Glk input-output library allowed then to make use of graphics, sound, and modern typography. Over the last ten years or so, Andrew — or “Zarf,” as his friends who know him just a little bit better than I do generally call him — has moved into more of an organizing role in the interactive-fiction community, taking steps to place it on a firm footing so that its most important institutions can outlive old-timers like him and me. Andrew was kind enough to sit down with me recently for a wide-ranging conversation that started with his formative years as an Infocom superfan in the 1980s, went on to encompass some of his seminal games and other contributions of the 1990s and beyond, and wound up in the here and now. I hope you’ll enjoy reading this transcript of our discussion as much as I enjoyed chatting with Andrew screen to screen. He’s refreshingly honest about the sweet and the bitter of being a digital creator working mostly in niche forms. One final note before we get started: Andrew is currently available for contract or full-time employment. If you have need of an experienced programmer, systems architect, writer, and/or game designer whose body of work speaks for itself, you can contact him through his website. The munchkin Zarf, 1971. Perhaps we should start with some very general background. Have you lived in the Boston area your whole life? No, not at all! I only moved to Boston in 2005. I was born in 1970 in Syracuse, New York, a place that I don’t remember at all because my family moved to New Jersey when I was about three. We lived there for a couple of years, then my father got a job in the Washington, D.C., area. I went to primary school through high school there. And when and where did you first encounter interactive fiction? It must have been around 1979. My father’s company had a “bring your family to work” day. A teletype there was running Adventure. My father plunked me down in front of it and explained what was going on. I thought it was the best thing in the universe. I banged on it for a couple of hours while everybody else was running around the office, although I didn’t get very far. For the next few months, Dad was playing it at work, illicitly — that was how everybody played it. He would bring home these giant sheets of fan-fold printer paper showing his latest progress. As I recall, I suggested the solution to the troll-bridge puzzle: giving the golden eggs to the troll. That was great, the first adventure-game puzzle I solved. When did you first get a computer at home? Around 1980, we got an Apple II Plus. We acquired the first three Scott Adams games and Zork, which was newly available, plus Microsoft’s port of Adventure to the Apple II. Andrew’s bar mitzvah cake took the form of an Apple II. That started my lifelong attachment to Infocom. I played all the games as they came out. I begged my folks to buy them for me. Later, I spent my own money on them. You played all of the Infocom games upon their first release? Pretty much, up until I went off to college. I remember that I did not play Plundered Hearts when it came out. That one was a hard sell for a lot of young men — although it’s a brilliant game. Yeah. I didn’t play it because I was a seventeen-year-old boy. I also didn’t play Zork Zero or the [illustrated] games that came after it because I had gone off to college and didn’t have the Apple II anymore. But I did catch up with all of them a few years later. You mention that you did get some adventure games from other companies when you first got the Apple II. Did that continue, or were you exclusively loyal to Infocom? Well, I was haunting the download BBSes and snarfing any pirated game I could. I played Wizardry and Ultima. I didn’t play too many other text adventures. I knew they existed — I had seen ads for Mike Berlyn’s pre-Infocom stuff — but I didn’t really hunt them down because I knew that Infocom was actually better at it. I remember that we had The Wizard and the Princess, which was just clunky and weird and not actually solvable. I know that you also wrote some of your own text adventures on the Apple II in BASIC, as a lot of people were doing at this time. Yes. The first one I did was a parody of Enchanter. I called it Enchanter II. It was a joke game that I could upload to the BBSes: “Look, it’s the sequel!” It was very silly. It started out pretending to be an Infocom game, then started throwing in Doctor Who jokes. The closing line was, “You may have lost, but we have gained,” the ending from the Apple II Prisoner game. It was terrible. But I did write it and release it. Unfortunately, as far as I know it’s lost. I’ve never seen it archived anywhere. I did Inhumane after that. That was another parody game, but it was meant to have actual puzzles. It was inspired by the Grimtooth’s Traps role-playing books. I liked the idea of people dying in funny ways. Inhumane is obviously juvenilia, but at the same time it shows some of what was to come in your games. There’s a subversive angle to it: here’s a game full of traps where the objective is to hit all the traps. That’s the way I play a lot of games, but inadvertently. Here that’s the point. Were you heavily into tabletop RPGs? No. Tabletop role-playing I was never into. I get performance anxiety when I’m asked to come up with stories on the fly. I just don’t enjoy sitting at a table and being in that position. It’s not my thing. But I was interested in role-playing scenarios and source books. First, because of the long-term connection to [computer] adventure games, second because they had so much creative world-building and storytelling, just to read. So, yeah. I was interested in tabletop role-playing games but not in actually playing them. A surprising number of people have told me the same: they never played tabletop RPGs much but they liked the source books. For some people, the imagination that goes into those is enough, it seems. So, you go off to university. Why did you choose Carnegie Mellon University? I got rejected by MIT! It was second on the list. Were you aware that Infocom was connected so closely to MIT? No. I knew that they were in Cambridge because I subscribed to the Status Line newsletter. There was a running theme of them mentioning stuff around Cambridge. And I’d played The Lurking Horror. But I didn’t have the full context of “these were MIT students who made Zork at MIT.” I guess it would have made the rejection even more painful if you’d known. At university, you’re exposed to Unix and the Mac for the first time. Yes. And to the Internet. And I started learning “real” programming languages like C. Did you also play games at university? Yes. I ran into roguelikes for the first time. Which ones did you play? I played a fair bit of Advanced Rogue, but I never got good at it. There were people playing NetHack, but it was clear that that was a game where you had to put in a lot of time to make any serious progress. Rogue was a little bit lighter. Yeah. I never was willing to put in the hours and hours that it takes to get good at those games. Now especially, when I write about so many games, I just don’t have the time to devote 200 hours to NetHack. You’ve since re-implemented one of your own programming experiments from university, Praser 5. That was not originally a parser-based text adventure. It was a puzzle stuck inside the CMU filesystem. Every “room” was a directory, connected by symlinks. You literally CDed into the directory and typed “ls,” and the description would pop up in the file listing. Then you would type, “cd up,” “cd left,” whatever, to follow symlinks to other directories. It was an experiment in using the tools of a shared computer system to make an embedded game. The riddles were a matter of running a small executable which was linked in each directory. I used file permissions to give people access to more things as they solved more puzzles. Much later, after I had learned Inform 6, I did the parser version. What did you do right after university? I graduated in 1992, but I wanted to stick around the Pittsburgh area because a lot of my friends hadn’t graduated yet. I got a job in the CMU computer-science department and shacked up with a couple of classmates in a rundown apartment. That was great. I bought my first Macintosh and started writing stuff on it. That’s when I started working on System’s Twilight. I figured it was time for me to get into my games career. I decided to write a game and release it as shareware to make actual money. So, I bought a tremendous number of Macintosh programming manuals, which I still have. System’s Twilight has the fingerprints of Cliff Johnson of Fool’s Errand fame all over it. Yes. It was an homage. When did you first play his games? Was that at university? Yeah. Those came out between 1988 and 1992, when I was there. I had a campus job, so I could afford a couple of games. I played them on the campus Macintoshes. I remember very well being in one of the computer clusters at two in the morning, solving the final meta-puzzle of The Fool’s Errand. I had written down all of the clues the game had fed me on papers that were spread out all over the desk. Every time I used one of the clues, I’d grab the piece of paper, crumple it up, and throw it over my shoulder. When I finished, the desk was empty and I was surrounded by paper. We had an amazing experience with The Fool’s Errand as well. My wife fell in love with it. It was our obsession for two weeks. When I talked to Cliff Johnson years ago, my wife told me to tell him that he was the only man other than me that she could see herself marrying. I wasn’t sure how to take that. What were your expectations for System’s Twilight? I intended to make some money. I didn’t know how much would show up or whether it would lead to more things. It was just something I could do that would be a lot more fun than the programming I was doing in my day job. Now that you had your own Macintosh and a steady income, I guess you started buying more commercial games again? I know you have a huge love for Myst, which came out around this time. I was actually a little bit late to Myst. I didn’t play it until 1994, when everybody was already talking about it. But when you did, it was love at first sight? Yeah. The combination of the environment and the soundscape was great and the puzzles were fun. It felt like someone was finally doing the graphical adventure right. I’d never gotten into the LucasArts and Sierra versions of graphical adventures because they were sort of parodic, and the environments weren’t actually attractive. They were very pixelated. They just weren’t trying to be immersive. But Myst was doing it right. As long as we’re on the subject: I guess Riven absolutely blew your mind? Yes, it did. It was vastly larger and more interesting and more cohesively thought-through than Myst had been. I played it obsessively and solved it and was very happy. At what point did you get involved with the people who would wind up being the founders of a post-Infocom interactive-fiction community? In 1993 or 1994, someone pointed me to an open-source Infocom interpreter. I hadn’t really been aware of the technology stack behind Infocom’s games. But now you could pull all of the games off of the Lost Treasures disks and run them on Unix machines. That was kind of interesting. I don’t remember how I encountered the rec.arts.int-fiction newsgroup. But when I did, people were talking about reverse-engineering the Infocom technology. I wrote an interpreter of my own for [Unix] X Windows that had proportional fonts, command-line editing, command history, scroll bars — all the stuff we take for granted nowadays. I released that, then ported it to the Macintosh. That was my first major interaction with rec.arts.int-fiction. It must have been around this time that Kevin Wilson made a very historically significant post on Usenet, announcing the very first IF Competition. You submitted A Change in the Weather and won the Inform category. Did you write that game specifically for the Comp? Let me back up a little bit. In early 1995, I got an offer from a game company in Washington, D.C, called Magnet Interactive, to port games from 3DO to Macintosh. So, I moved to Washington — I was very sad to leave Pittsburgh behind — and rented a terrible little rundown apartment there. I was also making some money from System’s Twilight, and had started working on a sequel, which was to be called Moondials. It was a slog. I had some ideas for puzzles, but the story was just not coming together. So, when Kevin Wilson said, “Hey, let’s do this thing,” I said, “I’m going to take a break from Moondials and write a text adventure very fast.” The process started with downloading Inform 5 and the manual and reading it. I think I blasted through the manual five times in a week. The start of the Competition was a little weird because we didn’t yet have the idea of all of the games being made available at the same time. Kevin just said, “Upload your games to the IF Archive.” So, all of the games trickled in at different times. For the second Comp, we settled very firmly on the idea of all games being released at the same time because the 1995 experience was not very satisfactory. I know that it’s always frustrating to be asked where ideas come from. But sometimes it’s unavoidable, so I’m going to ask it about A Change in the Weather. I think I was drawing on the general sense of being an introvert and not making friends easily — being separated from people and feeling alienated from my social group. My college experience wasn’t solidly that. I was an introvert, but I was at a computer college, and there were a lot of introverts and introvert-centered social groups. I had friends, had housemates after college, as I said. But I still struggled somewhat with social activities. It was a failure mode I was always aware of, that I might end up on the edge not really talking to people. I drew on that experience in general in creating the scenario of A Change in the Weather. That’s interesting. From my outsider perspective, I can see that much more in So Far, your next game. It really dwells on this theme of alienation and connection, or the lack thereof. That also strikes me as the game of yours that’s most overtly influenced by Myst. Just from the nature of the environment and the magical-mechanical puzzles. It’s not deserted like Myst, but you can’t interact in any meaningful way with the people who are there — which goes back to this theme of alienation. I wasn’t thinking of Myst specifically there, but it was part of my background by that point. The direct emotional line in So Far was breaking up with my college girlfriend. That was a couple of years in the past by this point. That had been in Pittsburgh. A lot of the energy for working on System’s Twilight came from suddenly being stuck at home after that relationship ended. I channeled my frustrations into programming. But then I tried to drop it into So Far as a theme of people being separated. None of the specifics of what had happened were relevant to the game — just the feeling. By the time of So Far, you were as big as names get in modern interactive fiction. Your next game Lists and Lists was arguably not a game at all. What made you decide to write a LISP tutorial as interactive fiction? Do you have a special relationship with LISP? Yes! I hate it! I had taken functional-programming courses in college and learned LISP. But I just did not jibe with it at all. That’s ironic because Infocom’s programming language ZIL was heavily based on LISP. Right. It was an MIT thing, but it was not my thing. Nevertheless, the concept of building it into the Z-Machine with a practical limit of 64 K of RAM — or really less than that — seemed doable. And I had written a LISP interpreter as a programming exercise during my first or second year in college. So, I was aware of the basics. Doing it in Inform wasn’t a gigantic challenge, just a certain amount of work. Were you already starting to feel restless with the traditional paradigm of interactive fiction? Right after Lists and Lists, you released The Space Under the Window, which might almost work better if it was implemented in hypertext. It’s almost interactive poetry. I wasn’t bored with traditional games, but I did want to try different things and see what could be done. And writing in Inform was simple enough that I could just whip out an idea and see whether it worked. That was inspiring the whole community at this point. That was the lesson of the first IF Comp: you can just sit down and try an idea, and a month later people will be talking about it. There was a very rapid fermentation cycle. Yes. It led to much more formal experimentation. Before the Comp came along, everybody was trying to follow the Infocom model and make big games. But if you have an idea that’s more conceptual or avant garde, it’s often better suited to a smaller game. The Comp created a space for that. If you do something and submit it to the Comp, even if it’s highly experimental, it will get played and noticed and discussed. Now we come to The Big One of your games in many people’s eyes. And I must admit that this applies to me as well. Spider and Web is such a brilliantly conceived game. I’m in awe of this game. So, thank you for that. You’re welcome. It’s always tricky to have a game which is so purely built out of a single idea because then, when you try to write another game, you think you have to come up with another idea that’s as good, and it’s never possible. Was this idea born out of any particular experience, perhaps with other media? I don’t think it was. I was prying into what we would now call the triangle of identities — prying into the idea that what the game’s text is telling you is a point of view that might have biases behind it. There is a dialog between what the player thinks about the world and what the game thinks about the world, and there can be cracks in between. That led to the idea of using the storytelling of the game to tell a lie, and that there is a truth behind it which can be discerned. I started with that kernel and started coming up with puzzle scenarios. Here is an outcome that is verifiable. But there’s two different versions of what happened that could have led to that outcome. I’m going to tell one, but the other is going to be the truth. I strung together a few different versions of that. Then I said, okay, if we’re lying, then the introduction of the game has to introduce the lie. So I folded that in from the start. I knew that I wanted a two-part structure: you learn what’s going on, then you make use of all of the information. The moment of transition between the two is often referred to as simply The Puzzle. It’s been called the best single text-adventure puzzle ever created. Did you realize how special it was at the time? No. I figured it would be a puzzle. I didn’t understand how much of an impact it would have. I knew that I wanted to surprise players by having a possibility suddenly become available. Here’s a thing that I can do, and I will do it. Any kind of good puzzle solution is a surprise when you think of it. Afterward it seems obvious. I knew I had a good combination of elements to make it work, but I wasn’t thinking about the way that it would reorient the entire history of the game in the player’s head in one fell swoop. I don’t know. Maybe I had an inkling. What I love is that the game is called Spider and Web. Suddenly when you solve that puzzle, those two categories get reversed. Who is really the spider and who is caught in the web? The reason I called it Spider and Web was actually the old idiom “What a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive.” The notion of deception was meant to be part of the title, and the spider was there just to go with the web. But yes, it’s multi-valent. I know you’re a big reader of science fiction and fantasy. I wouldn’t picture you reading a James Bond novel. What made you decide to go in the direction of spy fiction here? Honestly, I thought of it as science fiction. The spy fiction was merely because the story was about deception, and somebody had to be fooling somebody. But conceptually, I had it pinned as a science-fiction scenario from some kind of dystopian cold war, but with magically advanced technology. You entered Hunter, in Darkness into the 1999 IF Comp. It’s a riff on Hunt the Wumpus, which is about the most minimalist imaginable text adventure, if you can even call it that. Your game, by contrast, is a lushly atmospheric, viscerally horrifying fiction. Were you just being cheeky? Yeah, I was. I just wanted to put in all the stuff that Wumpus didn’t have, without getting away from the core concept. I thought it would be a funny thing to do. I worked really hard on the claustrophobia and the creepy bats. I remember crawling under a chair to try to get the feel of being in a narrow passage and not being able to move around — just to get the bodily sense of that. Then we have Shade from 2000, which is another of my favorites of your games. Even more than Hunter, in Darkness, it has a horror vibe. Yes. I leaned into it harder in Shade. There are all kinds of opinions about what is really going on in Shade. I know you like to let people draw their own conclusions about your games, so I won’t press you on that… I don’t think there’s a lot of disagreement on the main point, that you’re dying and this is all a hallucination. Yeah, that was absolutely my take on it, that you’re dying of thirst in the desert. I saw it pointed out in a review that everything you’re trying to do is the opposite of the real problem you have. You’re trying to get out of your apartment in the hallucination, but your real problem is that you are out, lost in the desert. Was that something you were consciously doing, or are we all reading too much into it? Well, neither. I don’t think I was consciously thinking that way, but that doesn’t mean that you’re reading stuff into it. It’s deliberately ambiguous. I had a lot of images in my head that I threw out at random. I did have the notion that this environment in your apartment was from your past. You really had packed up your apartment and called a taxi and gotten out, and reiterating it was… inappropriate but real. It was in your head while you were having this terrible experience, and it was being replayed by your brain in a broken way. You’re in a place of blinding light — it’s very hot — and the experience you’re replaying is very dim and dark, except that when light occurs it’s painful. A rare 1999 meeting in the flesh of interactive-fiction luminaries. From left: Andrew Plotkin, Chris Klimas, David Dyte, and Adam Cadre. Although your games of the 1990s are fondly remembered and still played, you were also making major technical contributions. Probably most important was the Glulx — sorry, I can’t say that word! — virtual machine to let Inform games expand beyond the strictures of Infocom’s old Z-Machine. How did that come about? No one knows how to pronounce it! I started to think about it in probably 1996, when Graham [Nelson] came out with version 7 and 8 of the Z-Machine. Version 8 was big — big enough for Graham’s Jigsaw — but it was still just a stopgap. It was only twice as big as Infocom’s version 5. There were all kinds of things that didn’t scale. It seemed worthwhile to make a fresh design that would be 32-bit from the start. I just didn’t want to deal with more incremental changes. And being able to jettison all of the weird legacy stuff about the Z-Machine seemed like a win too — being able to rethink all of these decisions in a technological context that is not 1979. One of the things I wanted to do was to separate out the input-output layer. I had already written Z-Machine interpreters for X Windows and Mac that used Mark Howell’s ZIP engine with different interface front-ends. When TADS went open-source around 1997, I made an interpreter for that. So, now I had this matrix, right? I’ve got an X Windows front-end and a Mac front-end, and they both slap onto the Z-Machine and the TADS virtual machine. In a pretty clear way, these things are just plug and play. All the virtual machine does is accept text input and generate text output. I mean, yes, there’s the status line, maybe sound and graphics, but fundamentally that’s what it’s doing. And the front-end presents that text in a way that suits the platform on which it’s running. I was doing the same thing that Infocom did, just slicing it into more layers. Infocom had an interpreter and a game file. I said, we’re going to have an interpreter engine and an interpreter front-end. Thus there will be more flexibility. I designed the front-end first, the Glk library. I made an implementation for Mac and for X Windows and for the Unix command line. Then I started thinking about the virtual machine. I ripped apart the Inform 6 compiler so it could compile to Glulx from the same game source code. As I recall, the Glulx virtual machine is bigger than the Z-Machine — for all practical purposes, its capacity is infinite — but also simpler. There’s less of the hard-coded stuff that Infocom included, like the object tables. Yes, exactly. I figured the more generic and simple I could make it, the better. It would be simpler to design and simpler to implement. It adds complexity to the compiler, but the compiler already needs code to generate object tables in a specific format. It would still be doing that, but there wouldn’t be any hardware support for them. I’d just have to include veneer routines to handle object tables in this format. Then, if we ever need to change the format, no problem. We just change the compiler. We don’t need to change the virtual machine. When did you publish the Glulx specification? April 1, 1999. Were you still living in Washington, D.C., at this time? I had moved around a lot, actually. The job in D.C. only lasted about a year and a half. After the porting project I had been doing finished up, the company dropped me onto a project to do a Highlander licensed game, which we had absolutely no concept of how to do. This would have been like a 3D action game. That project got canned. Then I worked for a document company in Maryland for a while. Then I moved back to Pittsburgh and worked for a startup. The startup got acquired by Red Hat, and they moved us down to North Carolina. That was from like 1999 to 2000. Then Red Hat fired us and I moved back to Pittsburgh. From 2000 to 2005 I worked for a filesystem company in Pittsburgh. You took a break from writing interactive fiction for a few years after Shade. Then there was a little bit of a shift in focus when you did come back in 2004 with The Dreamhold. Your earlier games don’t try too hard to be accessible. When you returned, you seemed more interested in outreach and accessibility. What was the thought process there? Only the obvious one. It’s true that all of my previous games were written very much for the community. They were written for people who knew how IF worked. But The Dreamhold was specifically an outreach game. I wanted to try to expand the community. We’d been doing this for about ten years at that point, and it was kind of the same crowd of people. I thought to create an outreach game as a total wild-ass experiment to try to bring in people from other parts of the gaming world. I didn’t know whether it would work, but I figured it was worth a try. So I designed a game specifically for that purpose, built around explaining how traditional interactive fiction worked to people who didn’t know how to play it. That meant doing some wacky stuff. There are some rooms in The Dreamhold that you enter by going north, but to go back you have to go east, because I figured, this is really uncomfortable, but people are going to run into this if they get into IF, so they should be familiar with the concept. I’ll try to introduce it as smoothly as possible by putting messages like, “The corridor turns as you head to the north.” Then put in the [room] description, “You can go back the way you came, toward the east,” to try to make it more tangible. But I wanted to introduce complicated maps and darkness and all of the hardcore stuff that the community was used to. And also make it fun. There were a number of these outreach efforts at the time. Some people were taking IF games to more conventional game jams. There were cheat sheets of “how to play IF” going around. My impression is that these efforts weren’t super successful. Is that your impression as well? Yes, it is. None of it actually worked. It’s great that we made the on-ramps and it’s good that we still maintain them, but there was not a huge influx of new people coming onto the scene at that point. My impression is that the community didn’t really start to grow until it opened itself up to non-parser-driven games: the Twine games and ChoiceScript games and so on. Presumably some percentage of those players became willing to try the parser games as well. Yeah, but that was a little bit later, after 2010 or so. There was still a gap. I decided, well, The Dreamhold didn’t make an impact, so I’m just going to go back to writing wacky puzzle games. Of course, in 2007 Inform 7 came out. I would say that drew people into creating games, because it was much more approachable for people who were not C programmers. There was a bit of a revolution there. It was just harder to see because it was new authors rather than new players. The time around 2010 was an exciting one for you personally as well as the community. In addition to the ongoing buzz about Inform 7, Jason Scott released his Get Lamp documentary, and you launched a Kickstarter to make a game called Hadean Lands soon after. Yes. In 2010, Jason Scott premiered Get Lamp at PAX East. He had interviewed me two or three years earlier — probably in 2007. Yeah, he worked on that movie for almost ten years. Exactly. It’s kind of funny to look back at 2007 and see me talking about releasing commercial interactive fiction. But in 2010, all of the old Infocom guys showed up at PAX East. I was on that panel, sitting with Dave Lebling, Brian Moriarty, and Steve Meretzky. I was going… [genuflecting] PAX East, 2010. From left: Dave Lebling, Don Woods, Brian Moriarty, Andrew Plotkin, Nick Montfort, Steve Meretzky, and Jason Scott. (Photo by Eric Havir.) I’m not worthy! Exactly. Jason Scott brought Get Lamp to a game class at Tufts University a few weeks later. Since I was living about half a mile away, I came in and said, “Hi, I’m in this movie.” Afterward, I went up to Jason and said, “You know, people are talking about interactive fiction for the first time in fifteen years outside of our little community. Do you think I should do a Kickstarter for a giant IF game?” And Jason looks at me like I’ve got bananas growing out of my ears and says, “Yes, you should!” He’s the most enthusiastic person in the world. Yes. And of course, he’d just done a Kickstarter for the Get Lamp release. This was early for Kickstarter. There had been gaming Kickstarter projects before, but no really gigantic ones. So, getting $30,000 for an IF Kickstarter was kind of a big deal in 2010. So I went to the boss at my day job and said, “Well, I guess this is it for us. I’m quitting.” I knew that $30,000 wasn’t actually going to last me very long, living in Boston. But of course, I’d been in the software industry for decades by this point, so I had a fair amount of savings cushion built up. And I had a pile of Red Hat stock which was worth some money. I could live on it while I found my footing as an indie developer. The Dreamhold had taken me nine months. I thought Hadean Lands would take me a year. Ha! It turned out that writer’s block is a hell of a thing. Hadean Lands kept getting sidelined. I got totally knocked over by the idea of doing a hypertext MUD. I spent a year writing that. That was Seltani, which was hugely popular for about two months in the Myst fan community; I did it as a Myst fan game and presented it at a Myst convention. Everybody loved it. But I wasn’t writing Hadean Lands, and eventually my KickStarter backers started to get upset about that. I did slog through it. I got Hadean Lands done [in 2014]. I don’t feel like the story is hugely successful, but I’m very happy with the puzzle structure and the game layout. As you know as well as I do, there’s a whole checkered history of people trying to monetize IF. A few years ago, Bob Bates of Infocom and Legend fame released Thaumistry. I was a beta-tester on that game. The game was very good, but these things just never work. It’s always a disappointment in the end. Nobody has ever cracked that code. If you look at the Thaumistry Kickstarter and the Hadean Lands Kickstarter, you see that they made almost the same amount of money from almost the same number of backers. It’s the same crowd showing up: “Yeah, we still love ya!” But they’re not enough to make a living from… The problem is getting outside of that crowd. It’s no wonder that people like Emily Short have long since decamped, saying, “I have to work on different kinds of games with a larger reach.” What about you? Do you think you will ever return to parser-based interactive fiction? That’s a fair question. I’ve had a lot of starts toward things that I thought might be interesting. I started working on a framework for a kind of text game that’s not parser-based but also not hypertext in the sense that Twine is. It’s more combinatoric. I got two-thirds of the way done with building the engine and one-third of the way done with writing a game, then I kind of lost it. But I still think it’s interesting and I might go back to it. I don’t think it would go big the way Twine did, but it might reach a different audience. It’s a different way of thinking about the game structure. Would you care to talk about your partnership with Jason Shiga to turn his interactive comic books into digital apps? I have played Meanwhile, the first of those. Sure. I’d been aware of Jason Shiga ever since I started hanging out with Nick Montfort at MIT after I moved to Boston. Nick had a bunch of his early self-published stuff. He had the original printing of Meanwhile, as a black-and-white hand-cut book. I thought it was really neat. Totally by coincidence, Meanwhile got picked up by a publisher just before that 2010 PAX East we talked about. A nice big hardback version of it was published. It was being sold at PAX East. I thought, man, this is great, I’d really love to do an iPhone version. This was 2010; iPhone games were big. A little later, I did the Hadean Lands Kickstarter and quit my job. I needed to have more projects than just one text adventure, so I wrote to Jason Shiga and said, “Hey, I’m a big fan. I’d love to do an app version of your book.” Jason was amenable, so we had the usual conversations with lawyers and agents and signed a contract. I worked on that at the same time that I was planning out Hadean Lands. The iPhone app came out in 2011. So, the finances of making a go of it as an independent creator of digital content without a day job didn’t quite pan out for you in the end. I feel your pain, believe me. It’s a hard row to hoe. What came next? After Meanwhile and Hadean Lands, I felt very stuck. Jason [Shiga] was off working on non-interactive comics, so there wasn’t anything to do there. I bummed around for a while trying to find something that would make any kind of money at all, but I was not successful. I’m skipping over huge chunks of time here, but in 2017 Emily Short and Aaron Reed were working on a project to do NPC dialog as a commercial product. It was essentially taking Emily’s old ideas about threaded dialog in parser games and turning them into a plugin which game designers could use in any game to have interesting multi-threaded conversations. I spent a couple of years working on that project with them. But it turned out that management at that company sucked and everybody bailed. Since then until this year, I’ve been working for big and small games studios, working on the dialog parts of their games. Coding dialog engines or writing dialog? I’ve been a software engineer, working on the coding part, but working with the writers. Also during this period, Jason Shiga started writing what he calls “Adventuregame Comics,” which are shorter Meanwhile-style books. I’ve started porting those. The Steam port of The Beyond and the iOS and Steam port of Leviathan are available now. The iOS port of The Beyond will be coming later. Since Hadean Lands, you’ve stepped into more of an organizing role in the IF community. Yes. I’m very proud to have transitioned from being a hotshot game writer to someone who is doing community support, building structures and traditions and conferences. I never wanted to be a person who was only famous for writing games, especially after I started writing fewer games. I really didn’t want to be a person who was famous for having been a big game writer in the 1990s. That’s a sucky position to be stuck in. There needs to be a second act. It’s maybe a maturation process as well. When you get a little bit older, you realize that some things are important in a way you may not have when you were a young, hotshot game writer. Yeah. I slowed down writing games because I started to second-guess myself too much. When you’ve written a lot of games that people got really excited about… Then you’re competing with your own back catalog. It doesn’t feel good. I’ve had trouble getting away from that. You’ve done most of your organizational work in the context of the Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation, so maybe we should talk about that more specifically. I’ll give you my impression of the reasons for its founding, and you can tell me if I’m right. You and some other people decided it would be wise to institutionalize things a little bit more, so that the community is no longer so dependent on individuals who come and go. With a foundation and a funding model and all of these institutional aspects, hopefully you set up the community for the long haul, so that it can survive if a server goes down or someone goes away. Yeah, that’s exactly where it started. We’d been running for decades on people just setting up a server somewhere and saying, “Hey, I’ll run this thing!” That was the original IF Archive, the Usenet newsgroups, IF Comp, the Interactive Fiction Database, the IF Forum. It was workable, but everything was being paid out of somebody’s pocket. There wasn’t a lot of discussion about who was doing what or how much it cost. There was no fallback plan and no thinking about what would come next if somebody stopped doing something. Like, there was a long period when IFDB wasn’t getting any updates because Mike Roberts had a day job. Some things about it were clunky and hard to use, but you couldn’t fix them. So, in 2015 or early 2016, Jason McIntosh, who was running the IF Comp at that point, had a conversation with somebody who said, “Why don’t you have a non-profit organization to support the IF Comp? Then you could get donations from people.” And Jason started running around in circles with a gleam in his eye, saying, “Yes! We should do this! We should do this! Whom do I know who can help?” He started talking to other people who were longtime supporters of things in the community. That included Chris Klimas, who had been supporting Twine for three or four years, and me — I’d been supporting the IF Archive for a while. Then Carolyn VanEseltine and Flourish Klink joined. Flourish was the only one who knew how to set up a non-profit. They had run a Harry Potter fan conference as a teenager, and, being excited and not knowing things were hard, had just done it. We got into contact with the same lawyer Flourish had used. The lawyer told us what we needed: forms, bylaws, etc. Jason was the first president, I was the first treasurer. We went down to my bank and opened a business account for the organization. Then we wrote to the IRS to become a 501 C3 non-profit. We set up a website, found someone to give us a basic Web design and a logo. Then we announced it. At the start, we just did the IF Comp; we collected about $8000 that first year for a prize pool. But over the course of the first couple of years, we added Twine and the IF Archive. The IF Forum was the next big addition. Then the IF Wiki and IFDB. Today each has its own steering group. And we have a grants committee now. The NarraScope conference is another IFTF project. Would you like to tell a bit about that? That was my idea. I’d always been keen on the idea of having a narrative-game-oriented conference. I’d been going to GDC for many years. GDC has a sub-track, a narrative-game summit, which is where people like Emily Short and Jon Ingold hang out. But it’s a very tiny slice of what GDC is. And of course GDC is expensive, so it’s hard to bring in the hobbyists and the indie people and the people who write IF Comp games. They just can’t afford GDC. I wanted to provide an alternative that was more approachable and affordable and friendly. Once we as an organization had steady members and contributors and could bring in money, I said, “It’s time to think about a conference. Our first de novo project.” So, I talked to people I knew who had been involved in conferences, like the Myst fan conference, which is a very tiny thing that happens every year, like 100 people. But it’s been going for years and years. And of course Flourish had run a fan conference. In 2017 or 2018, I went to GDC with a bunch of business cards that said, “We want to run an interactive-fiction, adventure, and narrative-oriented game conference. Want to help us?” I handed one to everybody I talked to. I found a bunch of people who were interested in helping. Nick Montfort said he could get us a space at MIT for the event relatively cheap. We put up a call for speakers, a website, etc. We were coordinating with the IFTF Education Committee, which is run by Judith Pintar, who goes all the way back to Shades of Gray. Yeah, I had a great talk with Judith some years ago now. I had strong opinions about how a friendly conference should feel. We had to bring in lunch so people would sit around and have conversations rather than splitting up and running all over Cambridge. I wanted long breaks between talks so people would have space to socially interact. I wanted badges that didn’t distinguish between speakers and attendees; we’re all here, and we’re not going to have superstars. I wanted an open and honest tone. We made sure to have a keynote speaker who wasn’t an old fart. We didn’t want somebody like Scott Adams coming in and talking about what it was like back in the 1980s. You didn’t want to become a retro-gaming conference. Right. And we deliberately made the scope larger than just interactive fiction as found in the IF Comp or the IFDB. We didn’t want to limit the conference to those topics. We kept the admission price down to about $85. That was 2019. We had about 250 people, and everything miraculously went perfectly. The worst disaster was when the Dunkin’ Donuts guy was dropping off coffee and hot cocoa. One of the urns blew its spout and dumped gallons of cocoa all over the floor. Someone said, “I know where there’s a mop,” and went and got the mop and cleaned it up. Great, let’s have the rest of the conference! Local game companies made contributions, maybe $500 or $1000. Between that and the registration fees, the conference broke even. I admit that I threw in $2000 myself to make it balance, but that was because we splurged out and rented a bar on Sunday night. I said, okay, I’ll cover that, so that everybody can go out and have pizza and beer. A dream achieved: Andrew closes the 2019 NarraScope conference in Boston. Time for pizza and beer! It was a huge success. We said we would do it again next year. But of course next year was 2020. You know how that story goes. But it was exciting enough that we wanted to keep going anyway, so we had an online event in 2020. We skipped 2021, then came back in 2022 with an online conference. Then we had a hybrid model for 2023 in Pittsburgh and 2024 in Rochester. And that’s the history of the thing in a nutshell. By now I’ve become just an advisor, which is a great relief. How many people have attended the later conferences? It’s very easy to attend an online conference, so about 500 or 600 people signed up for those. But in person in Pittsburgh, there were about 100, either because people didn’t want to travel in the pandemic era or because we were offering an online option, so a lot of people who could have showed up decided to stay home and watch the stream instead. This year was a little higher, like 120. You were at the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester this year? Yeah. The space was spread out, which turned out to be a win, because we had to walk through the museum and walk past all the cool exhibits. People were jumping out between talks to explore the museum. It was a really neat space — but unfortunately more expensive than a university. And there will be another conference in 2025? There absolutely will. It’s going to be in Philadelphia at Drexel University. NarraScope has not yet become big enough to replace GDC, but we’re optimistic. [smile] I don’t think you want that. It becomes very bureaucratic and soulless. Yeah, obviously. But Justin Bortnick, who is the current IFTF president, has been talking to GDC about booth space to present IFTF on the show floor. The Video Game History Foundation had a booth there this year. We thought, we’re educational too! We could do that! It may actually happen. Maybe we can wind up this conversation by talking about the current status of the IF community itself. For many years, it seemed to be quite stagnant in terms of numbers. We already talked about the outreach efforts that took place around 2005 and largely did not succeed. But about five years later, the hypertext systems started to come online. There was a big jump at that point. If you look at the number of games entered in the Comp, they actually trend down through the 2000s, then suddenly there’s a big spike around 2010 to 2012. They’ve stayed at quite a high level since then. Do you have a sense of whether these new, presumably younger people are jumping over to the parser-based stuff as well? There are new faces on both sides. There is now an active group of retro-fans interested in parser games. That is, people who are excited about making new games and running them on Commodore 64s and the like. We had to update Inform to fix the support for the version 3 Z-Machine, which had been broken over time as everybody was writing bigger and bigger games. Now people want to write small games again. And there is more interest in hybrid systems, intermediate models which are neither pure hypertext nor pure parser. For years and years, there were no new parser tools. I thought the last great parser development systems had already been implemented; people would stick with TADS 3 and Inform 7 forever. Then a parser system called Dialog appeared, which is a little bit different from them. But there is certainly more energy on the hypertext side, especially because a lot of us old farts have drifted away. I’m not writing games anymore, Emily Short isn’t writing text games anymore, Jon Ingold and Aaron Reed went off and did their things, Adam Cadre went off to work on film scripts. There are new people writing new games, but I think the pool is going to shrink over time. But that’s okay. Everything that Jon Ingold has done at Inkle Studios is informed by the early text games he worked on and how he wanted to expand that to reach a bigger audience. Everything Sam Barlow has done — Her Story, Telling L!es, Immortality — is informed by his experience writing text games. The same goes for Emily Short. It’s still part of the conversation. It’s just not the center of it anymore. Yeah. This is a discussion I’ve had from time to time since I started this site. My opinion is that when our generation dies that will probably mark the end of parser-based text adventures. You can say that’s tragic if you want to. At the same time, though, nobody’s writing plays like Shakespeare anymore, but Shakespeare’s plays are still out there. And there’s still theater. Yeah. Trends in interactive media, just the same as others forms of entertainment and art, come and go. They have their time, and then their time is over. I’m quite at peace with that. I’m sort of handicapped by the fact that I haven’t played IF Comp games in quite a while. I haven’t either. To be honest, I’ve played almost nothing made in the last ten years, just because I have so many old games on the syllabus for this site. Having too many games to play is not the worst problem to have, but it’s made me kind of a time traveler. I live in the past in that sense. I do know that this year’s IF Comp winner was by Chandler Groover. I don’t think he’s our age. Ryan Veeder is younger than us. I do look at the Comp website sometimes to see what’s going on. I’ve noticed that it still seems to be a parser-based game that actually wins the thing most of the time. That’s a sign of something, I guess. Yeah. Maybe it’s a sign of old farts hanging on too long? But seriously, I think there is a new generation of parser-game authors. Whether it’s big enough to sustain itself after you and I are doddering in a nursing home, I don’t know. There’s been so much progress with computer understanding of natural language. A lot of it is associated with large language models, of course, which is a fraught subject in itself. But I could imagine a system — a front-end — that could take natural language and translate that into something a traditional parser could more readily understand, then funnel it through even an old text adventure. I’m kind of surprised I haven’t heard of anything like that. Someone did do that as an experiment and posted about it on the forum. Experimenting both with using LLMs on the input side to translate natural language into parserese, and also on the output side to translate generic room descriptions into more flowery, expanded text. I’m more interested in the input side because I like hand-crafted output, but that’s getting into the whole question of AI. Yes, I have no interest whatsoever in reading AI-generated text in any context. I think there wasn’t a lot of uptake on that idea just because the kind of people who are excited about AI aren’t excited about parser games in the first place. There have been several attempts to make an AI-generated text adventure, but they’ve all been by people who were not good at text adventures and didn’t know what they wanted out of it. There’s AI Dungeon, which uses an LLM to pretend to be a parser game. But because it’s all AI generated, it doesn’t really produce anything interesting. The people who are interested in making parser games are mostly old-fashioned artisans who want to hand-craft everything and are not motivated to dive into AI as a shiny new pool. It might be different if someone who was an established parser-game author jumped in and wholeheartedly tried to make it happen. Revolutions are the result of one person getting involved and building something that takes off. Someone has to actually do the work. And to this point, nobody has done that. It’s very possible the whole AI thing will collapse in six months anyway. I think that’s a very good possibility, but I think that if it does, it will leave behind some pieces in the rubble that are actually useful. Maybe a solution to our parsing problems can be one of them. But I’ve kept you long enough. Thanks so much for the talk! Thank you! Did you enjoy this article? If so, please think about pitching in to help me make many more like it. You can pledge any amount you like.

I should say, the cake was the work of my mother, Diane. Full credit there. It was tasty. :) Disco Godfather December 7, 2024 at 5:42 pm Just wanted to comment that cake looked awesome. Moms making birthday cakes is something I miss from that era! Matt Campbell December 6, 2024 at 5:39 pm As soon as I read that Andrew worked for a startup that got acquired by Red Hat, I thought of “Being Andrew Plotkin”, which I played, many years after its release. For some reason, when I played the game, I assumed that it was set at Red Hat simply because that was a company with some nerdy “cool factor” in 2000. Of course, I should have figured that the author would know where Andrew worked and write the game accordingly. It sucks that Red Hat fired Andrew’s team. Andrew Plotkin December 6, 2024 at 5:52 pm Oh, I couldn’t move back to Pittsburgh fast enough. The Raleigh/Durham area was _not_ my home base. (Although, as it happened, Stephen Granade was living in Durham. So we got to hang out for that year.) Anyhow, the pile of Red Hat stock was excellent compensation for my trouble. Jason Dyer December 6, 2024 at 5:44 pm >Yeah. This is a discussion I’ve had from time to time since I started this site.

At the same time, though, nobody’s writing plays like Shakespeare anymore, but Shakespeare’s plays are still out there. Oof. But I don’t disagree, necessarily. We did have radio plays finally come back to life with podcasts, but I still don’t know what will do it with parser fiction. Maybe if a super-famous streamer gets into text adventures. The most prominent streamer I know who is a regular parser player is BillBull (did Gnome Ranger recently) but he’s at the level of 100-150 viewers, not the thousands. I do have two current projects which are text-game adjacent but in the non-disclosure phase, unfortunately. However, they’re along the lines of Ingold etc. where they’re in a slightly more popular slot. I can’t even imagine trying to sell a parser game now, except for maybe getting the Infocom collection from Microsoft and giving it the same treatment Atari and Llamasoft got from Digital Eclipse. The only thing I still find is present in “the youth conversation” is Zork. They know about it. Zork: Grand Inquisitor is one of the official games on the Archipelago randomizer. I sometimes feel like with some of the really obscure games I write about I’m going to be the last one in history who ever plays it, so I try my best to give them all a good showing even if they’re a 30 minute game off a weird tapemag. Matt Campbell December 6, 2024 at 6:05 pm > However, they’re along the lines of Ingold etc. where they’re in a slightly more popular slot. Unfortunately, when I read that, I mentally translate it as “likely not accessible to blind people.” That’s what tends to happen when you take a game that’s text and choice based at its core and wrap it in something like Unity to give it mainstream appeal, as Inkle did. Text-based parser games tend to be accessible by default (in this sense, if not in the wider sense of being approachable to the mainstream), simply because of the constraints of the original medium and the variety of available interpreters (though some interpreters, like Gargoyle, weren’t screen-reader-accessible last time I checked). Yes, yes, I should revive my long-dormant screen reader accessibility plugin for Unity. I presented a proof-of-concept demo at NarraScope 2022 (Andrew happened to be the one who introduced that talk). At this point I’d be happy to hand off the project to someone else who has more familiarity with (and patience for) Unity than I have. Jason Dyer December 6, 2024 at 6:09 pm Nah, we’ve got voice acting. Chandler Groover December 6, 2024 at 10:23 pm >I do know that this year’s IF Comp winner was by Chandler Groover. I don’t think he’s our age. I discovered IF in 2014. It’s not retro to me. It’s contemporary! Eriorg December 7, 2024 at 8:19 pm Of course, in 2007 Inform 7 came out. Actually, it was in 2006 (on April 30). Jerzy December 8, 2024 at 3:48 am Jimmy, thank you for making and posting this interview. Fascinating stuff. Andrew, thanks for all your incredible work over the years! Do you still have a copy of the filesystem-based version of Praser 5? I love your description of it here, and I can imagine mocking up a (much simpler!) version to assign to my undergrad students. Many of them seem genuinely perplexed when I ask where they saved their files for an assignment — “it’s, like, in the cloud?!” — and maybe a praser-5-lite game could help motivate them to learn this stuff. Andrew Plotkin December 8, 2024 at 7:34 pm > Do you still have a copy of the filesystem-based version of Praser 5? I do, but wow, it’s really ancient. I mean it’s written in C, and not even ANSI C — it’s K&R style. I’m not sure it would be a great introduction to the filesystem. I was trying to *subvert* the idea of the filesystem by making it look more like a text adventure. Jerzy December 10, 2024 at 1:54 am That’s too bad but makes sense! I have a friend who likes to say “It subverts the genre to transcend the genre,” which is also a good description of many of your games, but perhaps not the best pedagogical approach for the filesystem newbies I have in mind :-) fform December 8, 2024 at 4:13 am Great interview. Regarding the discussion about AI at the end, while I can’t imagine “AI” (LLMs in this case) producing anything of interest, since it’s all just statistical prediction with no concept of what is actually being said, has anyone actually had an LLM AI play through a game? I’m curious now to know whether an LLM could statistically guess its’ way through a parser-based puzzle. stepped pyramids December 8, 2024 at 4:54 pm I’ve experimented both with using an LLM to solve a parser-based game and using it as a kind of “superparser” to translate natural language human input into commands. Both worked, but I don’t know how useful it is in practice (it’s kind of fun to translate “kiss my butt!” to “say insult to guard”, but I don’t know that it’s worth the latency).

Title: 4 Stocks That Have Surged in 2024 — Are They Really Worth the Investment?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It’s a little hard to believe, but 2024 has been a great year for the stock market. Despite all the conflict and uncertainty around the world, the S&P 500 has notched a 26% gain year-to-date, far outstripping its long-term average annual return of around 10%. Read More: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell Be Aware: Why Skipping a Financial Advisor Could Be Your Biggest Money Mistake Passive investors, who try to replicate the performance of the total market by investing in index funds, have had a great year so far — but there are always some stocks that perform even better than the market average. Most investors who buy individual stocks typically are trying to beat the market and get those outsized returns. When a stock does beat the market, fear of missing out can make it very tempting to invest, but past performance is no guarantee of future success. What has gone up can always come down, so should you buy? Here’s a look at four stocks that have done well in 2024. Trending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move? YTD gain: 44.17% Better known by its former name, Raytheon Technologies, RTX Corporation is the second largest defense contractor in the United States. As a large conglomerate, it is engaged in a variety of businesses that include aerospace products, aircraft engines and missile systems. Given the amount of military aid that the U.S. is currently sending to several conflict zones, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that a defense contractor is doing well. Whether or not that success will continue is unclear. Dr. Peter C. Earle, senior economist with the American Institute for Economic Research, noted that a new presidential administration could have an impact on RTX’s business. “Should the incoming Trump administration follow through on its pledges to force other nations to fend for themselves, the largest publicly traded defense contractors might be poised for a pullback,” Earle said. Verdict: NO Check Out: 3 Undervalued Stocks To Buy Before 2025, According to Experts YTD gain: 83.12% Investors have generally been very well rewarded for holding the stock of retail titan Walmart, and this year has been no exception, as the stock has seen more than double the return of the S&P 500. However, there are some possibly very troubling headwinds that have the potential to make a massive impact on Walmart’s operations. “A cornerstone of the Trump campaign has been tariffs and other forms of trade protectionism. If tariffs of the type which have been discussed are put in place — 60%, 100%, 200%, and so on — retaliatory tariffs would follow. Those could, in turn, devastate companies that rely on imports, [such as] Walmart,” Earle said, citing the fact that Walmart imports many of its goods from Chinese suppliers. Verdict: NO YTD gain: 69.97% Abercrombie & Fitch is a specialty retailer of apparel whose stock has been absolutely surging through 2024. Although down from its mid-year high share price of almost $200, it has still had eye-popping returns for the year so far. Derrick Fung is the CEO of Signals, an investment intelligence platform that tracks consumer spending data to help investors anticipate market movements. His platform’s data indicates a down trend on companies that sell “nice to have” non-durable products — things like higher end cosmetics, apparel and home furnishings. “Our data has been showing a down trend on [ANF] — i.e. we’ve gotten a SELL Signal on all these names in the last 45 days — and the signal has worked on all of them,” Fung said. Verdict: NO YTD gain: 192.98% Chipmaker Nvidia has made a lot of headlines over the last year, as it has skyrocketed to become the second largest company in the world, right behind Apple. Its specialty is in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are highly prized for artificial intelligence applications, and its business has surged along with the wave of hype surrounding generative AI. It’s hard for a business to maintain such a stunning level of growth, so investors may be wondering if it’s time to get off of the rocket. However, for the stock analysts that cover Nvidia, there remains a high degree of enthusiasm for the business. Of the 63 analysts currently making recommendations, 57 of them rate NVDA as a Buy or a Strong Buy. That’s over 90%, and that level of consensus among analysts is often rare.

Title: 5 Stock Buys And Sells From Top Billionaire Investors

Over the past 30 months, the reported moves of billionaire investors were a major consideration in the strategies we have used to construct our two Forbes Billionaire Investor model portfolios, but they were not the only factor. We also sought out stocks that had compelling value appeal with low debt levels and strong business fundamentals, which means stocks trading at depressed valuations that still produce rising revenues and profits. Except for Walt Disney (DIS), which had exceptional interest from activist billionaire investors, we’ve required our stocks to pay dividends. We also wanted to see evidence of recent insider buying among company managers and directors. The strategy has yielded great success. When we launched Forbes Billionaire Investor in September 2022, we bought large-cap future home runs like retail success stories Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS +118%) and Ross Stores (ROST +90%), as well as “Magnificent Seven” member Microsoft (MSFT +84%). Among small- and mid-caps we had F&G Annuities & Life (FG +176%), lighting specialist Acuity Brands (AYI +99%), midstream oil and gas MLP Antero Midstream (AM +97%) and mortgage insurer Radian Group (RDN +96%). Monitoring Moves Of Billionaire Investors Since 1934, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has required investment managers who exercise discretion over at least $100 million worth of assets to report their holdings on a quarterly basis via form 13F. These publicly available documents provide individual investors with a detailed look into the portfolio moves of hedge funds, private equity and other investment funds, but the information arrives with significant delays. Investment managers do not need to report their buys and sells until 45 days after the end of the financial quarter in which they were made. Especially for algorithmic and trading-oriented managers, quants like Ken Griffin of Citadel, Jeffrey Yass of Susquehanna International Group and Israel Englander of Millennium Management, if you were to buy every stock that superstar investors reported in their 13F filings, you could be buying many stocks that they have already sold. Holding periods tend to be longer for value style billionaires like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and David Tepper of Apaloosa Management, who seek out long-term ownership, and for activist investors like Carl Icahn who tend to hold a stock long enough to shake up management teams and companies’ boards of directors. Despite the lag times built into reporting requirements, 13F filings do provide small investors opportunities to identify areas of agreement among investment managers, and they do help you discern rising or falling ownership trends of specific managers. Moves into or out of particular sectors and industry groups become apparent, as do instances of investment conviction in single stocks. For example, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway just reported buying a $600 million stake in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ). Buffett grabbing a slice of the Domino’s pie is one of 25 interesting insights gleaned from looking at the five biggest buys and five biggest sells of the five wealthiest self-made billionaire investors, according to Forbes. With a personal fortune of $147 billion, Buffett is by far the wealthiest, more than triple the net worth of his closest rival, Susquehanna founder Jeffrey Yass, worth nearly $50 billion. Presented below are the largest dollar-volume buys and sells of the world’s wealthiest investment managers taken from their most recent SEC filings. Timothy Archibald/The Forbes Collection From our perspective, it was most encouraging to see Berkshire initiating a $225 million stake in October’s large-cap buy, aerospace and defense supplier Heico (HEI), based in Hollywood, Fla. Buffett joins eight other billionaires in Heico, the largest stake held by Florida billionaire optometrist and inventor Herbert Wertheim, who owns 7.5% of Heico’s outstanding shares. Buffett continues to slash his ownership of Apple and Bank of America although both stocks still represent Berkshire Hathaway’s first and third largest holdings, accounting for a respective 23% and 12% of its investment portfolio. SIG Pennsylvania billionaire Jeffey Yass’ Susquehanna International Group reported selling off 69% of its Apple holdings over the past six months and still held 210,000 shares. Susquehanna also embraced a dour view of the overall market with sales of the SPDR S&P 500 and Invesco QQQ Trust ETFs. Nonetheless, QQQ is still Susquehanna’s second largest holding behind Nvidia, of which it holds 3.4 million shares, up from 2.4 million at the end of 2023. Aaron Kotowski for Forbes Through his majority ownership of financial market making firm Citadel Securities,which is valued at $22 billion,Ken Griffin would be a multi-billionaire even without his Citadel Advisors hedge fund, but it’s only because of his successful fund that he owns the equally successful securities brokerage firm business.Citadel has been taking technology sector profits in Amazon and Microsoft, as well as mobile app company AppLovin. Citadel’s biggest buy, however, was also in tech but from Australia: collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM). It was also an avid buyer of medical implant maker Medtronic (MDT). Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos/Getty Images The biggest buy that New York Mets owner Steven Cohen is now considering is whether he should sign superstar free agent Juan Soto to a several hundred-million dollar deal this offseason. Recently, Cohen’s Point72 hedge fund was both bullish and bearish on broadcasting. It scooped up shares of NBC owner Comcast, shares of which recently got a bump higher after the company floated plans to sell its cable networks, while unloading stock in fellow broadcast and cable stock Fox. Broadcom and Amazon are two big names that Cohen has been selling. Mark Brown/Getty Images Like Cohen, David Tepper is also a professional sports franchise owner with his majority stake in the NFL’s Carolina Panthers. The value of that stake has soared in the past two years even though the team’s on-field performance has continued to underwhelm. Tepper’s Appaloosa hedge fund has been locking in gains of several “Magnificent Seven” stocks, particularly Nvidia, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. Despite President-elect Trump’s anti-China rhetoric the value investor’s biggest buy is from Shanghai: PDD Holdings which owns online marketplace Temu. Another recent China buy from Tepper is JD.com.

Title: Is Microsoft Corporation Inc. (MSFT) Dominating A Billionaire Quant’s Investment Strategy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Dominating a Billionaire Quant's Investment Strategy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. AQR Capital Management is a global investment management firm, founded by Cliff Asness in 1998, dedicated to delivering positive outcomes for its clients. AQR Capital Management has spent over two decades exploring market forces and applying insights to manage client portfolios effectively and has placed itself at the core of economics, behavioral finance, data, and technology. Cliff Asness, a renowned figure in finance, is the Founder, Managing Principal, and Chief Investment Officer at AQR Capital Management. He is recognized for his extensive research and contributions to financial literature with many awards to his name including multiple Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy Awards, Graham and Dodd Awards, and the prestigious 2020 Fama/DFA Prize for Capital Markets and Asset Pricing. Asness' career began at Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he served as Managing Director and Director of Quantitative Research before founding AQR. He actively participates in professional organizations and serves on boards such as The Journal of Portfolio Management, Courant Institute of Mathematical Finance at NYU, Q-Group, and The National WWII Museum. Asness started with a $10 million investment from a small group of investors in 1995 and rapidly expanded the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund using quantitative strategies thereby increasing its assets to over $100 million within months. After Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to establish his own hedge fund, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, reaching assets totaling $12 billion by 2007. Asness, a former doctoral student under Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, saw shifts in market efficiency over his career, through meme stocks and valuation disparities post-pandemic. He believes there's ongoing potential in value investing, as opposed to less than three years ago when opportunities were more noticeable. AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, operates as a hedge fund managing discretionary assets valued at $119.9 billion as of August 2023, according to their Form ADV filing. Their latest 13F filing for Q2 2023 disclosed a portfolio value $48.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.42%. AQR manages around $8 billion of its total $99 billion assets under management in an emerging-market equities portfolio, employing a collaborative approach similar to its other funds. This strategy, which diversifies away from the dominance of US stocks, positions AQR alongside industry leaders like Morgan Stanley Investment Management. AQR's multi-strategy offerings achieved a 13.5% gain year-to-date through April 2024, following a 16% return in 2023. As global interest rates remain elevated, creating opportunities for hedge funds, AQR's futures-trading strategies have thrived amidst market volatility. AQR Capital Management is gradually integrating machine-driven strategies aiming to enhance performance and adapt to market dynamics. Despite initial skepticism towards machine learning in investing, AQR has expanded into trend-following strategies, including tracking fundamental signals and venturing into niche markets such as Malaysian palm oil and milk. Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York, Asness emphasised that recent improvements in the firm's performance reflect not only market cycles but also strategic adjustments. "We let the machine decide more," Asness emphasized, noting his confidence in machine-based decision-making over human intuition. Our Methodology: Stocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe. A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Position size: $1.73 billion Activity: 5% Microsoft (MSFT) was the #1 position in AQR's portfolio at the end of the first quarter. Here is what we said six months ago: Analysts from Wolfe Research and Barclays believe that Microsoft Corporation Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) is well-positioned amid expected market volatility, emphasizing its resilience and investor appeal. MSFT has seen significant share price gains by 30% over the past one year. Following which multiple Wall Street analysts support bullish sentiments in addition to New Street Research that gave the Company a new Buy rating with a $570 price target. The company's strategic integration of AI in its Cloud division has driven impressive growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment. Microsoft's investments in its Search business, Bing, have also generated market share gains. Looking ahead, analysts anticipate continued earnings growth for MSFT, making its current valuation, with a forward P/E ratio of 31, attractive." At the time AQR had $1.67 billion invested in the stock and MSFT shares were trading at $421. MSFT stock only returned 5% since then and it isn't the top position in AQR's portfolio anymore. Overall, AQR owns only 0.05% of MSFT's outstanding shares. This may be a top 3 position for AQR but relatively AQR isn't too bullish on the stock. Overall MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks that are dominating a billionaire quant's investment strategy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The head of a $210 billion asset management firm has decided to unload a massive pile of assets. Billionaire Israel “Izzy” Englander, CEO of Millennium Management, has sold off 68% of the firm’s Walmart (WMRT) position – 8.1 million shares worth about $745 million – according to its latest filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to data compiled by TickerTracker, Millennium has also significantly decreased its holdings of Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN). In total, the shares sold by Millennium Management in Q3 amount to more than $20 billion. Meanwhile, Englander has reportedly increased the firm’s exposure to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBTC) as well as Microsoft (MSFT) and Spotify (SPOT). Englander is also shifting his focus in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, selling 95% of the firm’s shares in Rivian (RIVN) to get into the electric air flying taxi company Archer Aviation (ACHR), a favorite of ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood. Englander acquired 3,247,428 shares of the company, while Wood has been accumulating ACHR since August of 2023. ACHR is down 53% from its all-time high of $18.49 but up over 204% in the last month alone. Millenium Management has recorded 162% gains over the last four years. Other billionaire portfolio shakeups reported recently include Bill Ackman’s recent accumulation of asset manager Brookfield Corporation and apparel giant Nike, and Ken Fisher’s $800,000,000 bet on the US banking industry with his purchase of JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

Title: Warren Buffett once called an investment a ‘terrible long-term asset’ — but he’s holding $325B of it today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Warren Buffett has never shied away from calling out underperforming investments. Among his most scathing critiques? An asset virtually everyone owns — cash. Accredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger — and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here’s how Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But less than 2 minutes can save you more than $600/year These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how In a 2008 op-ed for The New York Times, Buffett warned, “Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn’t. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value.” Buffett had a point. Interest rates were low in 2008, so cash didn’t pay much. Meanwhile, inflation steadily eroded the purchasing power of money, diminishing cash's real value over time. Fast forward to today, and the story seems to have taken an unexpected turn. By the end of Q3 2024, Berkshire Hathaway’s cash reserves had swelled to a staggering $325.2 billion. The sheer size of Buffett’s cash pile has raised eyebrows and fueled speculation about his strategy. Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan told Reuters that the growing cash reserve “begs questions about whether Buffett thinks stocks are overvalued or an economic downturn is coming, or is trying to build cash for a big acquisition.” Similarly, CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert interpreted Berkshire’s cash hoarding as signaling a "risk-off" mindset, according to the report, which could lead investors to worry about its implications for the economy and markets. Buffett himself has addressed concerns about his cash strategy, explaining his cautious approach during Berkshire’s annual shareholders meeting earlier this year. “I don't think anybody sitting at this table has any idea of how to use it effectively, and therefore we don't use it,” he stated, emphasizing that “we only swing at pitches we like.” Buffett has also voiced concerns about future complexities, noting, “As the world gets more sophisticated, complicated and intertwined, more can go wrong.” He added that the company aims to be prepared to “act when that happens.” While Buffett is holding a massive cash pile, his warning about its drawbacks remains relevant. Inflation continues to chip away at the purchasing power of your hard-earned money. Putting your money to work not only helps you grow your wealth but also shields it from inflation’s long-term erosive effects. Read more: Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe — you may want to do the same in 2024 Here are three popular ways to make your cash work harder: As one of the most successful investors, Buffett built his fortune on investing in equities — particularly U.S. stocks. In his 2016 letter to shareholders, he expressed unwavering confidence in American businesses: “American business – and consequently a basket of stocks – is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead.” Berkshire’s performance serves as a powerful testament to that principle. From 1964 to 2023, the company delivered an astonishing overall gain of 4,384,748%. While Buffett is legendary for picking winning companies, he’s an even bigger advocate for a simpler, tried-and-true strategy: investing in an S&P 500 index fund. “In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,” he famously stated. This straightforward approach gives investors exposure to 500 of America’s largest companies across various industries, providing diversified exposure without the need for constant monitoring or active trading. Following this strategy has never been easier. Today, a variety of apps allow you to invest in index funds like the S&P 500 seamlessly — some will even round up spare change from everyday purchases to build your portfolio. It’s a low-effort, high-impact way to grow your wealth over time. Real estate has long been considered a reliable hedge against inflation, thanks to its intrinsic value and income-generating potential. When inflation rises, property values often increase as well, reflecting the higher costs of materials, labor and land. At the same time, rental income tends to go up, providing landlords with a revenue stream that adjusts for inflation. This combination makes real estate an attractive option for preserving and growing wealth during periods of escalating price levels. In 2022, Buffett stated that if you offered him “1% of all the apartment houses in the country” for $25 billion, he would “write you a check.” Whether the economy is booming or in a recession, people need a place to live. And with real estate prices rising to unaffordable levels in many parts of the country, renting has become the only option for many people. These days, you don’t need to purchase a property outright to invest in real estate. REITs are a popular choice for those looking to gain exposure to this essential market. Companies like American Homes 4 Rent (AMH) focus on single-family rental homes, while Equity Residential (EQR) targets multifamily housing in high-demand urban areas. These companies can serve as a starting point for further research. Meanwhile, crowdfunding platforms allow everyday investors to own shares in rental properties without the large down payments or management headaches traditionally associated with real estate ownership. Before you invest, make sure you understand all the risks of real estate crowdfunding. Keep in mind, there’s no guarantee of receiving rental income deposits from your investment and your money will be locked up until the property is sold, so there’s no liquidity. Gold is another popular hedge against inflation. The reason is straightforward: the yellow metal can’t be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks like fiat money. And because its value isn’t tied to any one currency or economy, gold could provide protection during periods of economic uncertainty. This unique characteristic has earned it the reputation of being a “safe haven” asset. When inflation erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies, gold's appeal as a stable store of value often grows, driving up demand. Investors have already taken note of its resilience. So far in 2024, gold prices have surged by 27%, surpassing $2,600 per ounce. Economist Peter Schiff sees substantial further upside for gold. “If gold can go from $20 an ounce to $2,600 an ounce, it can go from $2,600 to $26,000, or even to $100,000. There’s no limit because, again, gold isn’t changing — it’s the value of the dollar that’s decreasing,” he recently stated. There are multiple ways to invest in gold. Car insurance in America now costs a stunning $2,329/year on average — but here’s how 2 minutes can save you more than $600 in 2025 I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 3 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord.

Title: Trying new social media tactics to stand out in ‘brutal’ job market

From cash rewards to “desperate” banners, more job seekers are getting creative to land their next employment. SAN FRANCISCO — Job hunting for Nadeera Waduwara Kankanamalage has been nothing short of frustrating over the past two years. So a week before Thanksgiving, the 32-year-old Austin resident took an unlikely approach to landing a new tech gig: He went on LinkedIn offering a $3,000 reward to anyone who connects him to his next job. Kankanamalage’s written plea in his post sums up what many job seekers are experiencing right now: The market is “brutal” and the number of rejections are “a gut punch.” “It’s a whatever-it-takes mentality,” he said in an interview with the Washington Post. “Hopefully it’s a good signal for a potential employer that I’m proactive, and I’m trying to solve this problem in a creative way.” Exasperated by too much competition, no return communications, and automated rejection letters, job seekers are getting creative on social media to get a foot in the door. Many of them have spent months looking for roles, applying to hundreds of openings and turning to social media with seemingly nothing to lose. Some are offering rewards for job leads, tagging employers in their posts in the hopes of getting a comment, and getting vulnerable with videos and banners that say they are “desperate” for work. Their approaches represent a marked shift from how people used to handle layoffs and employment. That shift “might be a by-product of people’s greater willingness to be open,” said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School. “Not too long ago, people would’ve been mortified to say they were open to work.” Kankanamalage said he is trying different things to see “what sticks.” “I need to be creative in getting myself into the workforce again,” he said. While more people are using social media networks to amplify their job hunt, unemployment remains relatively low in the United States at 4.1 percent, just above the 54-year record low last year of 3.4%, according to the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The strong labor market is expected to continue into next year under the new presidential administration, House predicts. Despite the strong labor market, some industries are experiencing substantial churn as they reconfigure their workforce to address evolving business needs like artificial intelligence, he added. The share of people who have been unemployed for six months or more is increasing, while many workers may be less likely to relocate due to low mortgage rates that they scored during the pandemic, he said. Some job seekers have taken to TikTok, shedding tears as they explain their layoffs and ask for help. Others are making creative videos to show their skills, or producing video resumés. Then there’s the multitude of people who are making their case on the professional networking platform LinkedIn. Laura Martyna, a recruiting and human resources professional, created a mini marketing campaign for herself on LinkedIn after being laid off in September. Even though the 43-year-old in Concord, N.C., has more than 15 years of experience, including at Amazon, she said she’s only landed two interviews out of hundreds of job applications. When her dream job at Eli Lilly opened, she listed the reasons the company should hire her. She tagged the company, as well as former colleagues and bosses, whom she asked to add comments to support her effort. She also tagged the hiring manager, who responded with appreciation for the enthusiasm. “I don’t know how else to get flashing lights to get attention,” Martyna said the day after she posted. “It’s worth a shot. Nothing else is working.” Days later, Martyna got an automated rejection letter. But shortly after, the hiring manager asked to set up a meeting to learn more about her. For Martyna, the post paid off. Other job seekers have tried to cast wide nets by using banners that border their LinkedIn profile pictures with the phrase Open to Work. It’s one of the most common banners used, but some who’ve added it complain that it lures scams and bots. As an alternative, some LinkedIn members created their own banners using words like motivated or excited instead. One banner, made by a designer out of Britain, briefly went viral a couple of months ago. It pulled no punches with one blunt word: desperate. Jordan Dye, a 27-year-old, who’s been trying to break into the cybersecurity industry, added it to his profile immediately after seeing it. “I saw an opportunity, took it and then it blew up way bigger than I thought,” said the Dallas resident, who previously had relatively few LinkedIn connections. “I have over 1,600 followers now.” Dye said his post explaining the banner got about a half-million views, connections, and a lot of discussion. But he didn’t hear from hiring managers. He later changed his banner to Dying, playing off his name and the widespread desperation in the market. Dye, who for now isn’t using either banner, estimated he’s applied to 4,500 jobs since June 2023. Another job seeker, Rita Williams, initially used the banner in solidarity with the “desperate” movement. But the 38-year-old, who’s seeking a job as a technical analyst for a social justice reform organization, still displays it after two months, eight interviews, and 500 applications. “It seems like it became an indicator of, ‘Wow this person has been through it,’” she said about the banner. “It generates interest, and people are kinder.” She said she’s also in the process of creating a nonprofit. “Desperate times call for desperate measures,” she said. LinkedIn said people who use the Open to Work banner on average are 40% more likely to receive messages from recruiters and 20% more likely to receive messages from other members. To avoid scams, LinkedIn said job seekers should look for verification badges on job postings and profiles. Given LinkedIn’s easy-apply button, and generative AI, which can quickly tailor a resumé for a specific job, employers and recruiters are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of candidates. But two recruiters were mixed on whether social media posts are a reliable way to stand out in the candidate pool. “Some of them are entertaining, but I don’t know if I’d hire based off that,” said Mindy Totaro, a senior creative recruiter at staffing agency Aquent. “Do you understand the skills or is it about just trying to get someone to respond?” Instead, Totaro says job seekers should focus on building relationships with recruiters and hiring managers, even if they don’t pay off right away, and ensure that their resumé skills match the job. It’s also best to be among the first applicants because recruiters sometimes have just 24 hours to present top candidates. To see job postings faster, follow recruiters and employers on social media, she said. But Thomas Vick, a technology employment trends expert and regional president with recruiting firm Robert Half, said creative posts — when done right — may give job seekers a leg up. “Anything that differentiates you in a positive, productive manner, especially if you can highlight how it can be beneficial to the business … it certainly can help,” he said, adding that candidates should try to stand out. Some job seekers exhausted by the void of silence and repeated rejections are becoming brutally honest. Feeling invisible after hundreds of applications, Chuck Williams let his LinkedIn network know that he’s on the verge of losing his house. Williams, a 36-year-old husband and father of two in Richland, Wash., said he was laid off just two months after purchasing the house. Six months later, he made his vulnerable LinkedIn plea for leads. “I genuinely needed to be honest about where I’m at and what I feel,” he said. Since the post, he’s received at least 3,000 comments and messages, mostly from people facing similar struggles. The post hasn’t led to a job, but it did land him two interviews with hiring managers. The outpouring of support that came from that post taught Williams a lesson: “There isn’t a silver bullet here. But what I think resonates with people is honesty.”

Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to ... [+] relieve all worry about a softening labor market. The November jobs report on Friday was solid but had enough question marks to keep the door wide open to a Federal Reserve rate cut on December 18. Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to relieve all worry about a softening labor market. Any concerns about the short-term fate of the economy remain misplaced, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 3.3% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 227,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. The October data was revised upward by 36,000. The household survey data was soft, with a loss of 355,000 jobs, but the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 117,000. Monthly Job Growth Wages held steady at 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.9%. The average workweek hours rose to 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Hours Worked & Wages The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. However, both series are above early-year levels, indicating some softening in the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Sahm Rule: U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The two-month decline in the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved sharply higher. Economically and regulatorily sensitive bank stocks have been robust since the U.S. Presidential election. Market Returns Stocks and other risk assets have been on the rise since election day. In addition to the resilient economy, the bullish story is bolstered by the fact that December is seasonally one of the top-returning months of the year. 3 Top Months For The S&P 500 Since 1950 Less helpful for the intermediate-term outlook for stocks is the more bullish than average investor sentiment. While not at extreme levels yet, it is at a place where we have seen pullbacks in the past. Investor Sentiment Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated despite some of the cracks in the jobs report, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. Cyclicals Versus Defensives A crucial economic report before the next Federal Reserve meeting on December 18 includes Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) report. Consensus estimates expect November CPI to rise to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the December meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by raising the odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the December Fed meeting. Barring a surprise in economic data, investors should anticipate another rate cut at the meeting. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While solid, the Friday job report had enough question marks to cause the Federal Reserve to want some insurance against the downside in the labor market and economy by cutting short-term rates at the upcoming December meeting. Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be crucial in leaving the door open to the rate cut. Meanwhile, stocks and other risk assets continue to paint a rosy picture of the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits.

However, both series are above early-year levels, indicating some softening in the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Sahm Rule: U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The two-month decline in the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved sharply higher. Economically and regulatorily sensitive bank stocks have been robust since the U.S. Presidential election. Market Returns Stocks and other risk assets have been on the rise since election day. In addition to the resilient economy, the bullish story is bolstered by the fact that December is seasonally one of the top-returning months of the year. 3 Top Months For The S&P 500 Since 1950 Less helpful for the intermediate-term outlook for stocks is the more bullish than average investor sentiment. While not at extreme levels yet, it is at a place where we have seen pullbacks in the past. Investor Sentiment Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated despite some of the cracks in the jobs report, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. Cyclicals Versus Defensives A crucial economic report before the next Federal Reserve meeting on December 18 includes Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) report. Consensus estimates expect November CPI to rise to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the December meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by raising the odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the December Fed meeting. Barring a surprise in economic data, investors should anticipate another rate cut at the meeting. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While solid, the Friday job report had enough question marks to cause the Federal Reserve to want some insurance against the downside in the labor market and economy by cutting short-term rates at the upcoming December meeting. Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be crucial in leaving the door open to the rate cut. Meanwhile, stocks and other risk assets continue to paint a rosy picture of the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks that investors probably missed. AI is increasingly shaping diverse industries, from healthcare and website design to cybersecurity. Companies are utilizing traditional AI and generative models to improve diagnostics, customer experiences, and business efficiency. While AI offers immense benefits, it also presents new challenges, especially in securing sensitive data. As businesses continue to innovate with AI, balancing its advantages and potential risks will be crucial for future growth. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December. At the CNBC CFO Council Summit on December 4, Squarespace’s Nathan Gooden, Zoetis’s Wetteny Joseph, and Varonis’s Guy Melamed shared their insights on how artificial intelligence is being integrated into their businesses. From animal health and website development to cybersecurity, these executives discussed the ways AI is improving their operations, improving customer experiences, and addressing emerging challenges. They also explored the evolving role of generative AI and its potential impact on the future of their industries. Wetteny Joseph discussed how AI is being used in animal health, noting the integration of traditional AI in diagnostic platforms for animals, such as a system that quickly analyzes slide images to identify health issues, with potential to expand into human healthcare. Nathan Gooden highlighted the long-standing use of machine learning in the platform, and the incorporation of generative AI to simplify the website design process for customers. Guy Melamed mentioned AI’s dual impact: improving customer protection while also presenting risks, such as exposing sensitive data via AI tools like co-pilot. His company focuses on securing data and preventing unauthorized access through these AI systems. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures and sells integrated circuits and semiconductor devices, offering various fabrication processes. Its products are used in industries like high-performance computing, smartphones, automotive, and consumer electronics. According to a report by Reuters, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is in talks with Nvidia to produce its Blackwell AI chips at TSMC's Arizona facility, which is set to begin volume production in 2025. The chips, currently made in Taiwan, are in high demand for generative AI and computing tasks. While the Arizona plant will handle the chips' front-end process, packaging will still take place in Taiwan due to the absence of CoWoS technology in the U.S. facility. Taiwan Semiconductor’s (NYSE:TSM) Arizona plant already serves customers like Apple and AMD. This expansion is part of TSMC's significant investment in Phoenix, supported by U.S. government subsidies to boost domestic chip production. Overall TSM ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Trump’s favourite index is tipped to rally further in 2025. But will he get in the way?

Donald Trump’s vetting of cabinet picks second time round may have thrown up some blunders, with his nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) this week following the fate of Matt Gaetz’s short-lived candidacy for attorney general. Chad Chronister, currently a Florida sheriff, withdrew his name to run the DEA from consideration – though Trump says he pulled the plug – on Wednesday as a result of uproar among Republicans over his arrest of a pastor in 2020 for holding large services during a Covid lockdown. It follows Gaetz withdrawing his name for lawyer-in-chief last month amid allegations of sexual misconduct. However, the band Trump is putting together elsewhere – including hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent being picked as treasury secretary, oil industry veteran Chris Wright as energy secretary, stockbroking firm Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary, and Paul Atkins, a free marketeer and crypto-friendly lawyer, as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission – has been warmly received at a constituency close to his heart: Wall Street. The stock market, as we learned during Trump’s first term in office, is Trump’s favoured barometer of success – having regularly peppered speeches back then with the question, “How’s your 401(K) doing?” That referred to the stock-laden retirement savings vehicles used by more than 100 million Americans. New York’s S&P 500 index of blue-chip US companies, the world’s most widely followed equities index, has advanced almost 5.5 per cent since Trump outflanked Kamala Harris just over a month ago – bringing its advance so far this year to 28 per cent, and to an all-time high. Investors have committed almost $140 billion (€132.3 billion) of fresh money to US equity funds since the election, with November being the busiest month for inflows on records stretching back to 2000, on hopes the incoming administration will unleash sweeping tax cuts and reforms to help corporate America, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing figures from market data provider EPFR. The S&P 500, which has a major influence on stock markets globally, is on track to reach 6,500 points by the end of next year, according to median forecast of 48 equity strategists recently polled by Reuters. That points to about a 7 per cent advance from current levels. Former Iseq heavyweights CRH and Flutter Entertainment have quit the Irish market in the past 15 months and moved their main listings to the US with an aim of ultimately joining the S&P 500. Smurfit Kappa secured direct entry to the index in July when it merged with a US cardboard box-making rival to form Smurfit Westrock. But never has the US market been dominated by so few. The so-called magnificent seven group of high-performing stocks – including Nvidia, the maker of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) computer chips, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Amazon – have driven the broader market higher in 2024. Nvidia’s 200 per cent surge alone has fuelled a fifth of the S&P 500’s gain this year. And the seven are seen leading the way again in 2025, according to strategists. There’s a lot of hope priced into equities right now. But investors don’t have to look too far to see red flags. Following this year’s rally, companies on the S&P 500 are trading at an average of 23 times expected earnings, according to stock market research firm Birinyi Associates. That’s well over the 10-year average of about 18. Tech valuations are even more stretched. Joe Davis, chief economist of Vanguard, the world’s second-largest manager, warned this week that the market had overestimated the short-term potential of AI technology, increasing the risk of a price “correction”. He said some tech valuations were approaching those of 1997 – referring to the tech bubble era. While JP Morgan strategists were upbeat on equities in their 2025 market outlook, published this week, as central banks continue to ease interest rates and the new US administration embarks on a programme of deregulation, they warned of a risk of “disruptive Trump policies triggering a crash landing”. Historically high prices for US housing, crypto currencies (Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Thursday) and gold, as well as low corporate bond market interest rates, relative to risk, broaden the potential fallout. The Central Bank of Ireland highlighted in a report this week that there is a “widening disconnect” between economic uncertainty – also stemming from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, and fears about a possible US-China clash over Taiwan – and current low volatility in global equity and debt markets. This increases the chances of a “sharp repricing of assets”, it warned. Trump 2.0, with a return of “America first”, has already seen the president-elect suggest universal tariffs on all goods imported to the US and sharply higher levies on Chinese goods. He has also threatened neighbouring Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent taxes on goods from both unless they stem immigration to the US and flows of drugs. Economists have said tariffs will be inflationary and force the US Federal Reserve to reverse course on its current cycle of easing interest rates. “The effects would be inflationary in the short term – with companies facing higher input costs and consumers paying more for finished goods; [and be] a drag on US GDP in the medium term, while underpinning still-high benchmark interest rates,” said S&P Global Ratings. GDP stands for gross domestic product. Inflation could also be stoked if mass deportations of illegal immigrants kick in – or people start self-deporting in droves – under Trump. Fewer workers in some industries could put upward pressure on wages. Stock market bulls argue Trump will be quick to change course on any economically disruptive policies if they lead to a stock market sell-off. But that won’t prevent volatility in the meantime. And incoming cabinet members should know from the experience of the walking wounded from Trump’s first administration, he’ll always find someone else to blame.

Title: How Much ‘Magnificent 7’ Companies Spend on Protecting Their CEOs

Time Published: 2024-12-06T22:53:29Z

The shocking killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson this week has shined a light on the security concerns facing corporate leaders and the myriad expenses their companies pay to protect them. Meta (META), for example, shells out a staggering $24.4 million every year on personal security and travel for its CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives. Such costs are appropriate and necessary “in light of the threat landscape,” said the company in its most recent proxy statement. Tesla (TSLA), too, spends millions on security for its CEO Elon Musk, who in recent years has become increasingly concerned about attacks on his wellbeing. The EV maker spent $2.4 million last year to hire a security company for its billionaire leader. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Thompson, who was murdered earlier this week in New York City, headed an insurance subsidiary of UnitedHealth. The parent company didn’t break out any details regarding executive security perks in its 2023 proxy statement, although it noted that UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty is required to use corporate aircraft during business travel for security reasons. Security costs across S&P 500 companies have risen substantially in recent years, according to data from Equilar, an executive data compensation research firm. The median value of security expense perks doubled from $47,643 in 2021 to $98,069 by 2023, with the share of companies providing such arrangements for named executive officers increasing by 23.5 percent to 27.5 percent. Here’s a look at what some of the world’s largest tech companies spend on security expenses for their top executives: Meta, the highest S&P 500 spender on executive security perquisites, spent most of its security-related $24.4 million expenses in 2023 on CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He received $9.4 million in costs related to personal security at his residences and during personal travel, in addition to a pre-tax allowance of $14 million to cover additional personal security costs for Zuckerberg and his family. Meta also paid for security for a handful of other of other executives, including $903,139 for chief operating officer Javier Olivan. In 2023, Google (GOOGL)’s parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) spent almost $6.8 million on personal security services for Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet. This makes the tech company the second biggest S&P 500 spender for the year on security perk expenditures, according to Equilar. Amazon (AMZN) spent a grand total of nearly $2.7 million in 2023 on security arrangements for executives including Jeff Bezos, Andy Jassy, Douglas Herrington and Adam Selipsky. Security costs totaled at $1.6 million for Bezos, the company’s founder and executive chair, and $986,164 for CEO Jassy. The company also spent $22,631 on security for Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, and $51,636 on Selipsky, CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Nvidia (NVDA) shelled out nearly $2.5 million in fiscal 2024 for its CEO Jensen Huang. These costs included $2.2 million residential security and consultation fees for Huang, in addition to security monitoring services and car and driver services. Apple (AAPL) spent around $820,000 last year on personal security services for its CEO Tim Cook. The company also spent more than $1.6 million on air travel expenses for Cook, a fee that included hourly flight charges, fuel charges, departure fees and landing fees. Due to Apple’s “global profile” and “the highly visible nature of Mr. Cook’s role as CEO,” Cook is required to use private aircrafts for all business and personal travel. In December 2023, Tesla paid a security company owned by its CEO Elon Musk to provide services to Musk himself. These expenses totaled $2.4 million in 2023 and around $500,000 through February of this year, according to Tesla’s filings. Musk in July said in a post on his social platform X that two separate people had tried to kill him in the past eight months before they were arrested. In fiscal year 2024, Microsoft (MSFT) put $58,291 towards security-related costs and personal travel expenses for its CEO Satya Nadella. Providing such security services enables top executives “to focus on their duties to Microsoft while reducing security threats, and therefore, mitigate risks to our business,” said the company in a recent filing.

Title: What Arm’s CEO makes of the Intel debacle

Time Published: 2024-12-06T21:45:26Z

By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Arm CEO Rene Haas has a unique, bird’s eye view of the tech industry. His company’s chip designs are in the majority of devices you use on a daily basis, from your smartphone to your car. The SoftBank-backed company he leads is worth almost $150 billion, which is now considerably more than Intel. With the news earlier this week that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger “retired” and Intel is evaluating its options for a possible spinoff or outright sale, I wanted to hear what Haas thought should happen to his longtime frenemy. There were reports that he approached Intel about buying a big chunk of the company before Gelsinger was ousted. At the same time, Arm is also rumored to be eyeing an expansion into building its own chips and not just licensing its designs. Haas and I touched on all that and more in an exclusive interview earlier today, which will air in full on a future episode of Decoder. (You can listen to my episode about AI spending in the enterprise that just came out as well.) In the meantime, I wanted to give subscribers the first peek at the highlights from my conversation with Haas. The following interview has been edited and condensed: On what he makes of the Intel situation: As someone who has been in the industry my whole career, it is a little sad to see what’s happening… Intel is an innovation powerhouse. At the same time, you have to innovate in our industry. There are lots of tombstones of great tech companies that don’t reinvent themselves. I think Intel’s biggest dilemma is how to disassociate being either a vertical company or a fabless company, to oversimplify it. That is the fork in the road that they’ve faced for the last decade. Pat [Gelsinger] had a strategy that was very clear that vertical was the way to win. In my opinion, when he took that strategy on in 2021, that was not a three-year strategy. That was a five-to-10-year strategy. He’s gone and there’s a new CEO to be brought in and the decision has to be made. My personal bias says that vertical integration is a pretty powerful thing. If they could get that right, I think they would be in an amazing position. But the cost associated with it is so high that it may be too big of a hill to climb. I’m not going to comment on the rumors that we wanted to buy them. But I think, again, if you’re a vertically integrated company and the power of your strategy is in the fact that you have a product and you have fabs, inherently, you have a potential huge advantage in terms of cost versus the competition. When Pat was the CEO, I did tell him more than once, “You ought to license Arm because if you’ve got your own fabs, fabs are all about volume and we can provide volume.” I wasn’t successful in convincing him to do that. On the rumors that Arm will build its own AI chips: If you’re defining a computer architecture and you’re building the future of computing, one of the things you need to be very mindful of is that link between hardware and software in terms of really understanding where the tradeoffs are being made, where the observations are being made, what are the ultimate benefits to consumers from a chip that has that type of integration. That is easier to do if you’re building something than if you’re licensing IP… If you’re building something, you’re much closer to that interlock, and you have a much better perspective in terms of the design tradeoffs to make. So, if we were to do something, that would be one of the reasons. On Arm’s ongoing lawsuit with Qualcomm: The current update is that it plans to go to trial on December 16th, which isn’t very far away. I can appreciate — because we talk to investors and partners — that what they hate the most is uncertainty. But on the flip side, I would say the principles as to why we filed the claim are unchanged. On Sam Altman’s prediction that AGI will arrive in 2025: I know he has his own definitions for AGI and his reasons for those definitions. I don’t subscribe so much to what is AGI versus ASI [artificial superintelligence]. I think more around when these AI agents start to think and reason and invent. To me, that is a bit of a “cross the Rubicon” moment… If you would have asked me this question a year ago, I would have said it’s quite a ways away. You ask that question now, [and] I say it is much closer. On David Sacks being named President-elect Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar: Kudos to him. I think that’s a pretty good thing. It’s quite fascinating that if you go back eight years to Trump 1.0, in terms of where we were in December as he was starting to fill out his Cabinet choices and appointees, it was a bit chaotic. At the same time, there wasn’t a lot of representation from the tech world. This time around, whether it’s Elon [Musk], whether it’s David [Sacks], whether it’s Vivek [Ramaswamy] — I know Larry Ellison has been very, very involved in terms of discussions with the administration — I think it’s a good thing. Having a seat at the table and having access to policy, I think, is really good. Big leadership changes hit Samsung Electronics this week, per an internal memo I’ve obtained. North America CEO KS Choi is out and has been replaced by Yoonie Joung, a 33-year company veteran. Dave Das now solely oversees the mobile business while former co-head Brent Yoo is heading to Brazil to run sales there. And Shane Higby now runs the following divisions: Home Entertainment, Display, and Digital Appliance. There were a bunch of other shuffles at the C-level, but those are the highlights. Samsung has been restructuring across the board for months now and did layoffs in Choi’s division at the end of September, so this week’s news isn’t really a surprise. Perhaps the company hasn’t announced this news externally yet because its Korean investors will be meeting in the US next week (a company rep didn’t have a comment by press time). “Our sales have been down, especially in consumer electronics,” one company insider tells me. “My guess is that we’re just not hitting our targets quarter-over-quarter and so he [Choi] had to go.” It was fascinating to be in the audience at the DealBook Summit for the first public interview Jeff Bezos has done in years. While I maybe should have been expecting it, I was still shocked at how much he gushed about Donald Trump and his archnemesis for Blue Origin, Elon Musk. Another part of the interview that stood out was when Bezos said he is spending a lot of time at Amazon, “95-percent” of which is focused on AI. This week, Amazon announced its Nova family of foundational AI models at AWS re:Invent — a project I first scooped in this newsletter earlier this year. Amazon is obviously still playing catch-up in the AI race, but it seems to have closed meaningful ground with Nova. If anything, this week shows how quickly the AI race is still shifting. It feels like any of the big players could leap ahead at any moment. Even if you’re an AI skeptic, that’s pretty exciting.

Title: 6 Top Undervalued Stocks To Buy In December 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-06T19:26:44Z

getty With one interest rate cut in September and more likely on the way, 2025 could be a standout year for consumer spending. World Data Lab has projected next year's global consumer spending will reach $3.2 trillion. That translates to growth of almost 6%, fueled by 131 million new consumers. If the growth materializes, consumer discretionary stocks—and their shareholders—will benefit. That means it may be time to increase your exposure to the consumer discretionary sector. Even better, you can make the move with one of the potentially undervalued stocks introduced below. I picked the six top undervalued stocks for December by screening on these criteria: Note that these best stock picks are concentrated in one sector, so they are not intended to represent a diversified portfolio. They are presented as options for investors who want to capitalize on falling interest rates in 2025 and the positive effect that trend may have on consumer confidence.

After the table, I discuss each of these potentially undervalued stocks in more detail. Table data source: Stockanalysis.com. As you can see, these are mid-cap and large-cap stocks only. For smaller companies, see our small-cap value stock picks. You may also want to reference our list of value stocks for 2024. Amazon generates revenue from several sources. They include online and store-based retail sales in the U.S. and globally, online advertising, Amazon Prime memberships, logistics and support services for retailers and cloud computing. Since Amazon's third-quarter earnings release, at least 15 analysts have raised their AMZN price targets. The headlining takeaway from the release was 19% quarter-over-quarter growth in the AWS cloud computing business, attributed to strong AI infrastructure demand. AWS is faster-growing and higher-margin than retail sales for Amazon. However, e-commerce, including Prime memberships, still provides most of the company's revenue. Amazon is also the market share leader in U.S. e-commerce sales. Globally, the company accounts for 12% of gross merchandise volume sold online. With that positioning, Amazon should benefit from any measurable uptick in consumer spending. Like Amazon, Alibaba operates a diversified business model that includes e-commerce sales, display advertising, logistics and delivery services and cloud computing. The company is based in China and generates more than half of its revenue from retail e-commerce in its home country. At least five analysts have raised their price targets on Alibaba since the company's last earnings release. Others reiterated their targets and two lowered them. Alibaba also grew its cloud computing revenues, but growth in the company's international digital commerce group was much stronger. Revenues there were up 32% quarter over quarter. The division includes retailers AliExpress and Trendyol plus wholesale site Alibaba.com. One risk to note for Alibaba is the uncertain state of the Chinese economy. Recent stimulus efforts by the Chinese government have helped China's financial markets but consumer confidence remains low. Lululemon produces athletic apparel, footwear and accessories, with an emphasis on technical fabrics and functional designs. The company has deep roots in the yoga community. Products are sold through third-party retailers and directly to consumers via lululemon.com and company-owned stores. Analysts' reactions to Lululemon's last earnings report were mixed, with more target price reductions than increases. While the company beat earnings expectations, it missed on revenue. In 2024, LULU is down 37%. Investors have been worried about rising competition in the luxury athleisure space and the departure of the company's Chief Product Officer Sun Choe. Despite those issues, analysts largely still see upside for the apparel maker, particularly at the lower trading price. If the company can keep its line-up relevant and compelling, it should benefit from increasing consumer confidence next year.

The brand portfolio includes UGG, Hoka, Teva, Koolaburra and ANHU. The products are sold to customers around the world, online and through company-owned retail stores and third-party retailers. Deckers Outdoor has been handily beating analysts' revenue and earnings expectations for several quarters running. The latest earnings release outpaced EPS expectations by more than 28%, prompting several analysts to raise their price targets. DECK stock is up nearly 50% for the year on double-digit revenue gains plus a rising gross margin. Given the five-year EPS growth outlook of 64%, many believe DECK's impressive results will continue in the intermediate term. SharkNinja makes a range of lifestyle products under the Shark and Ninja brand names. Shark products include vacuums and hair styling tools. The Ninja line-up features cookware and small kitchen appliances, such as air fryers and beverage makers. Products are sold online and through third-party retailers. Like Deckers Outdoor, SharkNinja has made a habit of beating expectations recently. Highlights of the company's last earnings release included 33% net sales growth versus the prior-year quarter and a 160-basis-point increase in adjusted gross margin. SharkNinja's success is related in part to its ability to innovate solutions and launch products faster than competitors, according to JPMorgan analysts. The company routinely announces new products and line expansions as it works to optimize the supply chain. Investors like the balance of topline growth with expense control. SN stock is up nearly 80% on the year. Skechers designs, makes and sells footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. The company sells to retailers, marketplaces and directly to consumers (DTC). The DTC channels are skechers.com and a chain of retail stores. In its latest earnings release, Skechers reported 15.9% sales growth and 35.5% diluted EPS growth. The company also raised its full-year revenue and EPS outlook. One negative in the quarter was an 80-basis-point gross margin decline due to lower average selling prices. Despite the raised guidance and several analyst price target increases, SKX stock has not moved much since the late-October release. Given the upside and the generally bullish outlook on the company's five-year earnings outlook, now may be the time to buy. A 2025 uptick in consumer spending could deliver a nice lift to consumer discretionary stocks that already have business momentum. If you are ready to claim your piece of the potential profits, retailers like Amazon and Alibaba plus brand portfolios such as Decker Outdoors and SharkNinja, bought at the right price, could be perfect choices.

Title: Nvidia Partner Ooredoo Accelerates Data Center Acquisitions Amid Surging AI Demand

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Ooredoo is urgently seeking to acquire additional data centers to house Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) latest artificial intelligence chips, as highlighted by its chief executive, Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Supported by the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, the telecom company is aggressively increasing the capacity of its data centers and using strategic alliances to meet the rising demand for artificial intelligence-driven products. In June Ooredoo signed a major alliance with Nvidia to help this objective, therefore gaining access to the latest-generation graphics processing units. These GPUs will be housed across Ooredoo's 26 data centers spread throughout Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Tunisia, and the Maldives. By means of this alliance, Nvidia marks its first significant artificial intelligence deployment in the MENA area, therefore gaining access to markets from North Africa to South Asia. According to The Wall Street Journal, Ooredoo wants to employ these powerful Nvidia processors to meet the fast growing need for enhanced computing infrastructure, especially for generative artificial intelligence technology. Ooredoo has struggled to create new data centers fast enough to satisfy the growing demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure notwithstanding the strategic cooperation. The Wall Street Journal claims that right now the corporation is concentrating on acquisitions as a more practical way to handle these problems. Complementing its present 40-megawatt capacity, Ooredoo has pledged $1 billion to increase the capacity of its data center by another 2025 megawatts. With an eye toward giving governments, businesses, and startups throughout the region access to innovative AI resources, Ooredoo intends to almost treble its data center capacity by the end of the decade. Apart from its alliance with Nvidia, Ooredoo's Indonesian division, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, worked with GoTo Gojek Tokopedia in November to introduce Sahabat-AI, an AI language model ecosystem meant to support Indonesian languages. Designed in association with AI Singapore and Tech Mahindra, this project trains and improves AI skills using Nvidia's AI Enterprise platform. Along with its alliances, Ooredoo's strategic emphasis on data center acquisitions shows its dedication to propel digital transformation and innovation all throughout the MENA area. Using Nvidia's cutting-edge technologies and growing data center footprint will help Ooredoo position itself as a major participant in the AI and digital transformation scene and satisfy the fast growing needs for AI infrastructure.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks mostly rose on Friday as investors digested the last monthly jobs report of the year, a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8% as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) gained, tapping all-time intraday highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has all the details here. The report largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading — strong enough to dampen concerns about the economy but soft enough to keep the Fed's options open on lowering rates this month and into next year. On Friday, markets were pricing in near-90% odds the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool, compared with about 70% before the report. Meanwhile, the rally in bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued after slipping, trading around $101,000 Friday afternoon. Options show some investors are hedging against a deeper pullback after the leading token's record-breaking surge to over $100,000 for the first time. The rally has been spurred by hopes of support for digital currencies from President-elect Donald Trump, who on Thursday named former PayPal (PYPL) COO David Sacks as his "White House AI & Crypto Czar." On the corporate front, shares of Lululemon (LULU) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped after the retailers both boosted profit forecasts. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy US stocks mostly rose on Friday and notched gains for the week as investors took the latest monthly jobs report as a sign that the Fed will likely cut interest rates again later this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8%, with several tech giants touching new highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. If Friday's labor market reading likely kept the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates later this month, next week's inflation reading is perhaps the final key data point that could alter that storyline. On Wednesday, a closely watched report on US inflation will give the Federal Reserve another glimpse into consumer prices before they are set to meet for their last policy huddle of the year. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprises to the upside, that might pressure central bankers to halt their interest rate cutting. But as of Friday afternoon, Wall Street largely expects the Fed to cut rates by another quarter percentage. The economic calendar also includes wholesale inventories and the import price index. A handful of major corporate names are set to deliver earnings reports next week. Among the tickers are GameStop (GME), Macy's (M), Costco (COST), and Broadcom (AVGO). Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok's loss is Meta (META)'s gain. Shares of Facebook's parent company rose nearly 3% Friday afternoon following a US appeals court decision that upheld a law banning TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. The decision, which could be overturned by the Supreme Court, increases the likelihood that the short-form video app will be banned in the US. That would seriously diminish a rising competitor to American social media and digital advertising platforms. The stocks of several US tech giants rose on the news. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), the corporate parent of Google and YouTube, gained 1%. TikTok's future isn't set, however. In addition to the legal challenges that ByteDance could pursue, there is also the unknown of what resident-elect Trump could do. As Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reports, his statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of the law. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Lululemon (LULU): Shares of the athletic apparel company soared Friday afternoon on the back of strong third quarter results. Lululemon raised its full-year revenue forecast after beating estimates across the top and bottom line, thanks in large part to the brand's strength in international markets. Palantir (PLTR): The big data analytics company rose more than 5% Friday after signing a new AI partnership with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH). Palantir is up more than 300% so far this year, riding the momentum of advancements in AI technology. Shopify (SHOP): Shares of the e-commerce platform gained 5% Friday following an upgrade from Loop Capital from a Hold to a Buy, nodding to the company's use of AI. Loop raised its price target to $140, reflecting a 23% potential upside to the stock. Ulta Beauty (ULTA): The cosmetic store chain is rallying after the company beat third quarter earnings estimates Thursday and as executives raised their forecasts for full-year earnings. Net sales for the quarter increased by 1.7% to $2.5 billion. Shares rose 10% Friday afternoon. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shot up above $101,000 at around 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday after falling below the $100,000 milestone level. On Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump announced venture capitalist David Sacks will be his incoming administration's "AI and crypto czar." Bitcoin reached new highs late Wednesday, surpassing $100,000 for the first time following Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is seen as a crypto-friendly pick for the position. The token cleared $103,000 after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social early Thursday to cheer the recent all-time highs, telling crypto enthusiasts that they are welcome for the rally that has followed his election win last month. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!" Trump wrote. "Together, we will Make America Great Again!" A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher in afternoon trading Friday as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. Several Big Tech names also hit intraday highs, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the outlier among the major indexes, shedding about 0.1%. But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.6%. A US federal appeals court upheld a new law that outlaws TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. The plan could still be altered by the Supreme Court or affected by President-elect Donald Trump, who in September suggested in a social media post that he would "save TikTok" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner by Jan. 19, 2025, or have it banned from operations in the country. TikTok challenged the law by arguing it violated the US Constitution in taking away the First Amendment rights of TikTok's US entity and its users. But a panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the government's law withstood constitutional scrutiny by protecting free speech in the US "from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States." Read about the latest on the government's effort to ban TikTok under Chinese ownership here. A labor market rebound announced Friday is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point later this month, absent any upside surprises to inflation, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "For the Fed, this doesn't change the narrative," Robert Sockin, Citigroup's senior chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. The new jobs numbers are "right in the spot of what they were looking for and they are comfortable with to continue easing policy" at the last meeting of the year, on Dec. 17-18. Traders boosted the odds of a rate cut at that meeting to 91% following the data release. But Fed watchers agreed that the robust jobs picture and recent stickiness in inflation reinforce a mounting conviction that the pace of rate cuts in 2025 will be less aggressive than once expected. Read about how the latest labor market readings will steer the Federal Reserve's next policy decision here. Consumers are growing more concerned about the path forward for inflation over the next year. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed that consumers expect inflation to hit 2.9% in a year, an increase from last month's expectation of 2.6%. December's reading is the highest in six months but within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation slipped higher, though, falling to 3.1% from 3.2% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 74, up from 71.8 in November. Overall, consumer views on inflation varied based on political party, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu noted. "Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation," Hsu said in the release. "Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation." Also in this month's data, the survey showed a large increase in buying conditions for durable goods, which boosted current economic conditions by more than 20%. "Rather than a sign of strength, this rise in durables was primarily due to a perception that purchasing durables now would enable buyers to avoid future price increases," Hsu said. A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained about 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% after the gauges drifted away from all-time highs at Thursday's close. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. The US labor market rebounded from an October swoon, adding more jobs than expected in November, while the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2%. Here's the breakdown on the November hiring front: Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has all the details here. Economic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls (November); Unemployment rate (November); Average hourly earnings & Average weekly hours worked (November); Labor force participation rate (November) Earnings: BRP (DOOO) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Bitcoin's biggest players: The four groups to know BofA's Hartnett warns froth is building in US stocks, crypto Big changes are coming to AI in 2025: Microsoft Trump names ex-PayPal exec David Sacks as AI and crypto 'Czar' Cash draws biggest weekly inflow since March 2023: BofA Musk’s xAI Wraps Up $6 Billion in Funding in Latest Round BP eyes $3B sale of big stake in US natural gas pipelines Sign in to access your portfolio

The plan could still be altered by the Supreme Court or affected by President-elect Donald Trump, who in September suggested in a social media post that he would "save TikTok" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner by Jan. 19, 2025, or have it banned from operations in the country. TikTok challenged the law by arguing it violated the US Constitution in taking away the First Amendment rights of TikTok's US entity and its users. But a panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the government's law withstood constitutional scrutiny by protecting free speech in the US "from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States."

The new jobs numbers are "right in the spot of what they were looking for and they are comfortable with to continue easing policy" at the last meeting of the year, on Dec. 17-18.

But Fed watchers agreed that the robust jobs picture and recent stickiness in inflation reinforce a mounting conviction that the pace of rate cuts in 2025 will be less aggressive than once expected.

Consumers are growing more concerned about the path forward for inflation over the next year. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed that consumers expect inflation to hit 2.9% in a year, an increase from last month's expectation of 2.6%. December's reading is the highest in six months but within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation slipped higher, though, falling to 3.1% from 3.2% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 74, up from 71.8 in November. Overall, consumer views on inflation varied based on political party, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu noted. "Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation," Hsu said in the release. "Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation." Also in this month's data, the survey showed a large increase in buying conditions for durable goods, which boosted current economic conditions by more than 20%. "Rather than a sign of strength, this rise in durables was primarily due to a perception that purchasing durables now would enable buyers to avoid future price increases," Hsu said.

Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8% as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) gained, tapping all-time intraday highs.

The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has all the details here. The report largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading — strong enough to dampen concerns about the economy but soft enough to keep the Fed's options open on lowering rates this month and into next year. On Friday, markets were pricing in near-90% odds the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool, compared with about 70% before the report. Meanwhile, the rally in bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued after slipping, trading around $101,000 Friday afternoon. Options show some investors are hedging against a deeper pullback after the leading token's record-breaking surge to over $100,000 for the first time. The rally has been spurred by hopes of support for digital currencies from President-elect Donald Trump, who on Thursday named former PayPal (PYPL) COO David Sacks as his "White House AI & Crypto Czar."

If Friday's labor market reading likely kept the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates later this month, next week's inflation reading is perhaps the final key data point that could alter that storyline. On Wednesday, a closely watched report on US inflation will give the Federal Reserve another glimpse into consumer prices before they are set to meet for their last policy huddle of the year. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprises to the upside, that might pressure central bankers to halt their interest rate cutting. But as of Friday afternoon, Wall Street largely expects the Fed to cut rates by another quarter percentage. The economic calendar also includes wholesale inventories and the import price index. A handful of major corporate names are set to deliver earnings reports next week. Among the tickers are GameStop (GME), Macy's (M), Costco (COST), and Broadcom (AVGO). Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok's loss is Meta (META)'s gain. Shares of Facebook's parent company rose nearly 3% Friday afternoon following a US appeals court decision that upheld a law banning TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. The decision, which could be overturned by the Supreme Court, increases the likelihood that the short-form video app will be banned in the US. That would seriously diminish a rising competitor to American social media and digital advertising platforms. The stocks of several US tech giants rose on the news. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), the corporate parent of Google and YouTube, gained 1%. TikTok's future isn't set, however. In addition to the legal challenges that ByteDance could pursue, there is also the unknown of what resident-elect Trump could do. As Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reports, his statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of the law. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Lululemon (LULU): Shares of the athletic apparel company soared Friday afternoon on the back of strong third quarter results. Lululemon raised its full-year revenue forecast after beating estimates across the top and bottom line, thanks in large part to the brand's strength in international markets. Palantir (PLTR): The big data analytics company rose more than 5% Friday after signing a new AI partnership with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH). Palantir is up more than 300% so far this year, riding the momentum of advancements in AI technology. Shopify (SHOP): Shares of the e-commerce platform gained 5% Friday following an upgrade from Loop Capital from a Hold to a Buy, nodding to the company's use of AI. Loop raised its price target to $140, reflecting a 23% potential upside to the stock. Ulta Beauty (ULTA): The cosmetic store chain is rallying after the company beat third quarter earnings estimates Thursday and as executives raised their forecasts for full-year earnings. Net sales for the quarter increased by 1.7% to $2.5 billion. Shares rose 10% Friday afternoon. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shot up above $101,000 at around 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday after falling below the $100,000 milestone level. On Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump announced venture capitalist David Sacks will be his incoming administration's "AI and crypto czar." Bitcoin reached new highs late Wednesday, surpassing $100,000 for the first time following Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is seen as a crypto-friendly pick for the position. The token cleared $103,000 after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social early Thursday to cheer the recent all-time highs, telling crypto enthusiasts that they are welcome for the rally that has followed his election win last month. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!" Trump wrote. "Together, we will Make America Great Again!" A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher in afternoon trading Friday as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. Several Big Tech names also hit intraday highs, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META).

Title: Bitcoin is the ultimate new luxury? ￼

Time Published: 2024-12-06T13:51:50Z

Best way to convince someone or people to do something is not to praise its virtues, but to promote the idea that in fact it is a luxury? For example, living a spartan and aesthetic lifestyle, it is not self abnegation in you’re not positively doing self harm, but instead, it is the new luxury to be Spartan, disconnected, off the grid etc. In fact, what is the best way to Schwab or brag? Not to brag or show off how much stuff you owe or whatever… But instead, bragging and showing off the fact that in fact, you don’t check or use email for a living? Or use email at all? Invisible wealth. Very interesting things; if you are in fact a really really really truly rich person the question is: do you in fact want people to know in real life that in fact, you are really rich? Of course not! Then everyone is going to try to sneakily get at you and your wealth, and also, rob or hijack or jack you. For Example, what is the best way to get dropped? Going to the club with the Rolex on your left wrist; you could identify a Rolex watch from a mile away based on the chain-link pattern, the way it shines and glistens. As a consequence, the funny thing with wealth is a little bit ironic and bizarre; First, what do you want to signal? Do you want to signify your wealth of prestige and power? Or would you prefer to stay low-key? For example, once again when it comes to cars and automobiles; it is generally not a good idea to be known. For example, all the real Hollywood producers and people who run and own the media, all of them desire to be unknown. Why? They want to be able to go out in public, enjoy their lives, go on a walk without getting mobbed, without the paparazzi following them everywhere. I have a funny theories; actors and directors are essentially sacrificial lamb; or scapegoats; they are promised all this wealth power and prestige but in fact, they end up just becoming targets for the Hollywood producers who have the real wealth and power and prestige. The true Hollywood producers then, can enjoy the upside of their anonymity, proceeded in life as usual, without getting their lives ruined by TMZ. So, the general idea; so how can you store your wealth, hide your wealth, without anybody knowing it? And without inciting the envy of your neighbors, other people, etc.? First, not driving a flashy car. If you know somebody who is a real millionaire or a bitcoin billionaire or whatever, and they still drive a Toyota Prius, know that they’re onto something good. Second, ultimate self clothing. If you are a real connoisseur, you are going to be wearing only cashmere, wool, Merino wool, the finest of materials, all without letters or stitching or monograms or logos. Why? Because once again certainly there is a grand upside to having better materials, superior materials to keep you warm and cozy, and protected from the elements. For example, in the winter time, when it is really really cold and miserable outside, your best bet is wool and cashmere. Not some loser Louis Vuitton something. And also, leather. Leather is very very simple and also a grand and great luxury. As much as these loser animal rights activist may say otherwise; leather is superior and supreme. Even a random Prada iPad case which I was gifted at this one Prada pop-up show, Which was used on the original iPad, which hilariously still fits my new iPad Pro M4 chip, it feels so luxurious so inside, once again, pure leather is the way. So the big issue here is that eco-friendly stuff doesn’t last, the quality is poor, the durability is poor. It sucks in almost every single regard. I have a theory; the only reason you have a lot of these companies trying to promote ￼ eco-friendly stuff in eco-friendly materials because they are all essentially derivatives of plastic, recycled plastic and polyester, which is hard cheaper to produce, create, market and sell, and also it has much higher profit margins. Therefore we are being suckered into using really really bad materials, all for the sake of fattening their wallets, not for the planet. In fact, if you think about it, a lot of these materials are made out of petroleum and oil, and I don’t even think they disintegrate that well, whereas if you have a leather or something, not only will that last for generations, in theory it should decompose better in the Earth than some sort of junky plastic. Even funny enough when you see these sci-fi movies of the future, they are not wearing these recycled polyester suits, most of the people in Blade Runner or whatever are wearing leather jackets, just like a Ryan Gosling from Blade Runner 2049. Once again, leather jacket, Cow and or sheep fur lining. Even in the early days of aviation, a lot of these aviation pilots were very very thick sheep fleet interior jackets, and thick leather high jackets gloves hats etc. to keep them warm. Back in the days before all of this nonsense call eco-friendly fashion, which is once again, consumerism with a good conscience. I think what a lot of fools don’t understand is that in fact, bitcoin may be the best thing for the planet in the human race. Why? It lasts forever. Not 100 years not 1000 years, try 100,000 years. As long as a human race exist, on earth space from Mars or even on a spaceship with intergalactic Internet, Bitcoin shall last. In fact, if I was jumping on a spaceship and getting ready to settle to Mars, or thinking about Seneca’s kids kids kids kids kids, certainly it seems plausible that rather than taking US dollars, Fiat currency, gold bars, or Lamborghinis with them to space, certainly they will take bitcoin which is real, yet weightless. Of course you have seen the campuses, you have seen the playgrounds, you have seen the mediocre Google pixel devices;; yet, have you ever seen a search engine in real life? People that might talk about the Google data centers, but you fools don’t you know that the bitcoin monetary network is like taking all the data centers but Amazon Google Facebook meadow whatever and combined it times 10? Or like having 20 full on nuclear reactors powering it? So bitcoin just broke $103,000 a bitcoin the other day, December 5, 2024… A day not to forget, also my mom’s birthday. So the first thought is why did it pop so hard? I think it is because at a world economic Russia forum, Vladimir Putin himself commented and said that bitcoin is unstoppable, you cannot stop two human beings from sending electronic payments or stuff between one another with their phones, and that it was wise to adopt new technologies as they came. And also, Russia is in a bit of a squeeze; they kind of know they are dependent on America, and now with the war with Ukraine, they are slowly getting squeezed out of the picture. And as a consequence, how can the Russian store their wealth? Maybe in gold bars, but gold bars are not very practical for transferring billions of dollars of value instantly across the planet. For example if you are Russia with $100 billion of gold bars, trying to do commerce with mainland China… How many military vehicles do you employed to securitize the gold, to prevent pirates from stealing it? And very very interesting on a recent interview that Michael Saylor had with yahoo news, is that actually, in terms of American technological supremacy, and monetary supremacy, America should just immediately sell all of her gold reserves, and just buy bitcoin instead, ideally buying up at least 20% of the world‘s bitcoin monetary network. Why? This would immediately demonetize gold, which is once again, the reserve asset which our enemies use. So then there would be a double win-win situation; first, America is still able to assert her US dollar dominance on the planet, against all of the BRICS nations, and also, become the central superpower, ideally forever in the context of money power and capital? ￼ kind of a funny observation; I’ve actually discovered there are a bunch of Eric’s in the bitcoin world, ERIC Semmler of semler scientific, the company which is also on the bitcoin standard, also ERIC Trump who I guess is one of the sons of Donald Trump, who is also apparently really into bitcoin, also, another ERIC in Bloomberg who writes about ETFs, there’s a lot of us. Anyways, as of late I’ve had a stronger conviction, telling all my close friends and family that actually care for to get themselves and their family and their portfolios onto the bitcoin standard. This means like putting all your wealth into bitcoin, and for stocks and retirement IRA Roth IRA whatever, putting it all into microstrategy MSTR stock. I’ve been giving a lot of young family members unsolicited advice about microstrategy, and they were all grateful because it went up a lot! Everyone is always feeling like they missed the boat, but as long as you buy it for less than $1 million, you’re still going to get a 90% discount. And also, a funny and simple thought is that similarly speaking, I can also imagine that I’ll be buying bitcoin even when it is $1 million of bitcoin and beyond. I’m also certain I will be buying bitcoin when it is $10million a bitcoin, and maybe even when it is $100 million a bitcoin. So bitcoin is really interesting to me because it is the world’s first hard money and capital. Typically capital has been parked in real estate for so long because for the most part it was scarce, desirable, and also resistant to traditional fiat currency. For example, in the past, if you parked all of your capital into US dollars, or the Dutch guilder, you would have effectively senior wealth go down to zero. I saw an advertisement that in 1920 you could purchase a home in Culver City for $250, and now it is worth what, $2.1 million dollars? So this is also $1 million question or maybe $1 trillion question or 100 trillion or a $350 trillion question: How can you monetize bitcoin? It’s kind of like the same of saying that if I bought Manhattan in the year 1624, how can I collect to rent from it? Or, like imagine in the early days the Internet, nobody had any idea how to make money off of it. Even the early days of Google, I still remember finding Google and finding about Google in a search engine engines for dummies book when I was around like 11 or 12 years old, And it was a simple search engine, just the Google search icon, and I’m feeling lucky button. It seems that maybe like 15 years later they found out ways to make money through search advertisements. Same with Facebook, it’s pretty impressive, that Mark Zuckerberg was able to take some sort of college prank, and transform it into billions of dollars of value. Once again same thing with advertising. So I think with bitcoin it will be the same. They will be very very easy ways for people to monetize bitcoin, but just give it some time! Why in such a hurry or rush? So you should certainly not touch your bitcoin for at least four years, 10 years, ideally never. Why? Do not trade your gold for copper, no matter how good the trade may seem. So for example, people still have this foolish idea that when bitcoin is up you should sell it and buy something “real“, like real estate or a single-family home or property or US dollars whatever. These fools are still stuck in the days of AOL 3.0, 38.8 K tile up Internet, blockbuster and the like. Michael Saylor also had an interesting history of science analogy; imagine that only bicycles existed and boom, somebody comes out with a motorcycle Ducati. Certainly there is no turning wings of time back. Or let us say that you were in the 1920s, and everyone is driving this horse and carriage buggy whips, or Ford model T’s. If this is the case, imagine then somebody pulls up with a cyber truck, all Matte black, certainly people would think that you’re some sort of alien or god. ￼ So imagine that God came from heaven, he came down to earth, and told us: I shall give you the most supreme and sublime money in capital. It shall be immortal, infinitely divisible, portable, it will last and live forever on the Internet in the cloud, both online and off-line, it will be censorship resistant, it will be politically neutral; and, you could just memorize the password in your head, and hand down the password to your descendants to own forever as long as they just remember the words. Wouldn’t this be like the best invention of all time? I watch a funny film called God bless bitcoin, and the similar idea was that there are some religious folks who believe that from even a religious perspective, it is ethical. Jewish people, Islamic people, and Christian people all like it. A good sign. I think the only people who don’t like bitcoin are essentially the people who are still stuck in the old ways. For example, your uncle who still refuses to use an iPhone, and prefers his Motorola razor flip-phone instead. Or, your grandma who is still used to going to blockbuster to borrow VHS cassettes to watch at home, on her CRT television, with the VCR player, and also with a little Ferrari rewinding VHS cassette thing. So for example, it took me a very very long time for me to explain to my mom what cloud services were, what the cloud was, etc. She still does not understand 100% of how it works, but she gets it. She shoots pictures on her iPhone, and they remain accessible Kind of forever. Also, FaceTime. Certainly it works, but how it works, like the science of how it actually works, is befuddling. Yet nobody second-guesses it.￼Or, modern day electricity, and heat and water and plumbing and sewage and sanitation. Most people have zero idea how it is made, yet we are all grateful for it. So if you have ever tried sleeping in a hot stuffy humid apartment at 120° in Southeast Asia during the summertime, you know that air conditioning might be one of the best blessings of all time to humanity. Or try to imagine walking around in Dubai in the summertime without air-conditioning in your house your car or the mall. Do you have a lot of these full saying that bitcoin is bad for the pineapple blah blah blah, but don’t you fools know that bitcoin only takes like .1% of the world’s energy, whereas air conditioning I think counts for about 33.3% of the world electricity usage? Yet nobody is trying to ban Air-conditioning! This is also another thing, I don’t really like gasoline cars, tailpipe emissions whatever, but, if suddenly overnight you band petroleum gas and the like, 95% of humidity would immediately starve or freeze to death. So I think from a basic perspective, things and economics should be optimized to think about first, the well-being of humans. Once again love these people who are too much into the environment, environmentalist, I think it is kind of a new weird cult religion; a lot of these people don’t believe in God anymore or go to church, yet have found some sort of salvation in this metaphorical mother Gaia? I get it everyone needs something to believe in, but, I think the issue here is tyrant vs choice. First, it is a free country. The land of the free. You should have the freedom to choose. This is the number one ethos of America and being American.P and this is where everyone on the political spectrum don’t understand things; if a woman wanted an abortion let her do it, if somebody wants to chop off their penis and balls and sterilize themselves, go ahead and let them do it. And maybe on the other side if somebody wants to own a gun, just let them do it. Or if they want to masturbate to an American flag let them do it. I think what then becomes the important imperative of year is once again, giving people an option and choice! And also, having the freedom and protection from idiots, on all sides of the political spectrum? For example guns, yeah yeah yeah everyone should have the right to own it, but please, don’t bring a gun to a wedding and leave it unattended in your backpack, only to have a drunk crazy lady at the wedding trying to steal everyone’s stuff in the bag coat room, finding the gun, getting surprise, and leaving it on top of your child’s car seat. (True story happened to me, I found a gun on Seneca’s car seat). I only think God that I did not accidentally pull the trigger or he did not pull the trigger or some other kid did not accidentally pull the trigger, either killing Seneca, myself Cindy or anyone else at the party. Once again, there are lots of crazy people out there and everyone is going to do crazy things to themselves, they own families whatever. But let them do all the crazy shit they want to do, just stay away from them. So similarly maybe we should have the freedom to be protected from these weirdos? So the joy and glory bitcoin is fascinating some one bitcoin hit 100 K and beyond, it was like the best party on the Internet of all time. Twitter was going absolutely insane; everyone is having a great time. I could feel the joy and enthusiasm on the Internet, all these people bursting into tears and crying, barely holding their emotions. I’m starting to get the sense of religious forever for bitcoin, which is always a good sign. Even the early days of Apple, Steve Jobs was the priest, and Apple and Apple Store was the temple. People used to camp outside the Apple Store for the new iPhone, not anymore. Apple can barely give away their products now. ￼ All the tech companies are languishing. Facebook and Meta and Instagram is getting destroyed by TikTok, the evil mainland Chinese corporation I think run by Tencent. As much bad as Google Amazon Facebook YouTube gets, no no no you fools, TikTok and China is the real enemy. And also video games, anything run by riot games or has major investment from mainland China are all bad and evil for yourself your kids or family. I would say, if I had one piece of advice to Donald Trump is that it would be just banning TikTok from America. Think about the asymmetry here; mainland China blocks all major American tech stuff in China, yet, we allow TikTok to run shores chores? I think me and them in Chinese corporations and people, especially post Malong communist upheaval, and destruction of confusion values, they no longer have any values besides more power, influence, money and capital. Just think about it, what is the apple of China’s eye? China wants to obviously become stronger and more powerful than America, yet knows that she cannot do it unless she does trade with America. If overnight we introduced 1000% tariff to all mainland Chinese things in corporations, with death and famine for mainland China. Just imagine if Donald Trump overnight declared a martial law saying that it was in fact, 100% illegal for Apple to produce any products at Foxconn in mainland China, what would that spell for me and China, and also Apple? The good news is I think we could still produce things here in America, we might not have an affordable iPhone anymore, but still… It would get done. If you had an iPhone that was 100% made only in America, it might be like 10 X the price, either that or maybe it will just be switched to some sort of expensive subscription model, but still, America would function. I don’t think China would. There is no censorship on TikTok, no content is ever flagged or taken down. Because once again, China does not care for any sort of ethics or copyright or whatever here; even during the para Olympics, and the only copyrighted videos I could watch of the Olympics were like Screen shares on TikTok? If you ever talk to any shoes liberal American, the one that is phd educated, apparently very very liberal in whatever, yet anti capitalism, just asked them, what is the origin of money, and how can they afford to pay their mortgage, or rent, or Tesla, or the gasoline for their Prius car? Or for their Whole Foods farmers markets? One might say that real money is gold, but the reason why gold is unethical is that it takes slave labor for them to produce it, ￼ and all the petroleum and gas influence created to just extract it from the Earth. And also, gold is relatively scarce but not a real scarcity ; nobody really knows how much gold lies beneath the earths crust,￼ and I could guarantee you, if suddenly overnight it is declared that gold is now $1 million an ounce, there would be a lot of capital being poured in that would mine for and discover more gold. Even at current rates, I think they extract 3% more gold every single year. So then, let us say that real wealth is not cold, then what is it? Fiat currency? Obviously not! So an observation I’ve made a few years ago is that even though I am anti-war in anti-military for the most part, unfortunately it is critical for America to have the biggest stick in order to continue the US dollar supremacy. For example, America owes what like $35 or $350 trillion of debt or some insane number, two China and Russia and whatever, what prevents America from repaying it? Our military power! And it is kind of pernicious; just go to the defense.gov website, and see how much money is being poured into Lockheed Martin, Boeing in these other defense contractors. It is really kind of bad because it is almost like a snake eating its own tail; America continues to raise her military and defense budget, and these defense contractors are getting rewarded and awarded even ever higher dollar amounts for stuff, even apparently Boeing tried to sell two jets for the president for $4.5 billion, once again taxpayer money. As a consequence, the ordinary working person in America is being squeezed; if government defense spending is that high, just imagine how much this hurts the American taxpayer who works hard and saves diligently, only to have her hard earned money being poured into some sort of stupid luxury jet and government overspending? ￼ When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin!

Title: Pick ZS Stock Over F5?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/06/pick-zs-stock-over-f5/
Time Published: 2024-12-06T12:00:43Z
Full Content:
UKRAINE - 2021/02/23: In this photo illustration, Zscaler logo of US cloud-based information ... [+] security company is seen displayed on a smartphone and pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) After a solid Q1, we think Zscaler stock (NASDAQ: ZS), a cloud-based security platform, is currently a better pick over its peer – F5 stock (NASDAQ: FFIV). ZS stock trades at 14x trailing revenues, versus 5x for FFIV stock, thanks to Zscaler’s superior revenue growth. Zscaler recently announced its Q1 fiscal 2025 results, with revenue of $628 million and adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $606 million and $0.63, respectively. The company’s outlook of $2.6 billion in sales and $2.97 (mid-point) in adjusted earnings was also slightly better than the street estimates. Still, the stock dropped 8% following the Q1 announcement. Also see Here’s Why American Eagle Outfitters’ Stock Slumped. There could be a few factors at play for this decline in ZS, including the fact that the stock had run-up 14% from $182 in early November to $208 on December 2, and investors booked some profits. Also, with the sales growth rate slowing lately, investors may not be willing to assign a higher valuation multiple for the stock. That said, the stock has seen some recovery from levels of $191 on December 2 to $206 now. Below we discuss why we think ZS is a better pick over FFIV, by comparing a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, stock returns, and valuation. FFIV stock has seen a 44% rise from levels of $175 in early January 2021 to around $255 now, while ZS stock has seen little change from $200 to $205 over the same period. This compares with an increase of about 60% for the S&P 500 over this roughly four-year period. Overall, the performance of FFIV and ZS stocks with respect to the index has been far from consistent. Returns for FFIV stock were 39% in 2021, -41% in 2022, and 25% in 2023, while ZS stock returns were 61%, -65%, and 98%, respectively. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 — indicating that both FFIV and ZS underperformed the S&P in 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including, CSCO and META, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. F5’s revenue has risen at a 2.7% average annual rate from $2.6 billion in 2021 to $2.8 billion now. In comparison, Zscaler’s average revenue growth rate of 48.1% from $673 million to $2.3 billion over the same period, has been much better. F5’s revenues growth is being driven by both – services and product – amid the company’s entry into new markets. Zscaler’s revenue growth is led by an increase in customer base as well as rise in subscriptions. The company’s customer base has increased from 5,600 in 2021 to 8,650 now. The company is benefiting from increased subscription revenue toward additional users and add-on services. This trend is expected to continue in the near term. However, the company’s sales growth rate has slowed from 48% average over the last three years to 21% expected in the next few years. This still fares much better than F5, which is expected to see its top-line expand at a mid-single-digit average annual rate over the next few years. F5’s adjusted net income margin improved from 25.8% in 2021 to 28.2% in 2024, while that for Zscaler jumped from 11.2% to 23.4% over the same period. Looking at the last twelve months period, F5’s 28.2% net income margin fares better than 22.9% for Zscaler. Looking at financial risk, Zscaler seems to have an edge over F5. Both companies have low debt levels. F5’s 2% debt as a percentage of equity is slightly better than 4% for Zscaler. However, the latter’s 58% cash as a percentage of assets is much better than 19% for F5. This implies that Zscaler has more cash cushion. We see that Zscaler has seen better revenue growth and has more cash cushion. On the other hand, F5 is more profitable and has a slightly better debt position. Now, looking at prospects, we believe ZS stock will offer higher returns in the next three years. FFIV stock trades at 5x trailing revenues, aligning with the stock’s average P/S ratio over the last four years. In comparison, ZS stock trades at 14x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 30x over the last four years. Now, some decline in valuation multiple for ZS seems justified, given the fall in revenue growth rate. It may likely fall further to more reasonable levels over the coming years. However, a decline in P/S ratio will be more than offset by growth in sales, given the expected surge in revenues, and thereby resulting in higher levels for ZS stock. While ZS stock may outperform FFIV, it is helpful to see how F5’s peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SSR Mining Inc. (Nasdaq/TSX: SSRM; ASX: SSR) (SSR Mining (NASDAQ:SSRM) or the Company) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine (CC&V) in Colorado from Newmont Corporation (Newmont) in an all-cash deal for $100 million in upfront consideration and up to $175 million in additional milestone-based payments (the Transaction (JO:TCPJ)). This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241205981031/en/ Figure 1. Overview of SSR Mining's global platform, inclusive of the Cripple Creek & Victor gold mine. 3 (Graphic: Business Wire) Strategic Rationale for the Transaction Rod Antal, Executive Chairman of SSR Mining, said, The acquisition of the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine represents a rare opportunity to add a high-quality producing asset in a Tier-1 jurisdiction at an accretive valuation. CC&V is a proven operation with excellent potential for upside, and expands our U.S. based platform to an expected 300,000 “ 400,000 ounces of average annual gold production, positioning SSR Mining as the third largest gold producer in the United States. This acquisition ensures our portfolio of both producing and development assets is well balanced and provides our company with a diversified and long-lived free cash flow focused platform comprised of six key assets. The Transaction structure helps ensure our balance sheet remains a strength of our business, with CC&V expected to immediately contribute meaningful cash flow that facilitates an attractive payback. In addition to its strategic merits, CC&V employs many highly regarded mining professionals that will complement our current team, and we look forward to welcoming them all into SSR Mining. We would also like to thank Newmont for their responsible stewardship of CC&V over the last nine years. Looking ahead, we have a clear path forward, with a focus on delivering growth initiatives at each of our six key assets as we look to build our position as a leading mid-tier gold producer. Transaction Overview Consideration for the acquisition of CC&V is comprised of: Upon completion of an updated regulator-approved closure plan and in the event aggregate closure costs at CC&V exceed $500 million, SSR Mining will be responsible for funding 10% of the incremental closure costs while Newmont will be responsible for funding 90% of the incremental closure costs, either on an as-incurred basis or pursuant to a lump sum payment option. The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, upon satisfaction of preclosing conditions and the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. SSR Mining expects to provide 2025 guidance for CC&V in due course following the closing of the Transaction. Overview of the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine CC&V is located approximately 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Denver, Colorado. Mining in the district dates back to the 1890's, with large-scale surface mining commencing in 1994. Currently, CC&V operations span three developed open pit areas: Globe Hill, Schist Island, and South Cresson with a total land package of more than 5,000 hectares (see Figure 2). CC&V is an epithermal gold deposit associated with alkalic intrusive rocks mined via conventional open pit mining methods. All of the current Mineral Reserves are oxides, which are stacked on valley leach facilities as either run of mine (ROM) material or after a two-stage crush. Average annual ore placement on the valley leach facilities is approximately 20 to 24 million short tons per annum, and current permitted and available leach pad capacity is more than 125 million short tons. Newmont applied for Amendment 14 to extend the mine life by adding 189 million short tons of leach pad capacity through construction of Phase 4 of the Valley Leach Facility 2 (˜VLF2') and Phase 6 of Valley Leach Facility 1 (˜VLF1'), amongst other operational considerations including pit laybacks and road adjustments. A mill facility for sulfide and transitional ore is currently on care and maintenance and does not factor into CC&V's current mine plan. Newmont has disclosed that, since acquiring the asset in 2015 for $820 million in cash, CC&V has produced over 2.5 million ounces of gold. Geology The Cripple Creek deposit occurs at the southern end of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, hosted in Oligocene age alkaline volcanic and intrusive rocks within a basement package of Proterozoic intrusives and metamorphosed sediments. The volcanic diatreme complex hosting the deposit is predominantly comprised of the Cripple Creek breccia, a heterolithic and poorly sorted unit consisting of airfall tuff, massive breccia and bedded volcaniclastics. These volcanics are crosscut by numerous intrusions, including phonolitic stocks, lamprophyres and aphanitic dykes, which corresponded in timing with, or preceded, the bulk of the gold mineralization in the epithermal Cripple Creek deposit. Mineralization occurs primarily as broad zones of low-grade, gold-pyrite, and telluride mineralization that is microfracture-controlled and disseminated, and as fracture zones containing high-grade gold-silver. Both types of mineralization are associated with potassium-feldspar + pyrite +/- carbonate alteration. Subsequent weathering and oxidation of the mineralization averaging approximately 120 meters depth, and extending deeper along major structures, is important in making the deposit amenable to heap leaching.

Information Regarding CC&V All information related to CC&V's 2024 operating guidance, Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources and 2024 production and cost guidance is derived solely from Newmont press releases (Newmont Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results; Provides 2024 Outlook for Integrated Company and Newmont Announces 2023 Mineral Reserves for Integrated Company of 136 Million Gold Ounces with Robust Copper Optionality of 30 Billion Pounds) both dated February 22, 2024 (the Newmont Disclosures). You should closely review the Newmont Disclosures in their entirety to learn about the risk, considerations and qualifications to which this information is subject. We have not independently verified the information derived from the Newmont Disclosures. These historical estimates (as such term is defined in National Instrument 43-101 “ Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Properties (NI 43-101)) are provided solely for information purposes and have not been independently verified by SSR Mining. These historical estimates should not be treated as SSR Mining's current estimates of Mineral Reserves or Mineral Resources at CC&V. Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources information are based on a gold price assumption of $1,400 per ounce for Mineral Reserves and $1,600 per ounce for Mineral Resources. Newmont has not prepared a technical report summary in accordance with the requirements of Subpart 1300 under Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or a technical report in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101, and Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves have not been calculated in accordance with NI 43-101. As a result, the production estimates made by SSR Mining are based on the Newmont Disclosure and have not been prepared, reviewed or verified by an independent, third-party qualified person as set forth in Subpart 1300 or NI 43-101 and SSR is not treating the historical estimate as current Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves for purposes of Subpart 1300 or NI 43-101. The Carlton Tunnel is a historical dewatering tunnel that was constructed from 1939 to 1941 and is one of a series of dewatering tunnels used to dewater CC&V. The tunnel is approximately 10 kilometers long and sits at an elevation of approximately 7,000 feet above sea level. The Carlton Tunnel and mine workings have not been entered or maintained since the late 1980s, when underground mining activities in the district were ceased. The outflow from the Carlton Tunnel portal runs through a series of settling ponds before it flows into Fourmile Creek.

AISC per payable ounce of gold is a non-GAAP financial measure to assist in understanding the acquisition of CC&V. Non-GAAP financial measures are referenced by the Company to assist in the measurement of operating and economic performance and to assist in decision-making, as well as to provide key performance information to senior management. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors and other stakeholders will find this information useful to evaluate our operating and financial performance; however, non-GAAP financial measures “ such as AISC per payable ounce of gold “ do not have any standardized meaning. These financial measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP Measure “ All-In Sustaining Costs (AISC) All-In Sustaining Costs (AISC) per payable ounce of gold is a non-GAAP financial measure developed by the World Gold Council to provide transparency into the costs associated with producing gold and provide a standard for comparison across the industry. The World Gold Council is a market development organization for the gold industry. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with GAAP is cost of sales. The Company believes that AISC provides additional information regarding CC&V to better define the total costs associated with production and better understanding of the economics of CC&V's operations and performance as compared to its other mines and other producers. The Company uses cash costs per ounce of precious metals sold and AISC per ounce of precious metals to monitor its operating performance internally. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with GAAP is cost of sales. The Company believes this measure provides investors and analysts with useful information about its underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on its cost structure. The Company also believes it is a relevant metric used to understand its operating profitability. When deriving the cost of sales associated with an ounce of precious metal, the Company includes by-product credits, which allows management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold and silver production. The Company's definition and use of AISC per payable ounce of gold may not be comparable to AISC per payable ounce of gold used by Newmont, as described in the Newmont Disclosures. You are encouraged to review the discussion of AISC per payable ounce of gold included in the Newmont Disclosures, including a reconciliation to cash costs, the most comparable GAAP measure. The disclosures related to AISC per payable ounce of gold in the Newmont Disclosures provide important information, including how Newmont calculates AISC per payable ounce of gold for CC&V. Following the Acquisition, the Company may not calculate AISC per payable ounce of gold for CC&V in a manner that is consistent with the methodology described in the Newmont Disclosures. This press release also includes references to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP is cash provided by (used in) operating activities. The Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP, certain investors and analysts use free cash flow to evaluate the ability of the Company to generate cash flow after capital investments and build the Company's cash resources. The Company calculates free cash flow by deducting cash capital spending from cash generated by operating activities. The Company does not deduct payments made for business acquisitions. Realized Cash Calculation The following table provides a calculation of realized cash for Marigold since acquisition on April 4, 2014, through September 30, 2024: (in thousands of US dollars) Marigold Revenue $3,450 Cost of Sales ($1,930) Exploration and Evaluation Expenditures ($100) Capital Expenditures ($590) $830 Taxes (i) ($110) Realized Cash After Taxes $720 (i) Represents federal and state taxes paid since acquisition View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241205981031/en/ E-Mail: invest@ssrmining.comPhone: +1 (888) 338-0046 Source: SSR Mining Inc.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 06 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 06 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

NYSE American: UEC CASPER, Wyo., Dec. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSE American: UEC) (the "Company" or "UEC") is pleased to announce the completion of the previously announced (September 23, 2024) agreement with Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) America Inc. ("Rio Tinto") to acquire 100% of Rio Tinto's Wyoming assets, comprised of the wholly-owned and fully-licensed Sweetwater Plant and a portfolio of uranium mining properties, including the Red Desert Project and the Green Mountain Project, with approximately 175 million pounds of historic resources(1) (the " Transaction (JO:TCPJ)"). The purchase price paid was approximately $175.4 million in cash and was funded with UEC's available liquidity. Amir Adnani, President and CEO, stated: "The Transaction presents a rare opportunity to acquire U.S. licensed facilities and uranium mining properties from a leading global miner. These assets will significantly enhance and accelerate UEC's production capabilities in Wyoming's Great Divide Basin. The Sweetwater Plant, a 3,000-ton-per-day processing mill with a licensed capacity of 4.1 million pounds U3O8 annually, can also be adapted to recover uranium from loaded resins produced by In-Situ-Recovery ("ISR") operations, offering UEC the flexibility to support both ISR and conventional mining. With the addition of the Sweetwater Plant, UEC has the largest licensed production capacity in the U.S. The recent investments in nuclear power by Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META), demonstrates unprecedented interest from several of the world's largest and most sophisticated companies in expanding America's nuclear energy baseload capacity. These companies fully realize nuclear power is a key source of highly reliable, clean and safe energy to power the increased energy demands required by AI computing. As the largest U.S.-based uranium company, UEC will play a critical role in supplying the fuel required for today and the future “ a point further underscored by Russia's recently announced uranium export restrictions." Transaction Highlights:Creates UEC's Third U.S. Hub-and-Spoke Production Platform;Acquisition of a Highly Invested Asset Base with Operating Synergies; Combined U.S. licensed production capacity of 12.1 million pounds of U3O8 per year;Drives Sizeable and Accretive Resource Growth; Unlocks Significant Scarcity Value and Production Optionality; andAdds Extensive Land Package, Geological Data and Exploration Opportunities. The Company's next steps for the acquired asset portfolio include (1) completing a SEC Regulation S-K 1300 ("S-K 1300") technical resource summary report to upgrade and confirm historic estimates, (2) building out a dedicated team to focus on advancing the Sweetwater hub-and-spoke production platform, and (3) refurbishing parts of the Sweetwater Plant and completing equipment modifications for In-Situ Recovery processing. About the Red Desert Uranium Project The Red Desert Project is a development-stage uranium project, encompassing approximately 20,005 acres of exploration and mining rights in the Great Divide Basin, including 17,750 acres of unpatented mining claims, 1,975 acres of patented lands and 1,280 acres of state uranium leases. Between three deposits, historic uranium resources are estimated at approximately 42 million pounds of U3O8 .(1) There is potential for further discoveries, particularly in the shallow mineralization adjacent to the Sweetwater Plant. The deposits are favorable for ISR mining, with uranium hosted below the water table at depths suitable for oxygen dissolution, and in fluvial sands confined by low permeability silts or clays. About the Green Mountain Uranium Project The Green Mountain Project is a development-stage uranium project located 22 miles north of the Sweetwater Plant. The project spans approximately 32,040 acres of exploration and mining rights, including 29,400 acres of unpatented mining claims, 640 acres of patented lands and 2,000 acres of state uranium leases. Between five deposits, historic uranium resources are estimated at approximately133 million pounds of U3O8 .(1) Desert View and Whiskey Peak have large areas that have been identified as having good potential for ISR mining, whereas the other deposits are considered appropriate for conventional mining. About the Sweetwater Plant The Sweetwater Plant is a 3,000 ton per day conventional processing mill with a licensed capacity of 4.1 million pounds of U3O8. It is located approximately 40 miles northwest of Rawlins and 75 miles northeast of Rock Springs, Wyoming. Access to the mill is via 30 miles of paved road from US Highway 287 to the east of the site. The fully licensed mill operated from 1981 to 1983 and has been kept under diligent care and maintenance since then. It is the only conventional processing mill in Wyoming. The plant has considerable infrastructure in place, including well-maintained buildings and equipment, a wash bay, warehouse, workshop, offices, access road and utilities. There is potential for the plant to be adapted for the recovery of uranium from loaded resins produced by ISR operations, subject to obtaining any necessary modifications to permits and licenses.Note:1.Based upon internal studies and other historic data prepared by prior owners in regards to the projects and dated between 1984 and 2019. Such estimates are being treated by the Company as historical in nature and a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates as current mineral resources. The Company is not treating them as current resource estimates and is disclosing these historic estimates for illustrative purposes and to provide readers with relevant information regarding the projects. In addition, such estimates were not prepared under S-K 1300 standards and the results of future estimates by the Company may vary from these historic estimates.Advisors and CounselGoldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS). LLC and Rothschild & Co acted as financial advisors to UEC in connection with the Transaction. Holland & Hart LLP and McMillan LLP acted as its legal advisors. About Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE:UEC) Uranium Energy Corp is America's largest and fastest growing supplier of uranium needed to produce safe, clean, reliable nuclear energy. UEC is advancing the next generation of low-cost, environmentally friendly ISR mining uranium projects in the United States and high-grade conventional projects in Canada. The Company has two production-ready ISR hub and spoke platforms in South Texas and Wyoming. These two production platforms are anchored by fully operational Central Processing Plants ("CPPs") and served by seven U.S. ISR uranium projects with all their major permits in place. In August 2024, production began at the Christensen Ranch project in Wyoming, sending uranium loaded resin to the CPP at Irigaray (Wyoming hub). Additionally, the Company has diversified uranium holdings including: (1) one of the largest physical uranium portfolios of U.S. warehoused U3O8; (2) a major equity stake in Uranium Royalty Corp . (TSX:URC), the only royalty company in the sector; and (3) a Western Hemisphere pipeline of resource stage uranium projects. The Company's operations are managed by professionals with decades of hands-on experience in the key facets of uranium exploration, development and mining.

(Photo by Nam NGUYEN / AFP) (Photo by NAM NGUYEN/AFP via Getty Images) Nvidia has been the poster child of the AI boom, with its stock surging by over 180% this year, pushing its valuation to close to $3.4 trillion. Nvidia’s revenues are on track to more than double this fiscal year led by surging demand for its GPUs which have become the de facto chips for AI applications. In contrast, Intel stock has had a tough year. The stock remains down by about 50% year-to-date and has a market cap of a mere $100 billion. Intel’s revenues are expected to contract this year. But here’s the twist: This might be the right time to rethink the AI bellwether. Why is that? Also see a crypto mover that is Up 300% In A Month, XRP Is Just Getting Warmed Up. The markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, they believe that demand for AI accelerators will hold up and Nvidia’s margins and growth rates will remain strong. On the other hand, Intel’s market share losses in the CPU space and its foundry business struggles have made investors pessimistic about its future. However, almost everything in life is cyclical and this couldn’t be more true with the semiconductor markets. Reducing positions in Nvidia and considering Intel stock could be a wise move at this juncture. We explain below - the ‘why’. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Companies have devoted immense resources to building AI models over the last two years or so. Now training these massive models is more of a one-time affair that requires considerable computing power and Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of this, as its GPUs are regarded as the fastest and most efficient for these tasks. This is evident from Nvidia’s recent revenue growth. Sales are on track to expand from a mere $27 billion in FY’23 to almost $130 billion in FY’25. However, the AI landscape may be evolving. As models grow larger in terms of several parameters, incremental performance gains are expected to diminish. Separately, the availability of high-quality data for training models is likely to become a bottleneck. With much of the Internet’s high-quality data already run through by large language models, there could be a shift from large-scale, general-purpose AI models to smaller, specialized models - reducing demand for Nvidia’s high-powered GPUs. The explosive demand Nvidia has witnessed over the last few years may very well have been front-loaded, with future growth very likely slowing. Separately, see What’s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock? Now, AI-related chip demand could shift from training to inference, which is the phase where trained models generate outputs. Inference is less computationally intensive and could open the door for alternative AI processors. To be sure, Nvidia will likely remain the leader by far in the inferencing space as well (it says that inferencing accounts for about 40% of its data center chip demand) but there’s certainly an opening from rivals such as AMD and potentially even Intel to gain a bit of market share. During the initial wave of generative AI, enterprises and big tech companies scrambled to invest in GPUs due to the “fear of missing out,” without worrying about costs and returns on investments. This led to a surge in pricing power for Nvidia, with its net margins coming in at over 50% in recent quarters. However, companies and their investors will eventually look for returns on their investments meaning that they could become more judicious about AI costs going forward and this is likely to hurt margins. Moreover, besides rivals such as AMD and Intel, Nvidia’s biggest customers such as Google and Amazon are doubling down on building their own AI chips. On Tuesday, Amazon announced plans to build an AI ultracluster, essentially a massive AI supercomputer that will be built using its proprietary Trainium chipsets. This could also pose a risk to Nvidia’s business. While the narrative around Nvidia has been the AI boom, the pessimism around Intel has been due to its foundry business. The business has posted sizable losses ($7 billion operating loss in 2023) and has also faced a tech handicap versus industry leader TSMC. However, the division is poised for a potential comeback with its newest 18A process node. This technology, featuring RibbonFET transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, promises significant improvements in terms of performance and efficiency. Intel has already secured contracts with major players like Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defense for custom chip designs using the 18A process. Intel has achieved some key technical milestones with this process and the company expects external customers to move their first 18A designs into production in 2025. If Intel successfully executes this transition, it could shift the narrative around its foundry business. See why 2025 Could Be Intel Stock’s Comeback Year for an in depth look at how Intel stock could be re-rated higher. Moreover, with Donald Trump set to return to the White House in 2025, Intel’s extensive U.S. manufacturing footprint is also likely to emerge as a much more valuable asset. Trump’s focus on boosting domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains could translate into favorable policies for Intel. Potential tariffs on foreign-made chips or incentives for domestic production could give Intel a competitive edge, particularly in its foundry division. Moreover, Intel’s status as the only U.S.-based semiconductor company that designs and manufactures leading-edge chips positions it well to win more Federal government contracts. Intel stock trades at a reasonable valuation at just 23x consensus 2025 earnings. The 2025 earnings estimate is in fact depressed versus historical levels, at just about $1 per share on account of Intel’s current struggles. For perspective, Intel has reported earnings of close to $2 per share in 2022 and earnings of over $5 per share over 2021 and 2020. This means that if Intel sees earnings recover to historical levels in the coming years, the stock could similarly follow suit. The company is expected to return to revenue growth in 2024, with consensus estimates pointing to a 6% revenue increase and there are multiple tailwinds in both the chip and foundry business. Intel’s improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. Intel could also see incremental upside in the AI processor space with its Gaudi 2 and upcoming Gaudi 3 AI accelerators. While Nvidia has returned outsized gains, in contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Nvidia, on the other hand, trades at a lofty 48x projected FY’25 earnings. While Nvidia has seen impressive growth recently, it remains to be seen if the good times will last. And at the current valuation, we see little room for error. The risks we highlighted above could put Nvidia’s future growth and margins at risk, weighing on the company’s earnings. As the AI market shows signs of evolving, investors could see better risk-adjusted returns by moving from Nvidia to more undervalued semiconductor players like Intel. Considering the above factors, Intel may have only one way to go and that’s probably up. For Nvidia, on the other hand, things could get a bit more tricky.

Emerging as the best performers in year-to-date stock performance, some firms demonstrate amazing expansion across the US exchanges. We are just a few weeks away from the end of the year, so it is time to observe the amazing development of these strong performers and grasp, thanks to the most recent news, why they are doing so well. Among them are AppLovin Corp., (APP, Financials), NVIDIA Corp., (NVDA, Financials), Constellation Energy Corp., (CEG, Financials), The Trade Desk (TTD, Financials), and Arm Holdings (ARM, Financials). Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. AppLovin Corp., with a market capitalization of $100 billion and a rise from $11 to $320, has seen an incredible surge in stock price, 754.68%. Particularly in terms of user acquisition and in-game advertising revenue enhancement, the company's AI-powered platform, Axon, has proved indispensable in helping app developersespecially in the gaming sector. AppLovin's Q3 2024 numbers also amply demonstrate its financial success: adjusted EBITDA surged by 72% while income grew by 39%. This year the company is especially exceptional as it can optimize ads using artificial intelligence. NVIDIA Corp. has also exhibited rather remarkable success with its shares rising 179.95% YTD. Rising demand for the company's artificial intelligence chipsbig consumers like Elon Musk's xAI anticipating to employ up to a million NVIDIA GPUs, maybe totalizing $32 billion in expenditurehas fuelled its expansion. Alliances like Amazon's AWS, estimated to spend over $20 billion on NVIDIA chips in 2024, help to further support NVIDIA's market leadership. In June 2024, NVIDIA's market valuation topped $3 trillion, thus attesting to its dominance in the AI hardware sector and so raising investor confidence. Constellation Energy Corp. has focused on growing its portfolio of renewable energy sources by greatly funding solar and wind projects, with a YTD growth of 113.52%. These expenses have been made to meet increased demand for eco-friendly energy solutions in accordance with more broad industry trends toward sustainability. Constellation has also acquired many renewable energy businesses, therefore boosting its capacity and market share in the sector of clean energy. The Trade Desk has also been really outstanding with an 87.83% YTD increase. The company has added innovative artificial intelligence technology into its platform, therefore improving the measurement and targeting capabilities of digital advertising, which has attracted more business. Strategic partnerships with large media companies have enhanced The Trade Desk's access to premium ad inventory even further, therefore enhancing its market stance. Arm Holdings recorded an 86.76% YTD increase after its successful September 2023 IPO, therefore valuing the company at $54.5 billion and raising $4.87 billion. Arm maintains leading in the area of chip design by developing innovative semiconductor technologies, therefore preserving its competitive advantage. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Title: The Concord episode of Secret Level is like a message from a ghost whose unfinished business is creating a global multimedia franchise

The defunct multiplayer shooter speaks from the afterlife in Amazon's upcoming videogame-themed anthology series. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Sometime before Sony hero shooter Concord released, before it was even fully revealed to the public, the producers of Amazon TV series Secret Level—a collection of animated videogame shorts premiering on Prime Video on December 10—started working on an episode based on the game. They didn't know that the short sci-fi tale they were animating would become a message from beyond the grave. The episode, which I've seen in advance of the show's premiere, was supposed to come out in a world where Concord was, if not a Helldivers 2-level hit, a popular and well-liked game. In reality, Concord barely lasted a week. Sony quickly shut the competitive multiplayer game down due to lack of interest, and then shuttered developer Firewalk Studios, which it had acquired partway through Concord's development. I played Concord and I thought it was fun enough, and it was technically sound, but its Bungie-influenced arena shooter stylings just didn't draw a crowd, and neither did its all-in commitment to building a Guardians of the Galaxy-like sci-fi universe with weekly cutscenes. They were going to follow the exploits of a crew of Freegunners—Concord's name for its roguish space mercenaries—whose realistically-rendered faces were a little uncanny. The Secret Level episode portrays the most important moment in the history of the Freegunners, when a heroic crew of outlaws stole a map of navigation routes that allow free travel through the galaxy for enemies of The Guild, a powerful policing body. At the end of the short adventure, we jump to a space pub in the present of Concord's timeline, where the legendary story has just been retold. There, we glimpse the arm of one of Concord's mascots—Lennox, the green guy—and of course we're supposed to think, 'Hey, I know that guy!' But no one does know much about the character, outside of his creators. What we got of Concord's story from the first trailers and cutscenes tell us that he's a daredevil who really loves hot sauce, but there were supposed to have been over a dozen more in-game cinematics by now. The episode comes across like a transmission from a spirit that doesn't know it's dead yet, one that still believes everything went right for Concord and the new game studio. It's the 13th episode of the series—unlucky, eh?—and it'll drop on December 17, although I found its eerie context more notable than the short story itself. Concord is far from the only multiplayer game—or game in general—to struggle or crater this year, although it was the most dramatic impact event. We just learned that Ubisoft isn't going to keep trying to build an audience for free-to-play shooter XDefiant, and it's been an unprecedented year for studio closures and layoffs. More than 300 developers lost their jobs just this week, and thousands more jobs were cut this year. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As for the rest of Secret Level, we watched and rated each episode and liked some of them, but on the whole, the animated shorts didn't charm us much. Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call "boomer shooters" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!). Tyler joined PC Gamer in 2011, and today he's focused on the site's news coverage. His hobbies include amateur boxing and adding to his 1,200-plus hours in Rocket League. Secret Level review: our take on every episode of Amazon's videogame anthology show The creators of Secret Level say Bandai Namco encouraged them to do 'whatever we want' with an iconic character: 'We would like audiences to wonder what the f**k they did with Pac-Man' First it was Counter-Strike, now it's GTA RP: Fortnite unveils LEGO Fortnite Brick Life, a 'social roleplay experience in the Lego Fortnite world' PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
