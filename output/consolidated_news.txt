(NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until July 21, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. Captioned Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc., No. 25-cv-04332 (S.D.N.Y.), the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit charges DoubleVerify as well as certain of DoubleVerify’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-doubleverify-holdings-inc-class-action-lawsuit-dv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify provides media effectiveness platforms. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where DoubleVerify’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (ii) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (iii) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted DoubleVerify’s profits; (v) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 28, 2024, DoubleVerify issued lower revenue growth expectations for the first quarter of 2024 due to “a slow start by brand advertisers and a slow ramp by recently signed” customers. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 21%, according to the complaint. Then, on May 7, 2024, as the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges, DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook due to customers that were pulling back on their ad spending. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell nearly 39%, according to the complaint. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending, and defendants further disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting DoubleVerify. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 36%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired DoubleVerify common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit.

Title: Book Review: Stephen Witt’s Take On Nvidia, ‘The Thinking Machine’

ByJohn Tamny ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 18: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the ... More Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The world becomes more amazing by the day. The surest evidence of the previous assertion is that wealth inequality continues to soar. Yes, you read that right. Inequality is a wonderful thing opposite the apologetic tone about it taken by left and right. Members of the left plainly disdain it, while members of the right claim it doesn’t exist in the way the left imagines, that thanks to transfer payments (yes, wealth redistribution by government) inequality isn’t that “bad.” Except that it’s not bad. It’s great. How could remarkable achievements that power wealth creation be bad? If someone comes up with a cure for paralysis, will readers demand that the cure never reach the marketplace lest the creator grow rich? The beautiful, freedom-infused meaning of wealth inequality came to mind while reading Stephen Witt’s new book, The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World’s Most Coveted Microchip. Nvidia co-founder Huang was already billionaire bracket rich when Nvidia was largely a company popular with gamers, but it’s been Nvidia’s central role in the rise of AI that will increasingly do and think for us in ways that will propel billions into amazing work they can’t not do, that has resulted in Huang achieving centi-billionaire status. Thank goodness for inequality. It signals stupendous, life-enhancing improvement. Huang was already a relentless worker, but it was in 2014 when employee Bryan Catanzaro truly opened Huang’s eyes to the possibilities of AI, and Nvidia’s potential to lead it. After that, and in the words of Witt, “there was only work” for Huang. “There was only AI.” As Huang saw it, AI was “O.I.A.L.O.,” a once in a lifetime opportunity. Huang had the best talent, and he would use it to usher in a future where machines yet again think in addition to doing. Per Witt, the new software “can speak like a human, write a college essay, solve a tricky math problem, provide an expert medical diagnosis, and cohost a podcast.” And that’s just the early stuff. To read Witt is to find out that the known with AI has pedestrian qualities relative to what remains unknown, and even better, what’s not yet been discovered. Markets are a look into the future, equity prices in particular, and Witt quotes Nvidia employee Bas Aarts as saying about what’s known only to those in the proverbial arena, that it’s of the “Wow, I cannot believe this is possible in this age” variety, that “people are oblivious about what is already going on. People have no clue” about the amazing leaps on the way. There’s your inequality. It’s once again born of making the world so much better. The bet here is that AI will unearth human achievement that will render the poorest parts of Africa prosperous, all the while unearthing human flourishing globally that will make the abundant, incredibly prosperous, and – yes – beautifully unequal present appear Bangladesh poor and relatively wealth equal by comparison. Which requires a pause. Just as everyone reads a different book, everyone reviews the same book differently. The review you’re about to read is being written by someone who hasn’t a faint clue about how to “back up” a computer, “upload” a medical form, or even connect a laptop to a printer. This is a way of saying in advance that while Witt’s book is heavy on technical jargon of the CPU, GPU, and CUDA variety, this review will largely focus on the presumed meaning of Nvidia’s ascent to one of the world’s most valuable and most important corporations. Some will ask what’s the point of reading a review of a book about the man and corporation behind a remarkable technological leap since the writer is a technical dolt. It’s a fair point, but one that arguably misses the point. That’s because it doesn’t take someone technologically proficient to grasp the brilliance of work divided across as many hands, machines, and mechanical minds as possible. Even better, it’s not unreasonable to suggest that the mechanized technological genius that’s here and that’s on the way will render the technological illiterates of today the technologists of tomorrow exactly because so much formerly done by humans will be handled by machines. Time will tell. For now, it’s best to start with gratitude for the opposite thinkers. Huang is clearly one of them. Witt writes in the book’s introduction that he’s setting out to tell “the story of a stubborn entrepreneur who pushed his radical vision for computing for thirty years.” As is frequently stated here, there’s no “majoring” in entrepreneurialism simply because no one chooses to be an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurialism is a state of mind, it’s a path certain individuals can’t not take. It’s not planned because it’s not obvious. Furthermore, if it were obvious it wouldn’t be entrepreneurial, and it wouldn’t be entrepreneurial simply because what’s obvious is already being done. To show how outlandish Nvidia’s path was, just look at its valuation along with Huang’s net worth. Oh wow did they ever discover something amazing. Wealth inequality is the measure of this happy truth. Huang as most know is of Taiwanese descent, though his parents (his father was a chemical engineer) sent him and a brother to a boarding school in Kentucky until they arrived. Not a fancy school (though it’s fancier now thanks to Huang), it’s believed Huang’s parents didn’t really know. They perhaps just guessed it was a school full of somebodys instead of one full of misfits. Which on its own is a story. What’s important is that where Huang went to school wasn’t going to matter, nor did it. To his parents, and ultimately him, the U.S. was the goal. Good athletes in the capable sense just need to get here. That's the hard part, while the rest is elevation. When he went off to college, it was Oregon State, not Stanford. In Huang’s words, “I just followed my best friend.” Really, what could school teach him? Genius can’t be taught, which is no insight. Genius was Huang’s parents getting his talents to the United States. The rest was his own invention. How to major in AI since AI wasn’t a thing, or at the very least wasn’t an operable thing when Huang was making his way up. Gaming was primitive. No need. Entrepreneurs create. They invent. Huang and the remarkable talent he cultivated would invent the future, not be told how to do it by some academic. The individual in Bryan Catanzaro whose passion helped spark Huang’s own passion for AI was a humanities major. Hopefully conservatives convinced colleges and universities should pay the federal government back when their graduates don’t thrive read Witt’s book. One’s major is immaterial, particularly in an economy as dynamic as ours. Work that can be taught is, by definition, old news. Out of Oregon State in 1984 Huang secured a job with Advanced Micro Devices. The pay was $28,700/year. Following AMD, Huang went to work for LSI Logic. He rose quickly, and was running a $250 million division when he, along with Sun Microsystems employees Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, decided to pursue what became Nvidia. Even though they were told that the market for PC video gaming hardware was “crowded,” entrepreneurs have evangelical qualities about what they’re doing. Huang clearly did. The bullet-riddled Denny’s where they started making plans for Nvidia is open to this day, and is located at 2484 Berryessa Road in San Jose. Apparently Huang still goes there, and tips in the thousands after ordering all manner of menu items (including chicken fried steak – good taste!) that he eats part of. Huang had even once worked at a Denny’s. Anecdote sucks, but Huang plainly had the immigrant desire to assimilate himself. Of course he did. Conservatives who should know better claim “we” can’t properly assimilate immigrants, but there would never be a need even if there were a real “we” beyond the rhetorical one. Implied in immigration is a desire to assimilate simply because immigration is an expression of a rich-person desire within some of the world’s poorest to increase the value of their labor. Sequoia Ventures, arguably the world’s greatest VC, was along with Sutter Hill the early source of Nvidia’s funds. No less than Don Valentine (Cisco Systems, among others) told Huang after his subpar pitch that “Wilf Corrigan says I have to fund you, so you’re in business.” Corrigan was the head of LSI. He saw up close that Huang was going places. Notable about Nvidia is that it started strong. It’s NV1 chip for video gamers sold in the 100,000 range, and as sales grew so did Nvidia. The problem was that the chips soon enough stopped selling, and their prices were lowered. In Huang’s words about Nvidia’s beginnings, “Every single decision we made was wrong.” Which is an economics lesson on its own. Nvidia’s “recession” was the recovery, or would-be recovery from an NV1 error seen as “catastrophic.” When governments fight recessions they dampen the recovery. That’s the truth about the Great Depression that still eludes 99.99999% of economists. So bad were things from 1993-96 at Nvidia that Valley graphics expert David Kirk made his contract employment there contingent on receiving a paper check every week. Stock options were not an option. Amid all this, including another failed chip, the sign went up at headquarters about how “our company is thirty days from going out of business.” Recessions signal recovery since recessions are when errors are fixed. Huang and Nvidia’s troubled times of old are useful as a way of exposing some of the many fallacies that inform “economics.” For one, there’s a view that won’t die among economics types that the Fed funds rate is the cost of credit. Oh please. There wasn’t a number high enough in the mid-1990s to properly compensate a lender to Nvidia. Except that it wasn’t just that the loan market was shut to Nvidia. Equity finance was a non-starter too as evidenced by Kirk’s demand for actual paper checks over stock options. It all asks readers to contemplate again why Huang is so rich today. It’s so easy to say that he’s that way because he’s a co-founder of Nvidia, but that’s the point. It’s too easy. The better explanation is that few initially wanted Nvidia’s shares. There’s quite simply no such thing as “easy money,” but since there isn’t, Huang almost certainly has more shares than he otherwise would. But that only tells part of the story. In January of 1999 Nvidia went public, but consider the year: 1999. When did you, the reader, first hear of Nvidia? If you own shares, when did you buy them? It’s worth asking mainly because of those who owned Nvidia shares in 1999, it’s no wild speculation that most don’t own those same shares today. It would have been too gut-wrenching for the average bear. Witt reports between the summer of 2001 and the fall of 2002, Nvidia shares lost 90 percent of their value. While Nvidia became part of the S&P 500 after replacing Enron in 2001, and while Huang was briefly a billionaire that same year, Witt notes that Nvidia’s shares didn’t just decline 90%, but that “It would fourteen years before he [Huang] saw that much money again.” To have kept faith in Nvidia on the way to enjoying enormous upside, the typical shareholder would have held on through some rough times, including 2006 when Nvidia’s shares dropped 90 percent once again. Witt quotes one tech pundit as writing amid the 2006 collapse that “For a long time, we have wondered when Nvidia’s abject stupidity would have a price.” Stop and think about that. Or re-read it while thinking more about why Huang is so rich. He believed deeply when few did. It's a reminder that with extraordinary wealth that spurs so much inequality handwringing, it’s perhaps better to think about the unseen. This is particularly useful with Nvidia since Huang, though known to have a “terrifying” temper, was also loathe to fire employees. He yelled them into line with his “cathartic” rants that he was very public about. Ok, but how many left after a tirade, or another dip in Nvidia shares, or because a “better” company like Intel offered them a job. How many individuals walked away from billion-dollar fortunes? One long-time Nvidia employee, Dwight Dierks, sold some shares right after the float in 1999 to buy his father a car. When he describes it as a “billion-dollar-Cadillac” in joking fashion, there’s serious reality underlying the joke. Since going public in 1999, Nvidia shares are up 300,000%. Which is the point, but perhaps not the expected point. It’s so easy to say how foolish it was for early Nvidia employees to leave, or for co-founder Curtis Priem to sell all of his founders shares for hundreds of millions from 2004-2006 when they would be worth $100 billion+ today, but as evidenced by how much departed employees and founders like Priem could have made, Huang pulled off the miracle of miracles. There’s no other way to explain the would have, could have been fortunes. Naturally individuals sold, quit, left, came back, left again, and all sorts of actions unrelated to amassing shares that, by virtue of their miraculous climb, were never supposed to climb this high. In Huang’s case, and amid the occasional costly stumble rooted in his relentless investment “in speculative technologies that would either revolutionize computing or flop,” the future was far from certain. Exactly because any successful chip was immediately a target for imitation, Huang had to keep seeing ahead. In his own words, “If we don’t reinvent computer graphics, if we don’t reinvent ourselves, and we don’t open the canvas for the things we can do,” we “will be commoditized out of business.” Imagine the pressure of having to constantly see around the proverbial corner, while knowing full well the brutal market reaction that awaits after the inevitable mistake. It all speaks to the entrepreneurial mind. And this includes people like Elizabeth Holmes who tragically sit in jail for believing so deeply in her vision. Never asked by Holmes’s myriad critics is why, assuming she knew she was committing fraud, she never sold any of her shares. There was a huge and very liquid market for private shares, yet Holmes held on to hers. It’s that state of mind thing again. It’s why the unequal are unequal. Huang held on, and did so through incredibly difficult stretches that included him fighting to keep his job. The unequal believe in themselves, and they don’t lose faith as others are expressing their lack of faith through share sales. Again, much more interesting than the billionaires minted by Nvidia would be those that weren’t because they sold, exited, or both too soon. Which was once again logical. Witt is clear that earnings represented to Huang the chance to try something new. Rather than pivot toward the obvious, Huang was routinely searching for the “zero-billion-dollar market,” as in the market that’s not yet there. Is it any wonder that truly entrepreneurial visions are rejected by nearly everyone, and most notably the existing commercial successes? Writing about Huang, Witt indicates that he seemed to find comfort in markets “that only he would participate in – one that only he would even see.” Huang indicates to this day that Intel isn’t nor was it ever a competitor. Nvidia was yet again in search of the "zero-billion-dollar” markets that Intel wasn’t interested in, but that Huang was. And is. He saw things and sees things. Very interesting in consideration of Nvidia’s wild ride was the talent that Huang lured into the fold. Keep in mind that this is Silicon Valley, which means the most ferocious battle of all is the ongoing one for talent. Yet despite Nvidia’s scary ups and downs on the way to arguably the world’s most important company, “Nvidia employees were unabashedly elitist.” It was a known that Nvidia was full of talent, which says so much about Huang. With sharks all around him trying to poach the most crucial capital of all, Huang managed to maintain a very deep bench. Terrifying as he could be, Witt notes that almost all of existing and former Nvidia employees interviewed by him “had a tender story about Huang to relate.” What fun it would be to follow him around for a day, or days. And not just Huang. A company this dynamic is logically dense with characters. There’s Bill Dally, who dropped out of high school given an aversion to sitting through history class, became an auto mechanic, but ultimately got a BA at Virginia Tech, a Masters from Stanford, and a PhD from MIT. Dally had options, including Intel, and was told he was “crazy” for not taking an Intel job that surely more than a few Nvidians (?) did. There was John Nickolls who always yelled instead of talking. Witt notes that Nickolls “had no interest in video games at all,” but was passionate about proving Moore’s Law wrong. He did. Nvidia did. Cancer ultimately took Nickolls way too early, but to read about him was to want to ask him (or others in the Nvidia orbit) if he felt the mechanization of knowledge and thought might eventually save him from the cancer that existing medicine couldn’t. Alex Krizhevsky didn’t work for Nvidia, but he trained neural nets to see and think. By his actions, this soft-spoken Ukrainian immigrant conveyed to all manner of academics that (per Witt) “they had so far wasted their careers” on beliefs that Krizhevsky discredited with a week’s worth of “training,” and enormous amounts of electricity used in the training. Krizshevsky oversaw a giant leap, one indicating that “if you could teach computers to see, you could teach them everything.” Of course, in writing what was just written it’s almost certain that all sorts of things were mangled in the telling. But that’s surely the point. And it’s why the AI advances elicit so much optimism in your reviewer. AI isn’t a threat to humanity, rather it will elevate humankind in ways too grand to describe. Is there a way to say how it will reveal its genius? Certainly not. If there was a way to know what’s ahead, then those who know would be billionaires for knowing. All we know, or should know, is that it will be brilliant. Think of the pin factory Adam Smith entered in the 18th century. One man working alone could maybe produce one pin per day, but several men working together could produce tens of thousands. Multiply the latter hundreds of thousands of times over with AI as technology thinks and does as though thousands and millions of brilliantly skilled individuals are at work. Oh, to be born today. Or fifty years from now. Surprisingly, Witt expresses fear throughout the book that AI could have evil qualities, but in the words of Huang, “In order to be a creature, you have to be conscious.” AI will lift humans to the best versions of themselves precisely because it will enable specialization that will have more and more of us working all the time not because we have to, but because we want to. In a very real sense, the AI that has been authored by the remarkable chips created by Nvidia will turn the world’s workers into Nvidia’s workers. Which will be a beautiful sight to see. Impossibly rich as Nvidia employees are, they’re still coming to work. They can’t not. They work all the time because they love what they’re doing, and they’re in love with discovery. It cannot be stressed enough that progress in life is defined not by what we’re doing and learning, but by what we no longer need to do and learn. That’s why Huang is so right that AI “can only lead to good.” It’s so true. About halfway through The Thinking Machine, Witt quotes AI visionary (and oddly enough, skeptic) Geoffrey Hinton talking about “the uncontainable thrill of sneak previewing embargoed AI technology that would shock the world once unveiled.” Yes! Once again, to be young. There’s no limit to human advance, particularly as production is spread across a soaring number of hands, machines, and thought that’s mechanized. Read Stephen Witt’s book to get a sense of what’s ahead as wealth inequality soars thanks to human flourishing going skyward, but almost as fun, sit back and watch. We haven’t seen this movie before, but it will make all that we’ve seen before seem incredibly bland by comparison.

Title: Agentic’s Real Economic Opportunity: Edge Use Cases
URL: https://blog.starpointllp.com/?p=7005
Time Published: 2025-06-01T17:53:18Z
Full Content:
This blog is a monster 25 pages. Hence the executive summary Transformation seldom starts at the core of an existing market or business, but rather starts in edge use cases of unmet needs and price performance (ie, Innovators Dilemma). Edge UCs may be the biggest economic opportunity for Agentic, organizing hyperlocal, DTC and the food chain to create a new kind of market. If these edge UCs can be addressed in the US, it also greatly expands the global market opportunity as small regional needs resemble the edge. The consumer benefit of this approach is an awareness of the very different “purpose” of agentic platforms vs Amazon or Walmart. Imagine identifying which businesses and service providers could address your needs locally. 1. Strategic Focus on Edge Markets: The primary economic opportunity for Agentic Commerce lies in “edge” use cases (Direct-to-Consumer, hyperlocal, custom goods, circular economy) rather than direct competition with retail giants. These peripheral markets have significant unmet needs and fewer incumbent barriers. 2. Innovator’s Dilemma Application: This approach aligns with the Innovator’s Dilemma, where transformative technologies often incubate in niche areas before disrupting core markets. 3. Core Economic Activity is Market Creation: In these initial stages, the fundamental role of agentic AI is to enable new types of transactions and organize currently inefficient or fragmented markets, effectively creating new economic ecosystems. 4. Key US Edge Segments Identified: 5. Critical Challenges for Platform Operators: 6. Greater Need, Greater Opportunity: Unstructured edge markets have a more profound need for AI-driven orchestration. The significant effort required to build these markets creates substantial and defensible value for successful platform operators. 7. Global Blueprint Potential: Success in organizing US hyperlocal markets can provide a model for expansion into emerging economies (e.g., Africa, LATAM), which often feature similar fragmentation and mobile-first environments. 8. Conclusion: Agentic commerce’s path to scale involves solving complex problems in underserved markets. The “hard work” of market creation in these areas will lead to significant, defensible economic opportunities and a foundation for global impact. Clayton Christensen’s seminal work, “The Innovator’s Dilemma,” provides a compelling framework for understanding existing businesses optimize for serving their existing customer base. They often overlook or dismiss disruptive technologies in niche markets or cater to overlooked customer segments. Competitors attack from below here, addressing unmet needs where current solutions are inadequate, overly complex, or prohibitively expensive. The “unmet need” in these peripheral markets frequently extends beyond the mere provision of a product; it often includes discovery, service, and trust within fragmented and inefficient markets. For instance, the challenge in hyperlocal supply chains is not necessarily a lack of local produce, but the absence of an efficient system to connect producers with consumers at scale (ie farmers’ markets don’t scale). Agentic AI’s capability to orchestrate is not just task execution but comprehensive market orchestration. The “price performance” advantage offered by agentic AI in these scenarios may initially develop not as better price, but rather in lower overall transaction costs (such as search, negotiation, and coordination efforts) across markets with little structure (ie complex, customized, or difficult-to-source goods and services). This price-performance dimension can also be realized through hyper-personalization at scale, a superior value proposition that incumbent players cannot easily replicate. This form of “performance” is redefined as “fit-for-purpose,” where agentic AI excels. New technological innovations are frequently first adopted by established market players to bolster their competitive positions within existing market frameworks. Consequently, Perplexity or other agentic aggregators aggregating demand will encounter substantial resistance. Current stakeholders, including retailers and distributors, actively work to protect their established market shares and customer relationships. As I outlined previously, CMOs today express apprehension regarding the emergence of “another Google”. By initiating operations in edge markets agentic commerce platforms can minimize direct confrontation with entrenched players. This strategy allows the new platform to cultivate its own network effects and refine its value proposition before potentially challenging more fortified market positions. This story illustrates how deeply ingrained relationships, brand value, and expectations shape incumbent behavior and their perception of value. We all know Fortune 500 firms suffer from “organizational inertia,” and fined it difficult to pivot when new technologies emerge that threaten their core business models. Edge markets, by their nature, possess fewer entrenched systems and practices. In these peripheral markets, agentic platforms can strategically reframe their role. Instead of being perceived as disintermediators of strong, existing players, they can position themselves as enablers for underserved small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and individual producers. This strategy should fosters collaboration rather than immediate conflict. For a local artisan, a custom furniture maker, or a hyperlocal farmer struggling with market access and visibility, an agentic platform can offer an invaluable route to market that is currently unavailable. The platform thus becomes an ally, empowering these smaller entities to reach new customers or compete more effectively, rather than posing a direct threat to an established intermediary. This dynamic fundamentally alters the challenge of network building from one of confrontation to one of mutual benefit. IMHO the initial opportunity for agentic commerce lies in the vast, often unorganized, “everything else” economy. These are markets characterized by fragmentation, specificity, and unmet needs that fall outside the purview of mass-market retail. AI-driven agents are uniquely positioned to bring structure, efficiency, and new value to these segments. Today, where do you search for hyperlocal or DTC? The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) model represents one of the most rapidly expanding segments in the retail landscape, with brands connecting with their end customers. This “milk man” approach has found significant traction in e-commerce (ex Warby Parker and Dollar Shave Club), and holds potential in hyperlocal contexts, including fresh produce, bakery items, dairy products, and the inventory of local stores. Projections indicate DTC e-commerce sales in the US were expected to reach $161.22 billion by 2024, underscoring a persistent shift towards direct selling. Further growth is anticipated, with social commerce, a key enabler for DTC, projected to generate over $100 billion in revenue in 2025, a 22% increase from 2024. Agentic commerce can provide structure for DTC by automating and optimizing numerous the DTC journey. This includes highly personalized product discovery and demand generation (distinct from traditional advertising), streamlined order management, and responsive customer service. Such capabilities can significantly lower the barrier to entry for brands to adopt and scale DTC more effectively. Today the challenge often extends beyond merely selling directly; it encompasses managing the entire customer lifecycle and the operational complexities that retailers traditionally handle. Agentic AI can function as an “outsourced operational backbone,” assisting with tasks like autonomous product catalog management, where agents monitor supplier feeds and sales data to keep offerings fresh, and delivering hyper-personalized shopping experiences. This support can empower a new wave of “micro-DTC” brands, particularly for niche and artisanal producers who currently lack the scale, technical expertise, or operational capacity to manage direct selling operations effectively. By radically simplifying the creation and management of these operations, agentic platforms can unlock a vast, currently inaccessible supply from the long tail of producers. Hyperlocal supply chains, particularly for perishable goods such as locally sourced grains, fresh produce, and meats, are frequently characterized by disorganization and inefficiency. Traditional models like farmers’ markets, while valuable for community engagement, lack the scalability and structured to meet broader demand. The global online food delivery market, a significant component of hyperlocal commerce, was projected to see revenues grow from $156.75 billion in 2024 to $173.57 billion in 2025.10 The US food subscription market alone was valued at $150.3 billion in 2024, with a forecasted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% from 2025 to 2032.1 The broader gig economy, which encompasses a wide array of local services, was valued globally at $455 billion in 2025, with the US market segment estimated at $556.7 billion in 2024 and projected to grow to $646.77 billion in 2025, exhibiting a CAGR of 16.18%. These figures underscore the opportunity. A platform capable of aggregating local supply or real-time inventory could focus on enabling consumers to buy locally and orchestrate both the purchase process and the logistics of local delivery. This unmet need extends beyond tangible goods to encompass local services from home maintenance to personal wellness. The hyperlocal market opportunity lies in significantly reducing spoilage and waste, particularly for perishable items, and increasing asset utilization for small service providers. This is achieved through demand forecasting, efficient inventory management, and optimized logistical coordination, all powered by AI. For small local businesses, unsold inventory or unbooked service appointments represent direct losses. AI’s capacity to aggregate demand, predict consumer needs, and streamline fulfillment directly addresses these inefficiencies, converting potential waste into revenue. A hyperlocal agentic platform could catalyze the formation of new “micro-economies.” or at least Micro Markets. By lowering the barriers to entry for supplying goods or services at a local level. This impact transcends mere efficiency gains for existing businesses; it fosters an expansion of the participatory base in local commerce, potentially enhancing local employment and the global economy (see Payments and Expanding the Global Economy). The demand for custom-made products, such as a specialized racing go-kart or a minivan modified for accessibility, and curated experiences frequently involves intricate processes of requirement gathering, iterative design, and the coordination of multiple suppliers or services. The global personalized gifts market serves as a strong proxy for this demand, projected to grow from $31.05 billion in 2025 to $43.5 billion by 2029, with a CAGR of 8.8%.20 Another estimate suggests a $10.76 billion expansion in this market between 2025 and 2029, at a CAGR of 6.7%.21 North America is a significant driver, accounting for 29% of this market and anticipated to be the fastest-growing region.20 Agentic AI can function as a sophisticated project manager or an intelligent personal shopper in this domain. These AI agents can understand nuanced user needs expressed in natural language, source appropriate components or services, facilitate complex design processes, and manage the end-to-end creation and delivery of bespoke products. This includes AI-driven personalization at scale for items that require substantial user input or co-creation, effectively translating vague consumer desires into concrete product specifications and managing multi-step production or assembly workflows. Platforms like “Daydream” allow users to ‘chat to shop’ for fashion using natural language prompts, receiving tailored suggestions rather than infinite options. The role of the agent in the custom goods sector extends beyond simple matching to active co-creation and intricate problem-solving. This is particularly true for items that are not COTS and require a deep understanding design trade-offs, specialized components or modifications. AI stylists, for example, can curate entire outfits rather than just suggesting single items, and AI can facilitate hyper-personalized designs based on user descriptions. In this vein, customization can transition from a luxury niche to a more mainstream offering. A shift that could unlock significant latent demand from consumers who desire personalized products but are currently deterred by the cost or complexity of the customization process. The market for used goods is experiencing rapid expansion, fueled by a combination of economic pressures compelling consumers to seek value and a growing societal emphasis on sustainability. The global resale market was valued at approximately $200 billion in 2023 and is projected to potentially double to $400 billion by 2027. Another analysis indicates the global second-hand products market stood at $186 billion in 2024 and is forecasted to surge to $1.044 trillion by 2035, reflecting a robust CAGR of 17.2% between 2025 and 2035. North America holds 40% share. Agentic AI can significantly enhance marketplaces by improving the listing process through AI-generated descriptions and pricing suggestions derived from minimal inputs like a single photograph, facilitating more efficient discovery of specific items, aiding in the verification of authenticity or condition, and managing the intricacies of transactions or loan agreements. These functions directly address the inherent fragmentation, information asymmetry, and trust deficits prevalent in consumer-to-consumer (C2C) and business-to-consumer (B2C) used goods markets. Many consumers retain items they no longer need and refrain from selling due to the hassle of listing, pricing, shipping, or managing the exchange. By dramatically lowering the friction for suppliers platforms could bring millions of new items into circulation. This represents an expansion of the total addressable market of tradable used goods. Platforms that cover this market also creates a distinction from Amazon, as they engage for a purpose. If the purpose is local, or used its ebay, craigslist or the AI platform.

For instance, aggregating and structuring a highly fragmented supply side, orchestrating a seamless and trustworthy end-to-end customer experience, and defining the governance (ex. return policy). A primary hurdle for agentic commerce platforms aiming to serve edge markets is the effective aggregation and organization of supply from a vast, diverse, and often technologically unsophisticated base of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and individual providers. To construct a functional marketplace, a structured and comprehensive catalog detailing what these myriad small businesses can offer, encompassing products, services, and real-time inventory availability. This necessitates the creation of robust schemas and data structures capable. Edge SMBs often lack people, and standardized for their own business. Or other specialist agents that can go through SMB purchase lists or online product listings. The task of onboarding and continuously updating data from millions of disparate SMBs is formidable and represents a usability and incentive challenge for The solution may lie in AI-driven data ingestion and structuring that minimizes the burden on the SMB, perhaps using Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert unstructured text into structured data attributes, or employing computer vision to extract product features from images. Incentives, such as immediate access to aggregated demand or premium visibility, will be crucial to encourage SMB participation and data sharing. Such a dataset would itself be a competitive barrier. My analogy is Alipay and Taobao as every small business is present in a single giant consumer market. For many critical edge use cases, such as hyperlocal food delivery, local retail inventory access, and the exchange of used goods, real-time inventory data is key for customer experience and fulfillment. Given that SMBs lack sophisticated inventory management systems, Agentic platforms must furnish simple, intuitive tools or seamless integrations that empower SMBs to publish and update their inventory status with minimal effort. In a previous blog, I outlined how all small businesses publish their real time store inventory to Google. Why? Because when you search on outdoor furniture Google local shows “in stock at Crate and Barrell” with measurement to show conversions. Data sharing equals sales, this is the model that Agentic platforms must create. The challenge is not just publishing inventory data; it involves maintaining its accuracy with minimal ongoing effort. Agentic AI systems could address this by learning sales velocities for specific items and proactively prompting updates (e.g., “It appears you may be running low on Product X. Do you still have 5 units in stock?”). Or perhaps integration with Block’s POS to automatically update inventory upon a sale. If accomplished, and aggregator’s visibility across a distributed network of local SMBs could also unlock novel and highly efficient fulfillment models. For instance, an AI agent could orchestrate “hyperlocal Clicks-to-Bricks” fulfillment, where it locates an item at the nearest small store with confirmed availability and arranges for immediate customer pickup or rapid local delivery. Transforming isolated SMBs into a market of interconnected nodes within a dynamic, responsive local supply network, orchestrated by the agentic platform. Beyond supply-side aggregation, agentic platforms face the equally daunting task of managing the entire customer journey, from initial discovery through to fulfillment and post-purchase support. This is particularly complex in decentralized markets populated by numerous small, independent suppliers. Agentic platforms must be capable of guiding users from engagement through the discovery of unique or highly specific items and services, to the delivery and navigate post-purchase scenarios such as returns, exchanges, or complaints. This end-to-end orchestration is challenging within a single domain and even more so in decentralized market with no governance. AI agents will need to coordinate complex logistics, potentially integrating with third-party delivery providers, manage customer expectations regarding timelines and quality, and ensure consistent service levels across a diverse supplier base. AI must also articulate the risk. Who owns it? Can I return my goods? The “orchestration” challenge implies the necessity for AI agents to collaborate with other specialized AI agents or automated systems, such as logistics APIs, payment gateways, customer service chatbots, and inventory management modules. Multi-agent system architectures enable agent specialization within a segment and geography. While product discovery can be approximated by advanced search engines and payment processing is a relatively commoditized function, coordination represents a significantly harder problem to solve at scale. Mastering this orchestration for the “everything else” economy would create unique value, defensible not merely through network effects but through profound operational and AI-driven sophistication. Ensuring consistent product quality, reliable service delivery, and the effective management of exceptions like returns or disputes presents a major hurdle. Unlike integrated retailers such as Walmart, which explicitly stand behind every purchase and manage the associated risks, a decentralized agentic marketplace requires robust mechanisms to build and maintain trust when the platform operator neither owns the inventory nor directly controls the service provision. AI-driven solutions for supplier vetting, ongoing performance monitoring, dynamic reputation systems, secure escrow services, and transparent, integrated dispute resolution processes. Consumer trust in AI agents and the platforms they operate on will depend heavily on the existence of such assurance frameworks and clear recourse mechanisms. Replicating the “Walmart trust factor” in a decentralized market requires platforms to evolve their governance into a trusted guarantor or mediator, even if it does not directly supply the goods or services. For example, AI can analyze supplier reviews, disputes, or historical performance data. As I related, Visa and Mastercard are best placed to define the governance structure of agentic operation across all platforms (a significant 5yr VAS opportunity). The Platform (or V/MA) becomes an enforcer of quality standards and a cornerstone of market trust. The data generated from managing quality, resolving disputes, and tracking supplier performance across a vast network of edge transactions can, in turn, be used to create highly accurate, dynamic “trust scores” for suppliers. These scores, far more nuanced than simple star ratings, become a valuable asset for the platform, a reliable signal for consumers, and a powerful incentive for suppliers to maintain high standards of conduct and service quality. Agentic platforms must not only connect buyers and sellers but also establish the fundamental rules and mechanisms that govern their interactions, particularly concerning pricing, risk allocation, and the overall framework of trust. For the non-commodity goods and services pricing is often not a fixed affair. It can involve dynamic mechanisms such as auctions, formal Request for Proposal (RFP) processes, or bespoke, bilateral negotiations. The Michelin-Ford tire example, where an RFP that failed to specify “brand” led to an initial supply of unbranded tires, underscores the complexity of value assessment beyond simple price points in such transactions. Agentic AI platforms must be architected to support these complex pricing mechanisms. This could involve AI agents capable of participating in, or even autonomously conducting, negotiations on behalf of buyers or sellers as agents take into account factors beyond price: product quality, delivery timelines, supplier reputation, warranty terms, and other non-monetary aspects of a deal. Platforms like Keelvar demonstrate agentic AI autonomously designing and managing sourcing events, while Pactum shows AI agents engaging in autonomous supplier dialogue and agreement finalization. Dynamic, multi-attribute negotiations at scale is an upmarket that could be made available and usable by SMBs. This could lead to more efficient market clearing for unique items and services, where value is assessed holistically rather than on price alone. Sophisticated AI negotiating agents also raises the prospect of new forms of complex market dynamics, including the potential for “algorithmic collusion,” where AI agents, even without explicit programming to do so, learn pricing strategies that lead to supra-competitive outcomes. Such developments would necessitate new regulatory frameworks and oversight mechanisms to ensure market fairness, particularly in markets for unique or essential custom goods and services. As highlighted previously, established retailers like Walmart cultivate consumer trust by explicitly backing every purchase and providing clear avenues for recourse. In a decentralized agentic marketplace, defining who bears responsibility for fulfillment, ensuring product or service quality, and impartially handling disputes is a critical and complex challenge. To compete, platforms must establish market rules leverage AI for comprehensive risk assessment of transactions and suppliers, advanced fraud detection, this is also an area where V/MA can lead as well as facilitation of an efficient dispute resolution processes Examples includ implementing platform-backed guarantees, secure escrow services managed via smart contracts, or specialized insurance mechanisms tailored for agent-mediated commerce. The development of “Agent Passports” or similar identity verification systems for AI agents can also contribute to building trust and accountability within these ecosystems. For end to end assurance a qualification of every participating agent and entity is necessary. This is the “market”.

While the initial investment in terms of effort and resources to establish these markets is more substantial, the potential upside for a successful market maker aligns to their market valuations. Edge markets offer what is effectively a “greenfield” opportunity. Here, new entrants can define the rules of engagement, build powerful network effects from the ground up, and capture significant economic value by bringing order and efficiency to previously chaotic or underserved segments of economic activity. In such contexts, the role of AI transcends incremental improvement, as might be seen in core retail applications, to become one of fundamental enablement and market creation. The “greater need for AI orchestration” within these unstructured markets signifies that AI itself becomes a core, indispensable component of market creation, customer experience and the overall value proposition, not merely an ancillary optimization tool. Platforms that undertake the “hard work” to organize this supply and demand capture a proportionally larger share of the value created in each transaction. This is not a “new kind of search” that competes with Google and Amazon. It is not even eCommerce in the traditional sense. This is enabling a new market and way to coordinate it that only AI can deliver. By handling complex discovery, nuanced negotiation, intricate customization processes, and multi-party logistics coordination, the AI’s contribution to the final transaction value is substantially higher. This justifies a more significant revenue share for the platform that provides this essential orchestration layer. The process of successfully organizing one complex edge market using agentic AI can lead to the development of a reusable “playbook.” This playbook, comprising refined AI models, standardized data schemas, proven trust mechanisms, and effective orchestration logic, can significantly accelerate entry into other, similarly unstructured markets. The “hard operational work” undertaken to structure supply, build robust trust frameworks, and orchestrate fulfillment for, say, custom artisan goods, involves creating specific AI capabilities and market rules. This framework can be reused. Reuse creates powerful economies of scale and scope in the process of market-making itself, allowing the platform to achieve compounding competitive advantages as it expands its footprint across the “everything else” economy. Assuming an agentic US success in hyperlocal, the resultant models, technologies, and operational learnings can serve as a valuable blueprint for expansion into smaller, often mobile-first, markets in emerging economies, such as those found in Africa and Latin America. These markets frequently exhibit highly fragmented local economies, a significant presence of informal sector activities, and a greater dependency on mobile platforms for commerce and communication. These characteristics make them potentially fertile ground for agentic commerce solutions tailored to organize local supply chains—for example, in agriculture, local retail, or the production of artisan goods—and connect them efficiently to existing and new sources of demand.19 This approach would mirror the successes in US hyperlocal markets but would be carefully adapted to the unique socio-economic, cultural, and technological contexts of these regions. The global agentic commerce market, including solutions across retail, payments, and customer service, was estimated between $5-6.7 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $10.41 billion by the end of 2025, with forecasts suggesting it could touch $41-200 billion between 2030 and 2040, indicating substantial global growth potential.76 The potential for “leapfrogging” is particularly pronounced in many emerging markets. Analogous to how mobile telephony bypassed the extensive rollout of landline infrastructure in many developing nations, agentic commerce platforms—optimized for mobile-first interaction and adept at navigating the nuances of fragmented and informal economies—could circumvent the need for the development of traditional, Western-style retail infrastructure. Many emerging markets lack the highly organized retail chains, sophisticated logistics networks, and formalized business structures prevalent in the US.43 If agentic AI can effectively organize informal sellers, smallholder farmers, and local producers—who form the backbone of many economies in Africa and Latin America—and connect them to buyers primarily via mobile interfaces, it can catalyze a new paradigm of commerce that does not depend on massive prior investment in physical infrastructure.72 The deployment of agentic commerce in these emerging markets could also yield significant socio-economic benefits. By empowering small-scale entrepreneurs, local artisans, and agricultural producers with direct access to larger markets, transparent price discovery, efficient operational tools, and potentially integrated financial services (such as micro-payments or escrow facilities accessible via mobile), these platforms can substantially uplift local economies.75 This has the potential to foster more inclusive growth, improve livelihoods, and enhance the resilience of local communities. The trajectory for agentic commerce to achieve significant economic impact and widespread adoption does not lie in pursuing incremental improvements within already optimized, mature markets. Instead, its most profound potential resides in the ambitious endeavor of structuring, organizing, and efficiently serving the vast, underserved “everything else” economy. By strategically focusing on edge use cases characterized by clear unmet needs agentic platforms can sidestep direct confrontation with entrenched incumbents. This approach allows them to concurrently build valuable, defensible networks and cultivate sophisticated AI-driven orchestration capabilities. The sophisticated AI systems honed in these challenging environments, trained on diverse, real-world edge case data and refined through continuous interaction, will establish insurmountable competitive barriers. The established supplier relationships, the nuanced pricing and risk algorithms, and the innovative trust mechanisms will collectively constitute a powerful strategic asset. Ultimately, the economic opportunity extends beyond immediate transactional revenues; it encompasses the creation and ownership of new market infrastructures. The robust capabilities forged in addressing the complexities of US-based edge markets will provide a solid and adaptable foundation for strategic expansion into emerging economies, where the need for such organizational and efficiency-enhancing technologies is often even more acute. By making the long tail of supply accessible, manageable, and efficient, agentic commerce is poised to reshape the contours of commerce on a global scale, unlocking new avenues of value creation for businesses and consumers alike. “ decentralized agentic marketplace requires robust mechanisms to build and maintain trust” You are so right about this Tom. The shift to Agentic is a shift toward the reputation economy. There is no doubt in my mind that new cryptographic techniques – many of them developed for the cryptocurrency world – mean that this now viable without centralised gatekeepers.

Title: Regulations are making homes unaffordable … around the world!

By Joel Kotkin, Wendell Cox, Real Clear Wire June 1, 2025 Next to inflation, Americans ranked housing as their top financial worry in a Gallup survey last May. It’s only gotten worse. January home sales were down 5% from last year’s dismal numbers. Record numbers of first-time buyers are stuck on the sidelines as housing affordability stands at the lowest level ever recorded, while one in three Americans now spend over 30% of their income on mortgage or rent. The housing crisis is not just an American problem, but a global phenomenon that hits the middle and working classes the hardest. Studies of the Canadian, British, European, and East Asian markets have also found that housing prices have risen far faster than household incomes and inflation. A report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development concluded that “housing has been the main driver of rising middle-class expenditure.” In prosperous and communitarian Switzerland, Zurich studios sell for well over $1 million, and small houses even more, making downpayments unaffordable to affluent people despite the overwhelming financial advantages to homeowners. Underlying the plight of home buyers worldwide is a sometimes overlooked but profound influence – the spread of restrictive land-use regulations. It’s reshaping political and economic alignments in ways that may further destabilize the social order. Home ownership is strongly correlated with positive social indicators, and as renting grows twice as quickly as buying, this trend poses a threat to Western democracy by deepening economic inequality, depressing demographic vitality, and undermining the upward mobility that has driven Western progress for the past century.

Cost of Over-Regulation The price increase may seem surprising because there has not been a huge spike in fundamental demand. In California, and most of the United States, as well as Europe and East Asia, population growth is tepid, if not declining. Today’s higher interest rates are below those that prevailed from 1970 to 1995, when housing costs were considerably lower relative to incomes. Nor is this predominantly a technical problem; the rise of remote work, which is connected to migration to smaller metros, as well as new technologies for building, including using 3D printers, actually offers the chance to build more cheaply. And yet, the principal cause for housing shortages and rising prices stems from the failure to build enough new housing units, particularly the single-family homes consumers most desire. Homebuilders built 1 million fewer homes (including rental units) in 2024 than in 1972, when there were 130 million fewer Americans. One estimate puts the U.S. housing market shortage at an estimated 4.5 million homes, according to Commerce Department data. The rapid inflation of housing costs stems primarily from ever more constricting land-use regulations. Inflated prices are particularly rife in countries and states with strict regulations like California, where high-income households now utterly dominate the housing market, and more than a third of all real estate transactions in recent years topped $1 million. At the crux of the problem is a series of housing policies referred to as “urban containment.” First implemented in Britain at the end of the Second World War, urban containment policies typically seek to manage growth by imposing boundaries or greenbelts around urban areas, outside of which new development is either prohibited or severely limited. Decades ago, there was ample land within these boundaries, but this has changed as population growth has stimulated more demand. The simple fact is that once the urban limits are reached, land prices along the boundaries – the suburbs and exurbs – and in the areas still open to development inevitably rise. This mimics the effects of the 1970s gasoline embargoes that drove prices through the roof – and is nothing more than basic economics. Rationing tends to increase prices. To this flawed approach, many jurisdictions have imposed other costs such as high-impact fees, lengthy environmental reviews, minimum parking mandates, and historical preservation designations. But generally, nothing quite compares with urban containment, as it drives up land costs by restricting development on the periphery, where land prices are the lowest. In almost all cases, the highest housing prices occur in markets that are characterized by this planning strategy. This includes all markets in Australia and New Zealand and many in Canada, the United Kingdom, the U.S., Western Europe, and China. In the U.S., the worst housing inflation has been in California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, and Colorado, all states that apply the tightest large regulatory noose around new developments, particularly on and beyond the urban fringe. The connection between policy and prices is clearly evident. As late as 1970, only a few markets were shaped by urban containment. As its influence grew, so did prices. As late as about 1990, national price-to-income ratios were “affordable,” at three or less in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. Today, the median multiple in these countries tends to be over five. But the worst results, as seen in most recent Demographia International Housing Affordability Study – Hong Kong, Sydney, San Jose, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Adelaide, Honolulu, San Francisco, Melbourne, Brisbane, as well as Greater London, are at a remarkable nine or above. Perhaps counterintuitively, higher density development – often seen as the alternative to “sprawl” – does not lower prices, as is sometimes suggested. In fact, U.S. data suggests a positive correlation between greater density and housing costs. Among 53 major metros, those with more single-family housing and larger lot sizes (key indicators of lower density) have substantially better housing affordability. The effects of density-focused policies on people and regions are profound. One study found the median family in San Jose or San Francisco would need 125 years (150 in Los Angeles) to save enough money to afford a down payment on a median-priced home; in Atlanta or Houston, the figure is 12 years. Highly restrictive planning policies also impact renters. A recent RAND study of California found that policy-driven delays, strict architectural standards, green mandates, and the requirement to pay union-level wages have increased the cost of construction of subsidized apartments twice as much as in Texas, while taking almost two years longer to get approved. Portland, Ore., a pioneer in urban containment, embraces high-density housing, but high prices have driven multifamily construction to the lowest level in a decade. Collapse of the Dream Urban containment and other planning policies have devastated middle-class aspirations in every country or region that adopts them, even in countries like Australia, which enjoy a vast land mass and a smallish population. Australian cities once characterized by family-friendly neighborhoods are now dominated by dense apartments and condominiums. Planning regulations now add 55% to the price of a home in Sydney, according to a recent Reserve Bank of Australia study. In greater Sydney, the median home price recently passed A$2 million (approximately US$1.3 million). This is higher relative to incomes than in Los Angeles, London, New York, Singapore, and Washington. Even Adelaide, geographically isolated and far from a dynamic global business locale, has higher prices, based on income, than Seattle, one of the world’s most dynamic tech hubs. According to projections from the Urban Taskforce, apartments will make up half of Sydney’s dwellings mid-century, whereas only one quarter of Sydney dwellings will be family-friendly detached homes. Young people are most impacted by this policy regime. In the U.S., homeownership for people under 35 has fallen fairly steadily since the Great Recession of 2008 and is now half that of people over 45. Similarly, in Australia, the percentage of households aged 25 to 34 owning homes has dropped from more than 60% in 1981 to only 45% in 2016. Similar trends are seen in other high-income countries, including Ireland, where only a third of millennials own a home, compared with almost two-thirds of baby boomers when they were the same age. At least one-third of British millennials are likely to remain renters permanently. Much of the same is occurring in the U.S. Whereas in 1969, the median price of a home cost about five years of a young adult’s income, today it costs nearly nine years. A new Institute for Family Studies report, “Homes For Young Families: A Pro-Family Housing Agenda,” says that since 1970, the share of young adults who own the home they live in has declined from 50% to around 25-30%. Ignoring Preferences In advocating such urban containment and other high-density housing policies, planners, backed by academia and most big media, set themselves against the overwhelming preferences of the public for less density and more spacious housing. Judge Glock, who is now affiliated with the Manhattan Institute, has noted that in Census Bureau data since 1950, the average density of the major continuously built-up urban areas has dropped from 6,000 people per square mile to 3,000. In recent years, smaller metropolitan areas have been growing the fastest, while net domestic migration is away from areas of higher density to areas of lower density. Since 1950, the share of U.S. population in core cities has fallen from 24% to under 15%. Even in California, despite government resistance, virtually all the growth over the last decade has been in farther-flung suburbs. As elsewhere, the preference for single-family homes is “ubiquitous,” according to recent research by Jessica Trounstine at the University of California, Merced. “Across every demographic subgroup analyzed,” she observes, respondents preferred single-family home developments by a wide margin. Relative to single-family homes, apartments are viewed as “decreasing property values, increasing crime rates, lowering school quality, increasing traffic, and decreasing desirability.” Once, it was widely suspected that young people would head to big core cities like New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Denver. But surveys reveal that nearly three in five younger people see homeownership as an essential part of the American dream, while two-thirds favor suburbs as their preferred residence. Three out of four Californians, according to a poll by former Obama campaign pollster David Binder, opposed legislation that banned single-family zoning. A big driver of suburban growth is minorities and immigrants. In the 1950s and 1960s, mass suburbanization was widely associated with “white flight” and discrimination against minorities. But in the past decade, over 90% of all suburban growth in the U.S. came from minorities; currently, more than three-quarters of all African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians in major metropolitan areas in the U.S. live in the suburbs. Similar patterns are also evident in Canada, Australia, and the U.K. Today, most high-income countries are primarily suburban. A Statistics Canada analysis of 2021 census results indicates that more than 75% of the population lives in the suburbs, which absorbed more than 80% of the growth between 2016 and 2021. Even in transit-rich and land-short Japan, residents of Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya are dispersing away from the urban core to suburban and exurban areas after these cities nearly monopolized national population growth over the previous decade. Much the same can be said of Seoul, South Korea, which is even denser than the Japanese megacities. An analysis of the 53 U.S. major metropolitan areas finds that more than 85% of residents live in suburban or exurban neighborhoods and that more than 90% of the population growth since 2010 has been in the suburbs and exurbs. These choices underscore an analysis of Canadian poll results by Sotheby’s, which suggests a “disconnect” between urban planning and consumer preferences: The “picture is of young urban families overwhelmingly preferring detached houses, and decidedly not the condominiums into which planners are driving them.” As Sotheby’s puts it, “The report dispels myths about young, urban families’ housing preferences.” Among Americans under 35 who do buy homes, four-fifths choose single-family detached houses. According to a recent National Homebuilders Association report, over 66%, including those living in cities, prefer a house in the suburbs. Almost two-thirds of U.S. millennials (25 to 44) favor being owners, which is also the case in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The future vision of the planners has little attraction among the public. Upward Mobility or Neo-Feudalism? Whatever their desires, without an affordable home, millennials and Gen Z will face a formidable challenge in boosting their net worth. Homes today account for roughly two-thirds of the wealth of middle-income Americans; homeowners have a median net worth more than 40 times that of renters. Not surprisingly, most young people still believe in creating wealth through ownership. Yet rather than allowing for greater dispersal of wealth, as was the case in previous decades, the decline of housing affordability is a critical factor driving inequality, notes a recent study by Bank for International Settlements (Berne) economist Gianni La Cava. In more historically feudal Great Britain, land prices have risen dramatically over the past decade, and less than 1% of the population owns half of all the land. On the continent, farmland is increasingly concentrated while urban real estate has fallen into the hands of a small cadre of corporate owners and the mega-wealthy. The left-wing economist Thomas Piketty has identified high housing costs as a driver of increasing inequality even in purported social democracies like Germany and France. This is also the case in the U.S., where about 71% of the increase in housing wealth between 2010 and 2020 was gained by high-income households, according to the National Association of Realtors. Increasingly, home ownership relies on the classic feudal formula – being born into “the funnel of privilege.” In the U.S., millennials are three times as likely as boomers to count on inheritance for their retirement. Among the youngest cohort, those ages 18–22, over 60% see inheritance as their primary source of support as they age. In high-price markets like Los Angeles and Orange County, California, close to 40% of loans rely on family money for qualification, up from 25% in 2011. Threat to Democracy Most democratic or republican societies in history – in Athens, Rome, the Netherlands, Britain, France, North America, Oceania – were created and sustained by a broad property-owning middle class. In the twentieth century, middle-class asset growth was accomplished in large part by the expansion of an urban footprint beyond the city core, allowing many more citizens to buy property in spacious, safe environments offering a measure of privacy. The ideal of broadly dispersed property ownership has long been promoted by politicians, both right and left, in most high-income countries. “A nation of homeowners, of people who own a real share in their land, is unconquerable,” said President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He saw homeownership as critical not only to the economy but to democracy and the very idea of self-government. Today, the trend towards democratization of landownership is being reversed, with more and more people being pushed into living in rented apartments or houses, with little chance of gaining financial independence. An economy where most people rely upon wealth transfers from the more fortunate cannot easily coexist with a tradition of individual initiative and self-governance. At the very least, the drive to create lifetime renters and forced densification sets a stage for a future political conflict and social disruption, particularly for the younger generation. In a Harvard poll of 18- to 29-year-olds this year, housing ranked as the third-most important issue overall, after inflation and health care. In California, almost 70% of residents consider housing costs a major concern, while in Britain, housing rose to be one of the top five issues for voters, well ahead of defense, security, poverty, and crime. The housing affordability crisis impacts a host of life decisions. Studies of the U.S. have found that higher house prices had a direct impact on the decision of couples to have children. Research in Germany and across 18 European and North American nations also found that high housing prices defer family formation, leading to lower fertility as well as marriage rates, particularly among the working class. On the flip side, a new study by the Federal Reserve Board reports that homeowners are not only more affluent than renters, they are also physically and mentally healthier, vote more often, and their children achieve higher levels of education. Many advocates of forced densification and renting justify their views around “green” and “sustainability” concerns. The environmental magazine Grist has envisioned “a hero generation” that will escape the material trap of suburban living and work that engulfed their parents. One magazine editor proudly declared herself a part of the GINK generation (as in “green inclinations, no kids”) that she said meant not only a relatively care-free and low-cost adult life, but also “a lot of green good that comes from bringing fewer beings onto a polluted and crowded planet.” Less motivated by planetary concern, major Wall Street investors are also focusing on crowding people into small spaces and a life of permanent rentership. Britain’s Lloyds Bank and BlackRock have placed multi-billion-dollar bets on buying homes for the rental market. In the first quarter of 2021, investors accounted for roughly one out of every seven homes bought, a marked increase from previous years. A notion embraced by some financial groups as well as greens is one of a rentership society where people remain renters for life, enjoying their video games or attending to their houseplants, never knowing the pleasure of having a real garden or backyard of their own. It might assure a steady profit for the landlord class, but it would destroy the dream of ownership for the average person. The broader effect may resemble a modern form of feudalism, where both inherited wealth and institutional ownership, often the Church, concentrate control over housing. Need for Reform If unchecked, the pattern of declining ownership and rising prices for housing could shape the politics of the future, particularly among young people. Not surprisingly, many renters tend to favor leftist policies such as rent control and housing subsidies. The development of a class of permanent renters seems ideal for fomenting class warfare directed at an ever-shrinking number of owners, by a vast majority with no real assets, and little chance of getting any. Ultimately, the battle over land and property will define our future. We either accommodate hope among those in the next generation or force them to accept a lifetime of rental serfdom and permanent subservience to the state, or big capital, or both. As Conor Dougherty of The New York Times put it, “For all the focus on billionaires and stock prices, it’s home values that are a primary source of wealth inequality and the root of a generational schism between the housing-rich baby boomers and young adults today.” He quotes Edward Glaeser, a premier housing economist at Harvard, who said that the housing crisis has become “a huge hindrance on the quest for well-being and the pursuit of happiness.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

Title: These 5 Special Dividends Are More Than Meets The Eye

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Young businessman working on laptop at home. Most mainstream financial websites are not “smart enough” to include special dividends. The yields they display reflect plain ol’ quarterly or monthly payouts. For most stocks this does not matter. But for a select few “special payers” this is a costly oversight. One that we can capitalize on as thoughtful contrarians. In a moment we’ll discuss five special dividends. The vanilla screens say they pay as little as 3.2% but in reality they dish up to 13.8%! What exactly is a special dividend payment? It is a one-time cash payout, often the result of a massive cash influx from, say, selling off part of the company or having an unusually profitable year. Usually it is a one-shot deal. But it can be a regular thing. Let’s consider chicken producer Pilgrim’s Pride (PPC), which recently paid a $6.30 per share special dividend. This is a tremendous 12.7% yield. That’s amazing for people who held PPC at the time, but given the company’s dividend history, it’s likely this is it: PPC Dividend PPC is a classic example of a one-time payer. We are looking for exceptions—the one-time payment that happens every year! These are “regular” special dividends, sometimes called “supplemental dividends,” that the company pairs with a regular dividend they know they can afford. Example: ABC Inc. pays 25 cents per share quarterly, but at the end of the year, it pays out 50% of its free cash flow as a supplemental dividend. That dividend still might vary—say, $1 in 2023, $1.50 in 2024, and $1.25 in 2025—but it’s extra yield on top of what it can afford to pay on the regular. In some cases, these special dividend payers can be quite generous. Let’s take these 3.2%-11.3% yielders that actually pay out 9.0%-13.8% once we include their special distributions: Buckle (BKE)Stated Dividend Yield: 3.2%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 9.0% Buckle (BKE) is a mid- to high-end fashion retailer that’s primarily known for its jeans, but it also sells all sorts of apparel, activewear, swimwear and accessories. Fashion stocks have always been fickle, but post-COVID, they’ve been downright counterintuitive. Numerous “mall retail” stocks found themselves slowly declining in the years preceding the pandemic, only to find new life despite COVID broadly knocking brick-and-mortar retail on its tail. That includes the Buckle, whose top and bottom lines have dipped from their post-COVID highs but are still far better than what the store delivered for years prior to the pandemic. Looking at its regular dividend over the past decade or so, the difference is hard to notice—a couple of small raises in 2021, but that’s it. However, that’s because Buckle’s dividend has long been unlike its fashion retail brethren. The company prefers to pay a modest regular quarterly dividend, then top it up each year with sometimes spectacular special dividends that boost BKE’s yield by double, triple, sometimes even more. Naturally, the rub is that, by virtue of offering massive special dividends, the amount of income we collect from Buckle has the potential to shift enormously from one year to the next—even if the specials have been fairly consistent of late, and even if operational results are largely expected to remain steady over the next couple of years. Even the potential for income volatility isn’t great for retirement planners, but for more adventurous investors, it’s a secret store of upside that most people will typically overlook. Amerisafe (AMSF)Stated Dividend Yield: 3.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 9.7% Amerisafe (AMSF) is a relatively unusual insurer that deals in workers’ compensation. The company operates in 27 states and deals in “high-hazard” industries such as construction, trucking and agriculture. Anyone who wants to invest in an industry with consistent profits should sprint away from the insurance space. AMSF is actually relatively stable compared to, say, P&C insurance, where even good operators may occasionally suffer annual losses. But even then, Amerisafe’s bottom line is a moving target. Which makes a regular-and-specials program an extremely responsible way to manage the dividend. AMSF pays a modest (but growing!) quarterly dividend that typically yields around 3%. Then every year, usually in December, it will pay a special dividend with whatever profits it can spare. Like with Buckle, this payout usually doubles or triples the amount of income its shareholders collect in a given year. Again, retirees can’t plan their budgets around dividends like Amerisafe’s. But consider this: AMSF’s 2024 special dividend was the company’s lowest in roughly a decade, and it still boosted the stock’s total yield to nearly 10%. With that level of dividend, we don’t need much positive price action to have a great annual return. I’d keep an eye on that bottom line, though. AMSF’s profits, which have already slid for a couple years now, are projected to thin this year and next, too. One area of the market that’s rife with “regular” special dividends is the business development company (BDC) community. These companies share a lot in common with real estate investment trusts (REITs): they were both created by Congress, they both exist to allow regular investors to invest in an otherwise difficult-to-reach asset, and they both are required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends. But BDCs invest in dozens if not hundreds of small businesses: not exactly a hotbed of stability and reliability. So in the BDC space, we’ll frequently see fairly generous regular dividends complemented with specials that take already good yields and make them downright great. Gladstone Investment Corp. (GAIN)Stated Dividend Yield: 6.4%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 14.3% Gladstone Investment Corp. (GAIN) is part of my favorite Wall Street family: the Gladstones! This group of businesses also includes another publicly traded BDC, Gladstone Capital Corp. (GLAD), as well as a pair of publicly traded REITs: Gladstone Land Corp. (LAND) and Gladstone Commercial Corp. (GOOD). GAIN’s target portfolio company will generate $4 million to $15 million in annual EBITDA, have a proven business model, stable cash flows and minimal market or technology risk. As far as BDCs go, GAIN has a narrower portfolio than most, at just 25 companies—mostly manufacturing, business services and consumer services firms, but a few consumer product specialists, too. What sticks out most about Gladstone Investment Corp., however, is its willingness to deal in equity. Most BDCs will typically only have 5% to 10% exposure to equity, but GAIN’s target mix is 25% equity/75% debt. This is essential to GAIN’s “buyout” strategy. Gladstone Investment typically provides most (if not all) of the debt capital along with a majority of the equity capital. Its debt investments allow it to pay out a still-high regular dividend, but then it also pays out (extremely variable) supplemental payouts when they realize gains on equity investments. To wit, GAIN’s regular monthly dividend accounts for 6% worth of yield, but a 54-cent special dividend to be paid in June and a 70-cent distribution last October work out to an additional 8.3% in yield! That said, Gladstone’s specials are all over the place. The company paid three in 2022 and five in 2023, but just one in 2024 and (so far) just one in 2025. Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending Corp. (NCDL)Stated Dividend Yield: 11.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 13.8% Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending Corp. (NCDL) is among a handful of other BDCs, such as Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) and Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD), that’s connected from a big-name asset manager with a sterling reputation. In this case, NCDL is tied to both fund manager Nuveen, as well as its parent TIAA. The fund’s external manager—Churchill, a Nuveen affiliate—invests the BDC in senior secured loans to private equity-owned middle market companies in the U.S. The $2.1 billion portfolio is 210 companies strong right now. The vast majority of holdings (91%) are first lien loans, though Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending also deals in second lien debt, subordinated loans and equity co-investment. This is a relatively young BDC that has only been in existence since 2018, and it just went public in 2024. I wrote plenty about the company in a September column, but here, I want to focus on the payout. Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending has come out of the gate with a regular-and-specials format. The regular quarterly dividend has been set at 45 cents per share, and it has so far paid an additional 10-cent special in every quarter since its IPO. That’s a strong double-digit yield base with, at least for now, a meaningful 2.5 percentage points in special sweeteners. The special distributions were declared in connection with the IPO, and April’s 10-cent payout was the final dividend in that tranche. Indeed, NCDL’s streak might stop this summer—based on its previous activity, any special dividends to be paid in July likely would have been announced in April. If nothing else, investors should keep their eye on NCDL over the next few quarters to see whether these specials were a one-off event or something the BDC will come back to following strong financial results. Also, NCDL is young, so it’s difficult to tell where its “normal” valuation range will lie, but for now, the BDC is trading at an 11% discount to NAV. Barings BDC (BBDC)Stated Dividend Yield: 11.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 12.9% Barings BDC (BBDC) is the cheapest of these three BDCs, trading at an 18% discount to NAV right now. The Barings name might not mean much to some readers, but longtime BDC investors will surely remember the name “Triangle Capital.” That’s what the company was known as until August 2018, when the company rebranded following years of writing off bad investments and hacking away at its dividend. But it wasn’t just a rebrand—it was a new lease on life. Global financial services firm Barings became an external advisor and overhauled BBDC’s portfolio. Today, Barings primarily invests in senior secured private debt investments in “well-established” middle-market companies across numerous industries. Target companies for its sponsor-backed investments (issuers owned by private equity firms), the largest part of its business at 75%-85% exposure generally, generate between $15 million and $75 million in EBITDA annually. It also has smaller exposure to non-PE-owned businesses, as well as a pair of middle market first lien loan originators, Eclipse Business Capital and Rocade Capital. Meanwhile, about 70% of its investments are first lien loans, though it also has exposure to second lien, mezzanine, equity, structured, and joint venture investments. We’ve booked gains in BBDC twice through our Dividend Swing Trader service, so I frequently have my eye on this one for short- and long-term opportunities alike. So I was pleased to see when Barings made a splash in Q1. After a few years of dividend growth, the company’s quarterly dividend had been stuck at 26 cents per share since mid-2023. However, in February, Barings announced it would pay 5-cent special dividends across the first three quarters of 2025 “based on these strong results, our confidence in our portfolio, and the momentum we have seen so far in 2025.” While I’d prefer growth in the “stickier” regular dividend, this is a welcome development. The company hasn’t made “top-up” specials since 2014 and 2015. If BBDC makes this a lasting habit, its already stellar dividend will become even tastier. I’ll be keeping a close eye on the stock over the next couple of quarters to see if it extends this line of specials into the end of 2025 and into 2026.

Asset manager BlackRock has shown interest in acquiring a 10% stake in USDC stablecoin issuer Circle. The highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) will attract large crypto and traditional finance firms. This follows a thickening institutional plot in the crypto market, adding an extra layer of legitimacy for the high-flying assets. BlackRock is preparing to acquire part of Circle’s shares in its upcoming IPO, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Per a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Circle’s Chief Executive, Jeremy Allaire, plans to raise about $624 million in the IPO. The deal, which is expected on June 4, has recorded multiple orders for the shares available. The sources said the deal’s details are not finalized, and the $9 trillion asset manager could swoop in for a stake through another vehicle or opt out entirely. BlackRock and Circle are not strangers, as previous deals have already been struck. BlackRock manages a money market fund for Circle that backs the USDC stablecoin. The Fund now holds approximately $53.5 billion. USDC adoption is projected to build on gains in the past three quarters. Recent institutional developments in the United States, with its user base soaring, are tipped to favor the asset. Incoming stablecoin rules will also push its compliance in multiple jurisdictions. Circle initially filed for its IPO on April 1 but delayed due to rising economic concerns amid US tariff wars. The company has attracted big crypto firms like Ripple and Coinbase as users flock to its USDC stablecoin. Fortune reported informal sale talks with Coinbase and Ripple. However, Circle insisted it was not for sale following reports of a $4 billion bid deemed too low. According to the rebuttals, Circle remains committed to its long-term goals. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest is also preparing a $150 million swoop in Circle’s IPO. Digital asset traders remain thrilled as more institutional investors increase their exposure to the crypto market. According to experts, inflows have positioned assets for major upswings in Q2 2025. From investment in Bitcoin mining firms to stablecoin issuers, traditional players have raised the bar. Strategy, H100, and Addentax made recent Bitcoin acquisitions as the price closed at $110k. Meanwhile, GameStop announced a $513 million purchase, picking up 4,710 BTC.

(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) This latest US debt downgrade is a buying opportunity for us contrarians. I say that because we had the same (profitable) setup the last three times the ratings agencies took Uncle Sam’s credit rating down a peg. You might find that last sentence surprising. Three times? Indeed, the US government has seen its debt downgraded on three different occasions: 2011, 2023 and most recently a couple of weeks ago. You can be forgiven for not remembering all of these: In some cases (2023 comes to mind), they didn’t really make headlines. In others, they set up a small dip in stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds yielding 8%+) that was well worth buying. Let’s go through all three occasions and see what they can tell us. We’ll also look at how they affected the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in my CEF Insider service. ADX pays a roughly 9% dividend as I write this and sports a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of around 8%. The fund holds some of the biggest (and most credit-worthy!) US stocks, like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V), not to mention top-quality lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Let’s start in August 2011, when debt-ceiling wrangling in Congress prompted Standard & Poor’s to downgrade US government debt. At the time, this move was historic: No agency had ever downgraded the US government’s credit, which was considered incredibly safe. What happened next? US long-term Treasuries (in blue below) surged some 20% from the day of the downgrade through the end of 2011. The S&P 500 (in orange) also had a good run, returning nearly 6% over those few months. ADX (in purple) trailed behind, but as we’ll see next, this lag made it the best opportunity of the three. ADX 2011 Buying the S&P 500 was clearly a smart move here. But playing the contrarian and buying bonds after the downgrade delivered even faster returns. Over the long run, however, it was ADX (in purple below) that won out, with dividends reinvested: ADX Total Returns Now let’s look at the next downgrade, in August 2023. This time it was Fitch that cut Uncle Sam to the agency’s second-highest rating. ADX 2023 ADX (in purple above) has returned about 44% since then, as of this writing, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 30% gain (in orange). Meantime, Treasuries (in blue) are in the red. Why the difference in government-bond action between this downgrade and the first one? That’s another article on its own, but suffice it to say, it had more to do with slower-than-expected Fed rate cuts than the downgrade. The most recent downgrade, just a couple weeks ago, did cause a dip in stocks, ADX and bonds, however—though ADX has fallen the least as I write this. These declines are likely the result of tariff uncertainty, which has caused more anxiety than we saw in late 2023, when stocks were recovering from the 2022 pullback. ADX 2025 As you can see above, all three stayed flat until falling a little on May 20, then falling sharply the next day, when Walmart warned about price increases (and therefore lower consumer spending), and Target reported disappointing sales. The smart money did not sell when the news was first released on the 16th, but we are probably seeing more selling pressure as the retailers’ warnings have added anxiety. In the coming days, we could see stocks go flat or slightly negative if the sour attitude sticks around. But that would be a buying opportunity—especially for equity CEFs like ADX—similar to the openings we saw in 2023 and 2011. Another important point: the downgrade doesn’t impact all US assets. In its announcement, Moody’s makes clear that the downgrade impacts America’s “long-term issuer and senior unsecured” debt, but “the US long-term local- and foreign-currency country ceilings remain at Aaa.” In other words, the downgrade applies to US Treasuries greater than one year in duration (government bonds, basically, up to and including 30-year issues). Those bonds now have the second-highest rating from all three ratings agencies. At the same time, non-government debt issuers in the US can still have the top rating—including American companies. In fact, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) still have the Aaa rating from Moody’s. (Note that ADX holds Apple and Microsoft, so it’s a good pick if you’re still concerned about credit quality.) Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

ADX (in purple) trailed behind, but as we’ll see next, this lag made it the best opportunity of the three. ADX 2011 Buying the S&P 500 was clearly a smart move here. But playing the contrarian and buying bonds after the downgrade delivered even faster returns. Over the long run, however, it was ADX (in purple below) that won out, with dividends reinvested: ADX Total Returns Now let’s look at the next downgrade, in August 2023. This time it was Fitch that cut Uncle Sam to the agency’s second-highest rating. ADX 2023 ADX (in purple above) has returned about 44% since then, as of this writing, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 30% gain (in orange). Meantime, Treasuries (in blue) are in the red. Why the difference in government-bond action between this downgrade and the first one? That’s another article on its own, but suffice it to say, it had more to do with slower-than-expected Fed rate cuts than the downgrade. The most recent downgrade, just a couple weeks ago, did cause a dip in stocks, ADX and bonds, however—though ADX has fallen the least as I write this. These declines are likely the result of tariff uncertainty, which has caused more anxiety than we saw in late 2023, when stocks were recovering from the 2022 pullback. ADX 2025 As you can see above, all three stayed flat until falling a little on May 20, then falling sharply the next day, when Walmart warned about price increases (and therefore lower consumer spending), and Target reported disappointing sales. The smart money did not sell when the news was first released on the 16th, but we are probably seeing more selling pressure as the retailers’ warnings have added anxiety. In the coming days, we could see stocks go flat or slightly negative if the sour attitude sticks around. But that would be a buying opportunity—especially for equity CEFs like ADX—similar to the openings we saw in 2023 and 2011. Another important point: the downgrade doesn’t impact all US assets. In its announcement, Moody’s makes clear that the downgrade impacts America’s “long-term issuer and senior unsecured” debt, but “the US long-term local- and foreign-currency country ceilings remain at Aaa.” In other words, the downgrade applies to US Treasuries greater than one year in duration (government bonds, basically, up to and including 30-year issues). Those bonds now have the second-highest rating from all three ratings agencies. At the same time, non-government debt issuers in the US can still have the top rating—including American companies. In fact, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) still have the Aaa rating from Moody’s. (Note that ADX holds Apple and Microsoft, so it’s a good pick if you’re still concerned about credit quality.) Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Market Implications Of Tariff Litigation And AI Spending

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Despite what could be a lengthy legal battle, tariffs are unlikely to be removed completely. The ... More sectoral tariffs were not challenged and President Trump added additional steel tariffs on Friday. The tariff dispute does have some crucial implications for future trade deals and the tax bill. US economic data releases, which generally raised estimates of second-quarter economic growth, combined with strong earnings from Nvidia (NVDA), helped send stocks higher for the week. Additionally, improvement in consumer confidence helped raise optimism that the tariff overhang doesn’t need to sink the economy. A portion of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration was briefly overturned, though it was reinstated pending appeal. After the rally last week, the S&P 500 sits only 3.8% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 5.5% below its mid-December summit despite outperforming last week. Market Performance The betting odds of a recession in 2025 have continued to decline. This improvement aligns with the supportive economic data released last week, which increased the estimates of US second-quarter GDP growth. Furthermore, the Conference Board’s survey of consumer confidence rose after plummeting in the wake of President Trump’s tariff announcements on Liberation Day. Betting Odds Of US Recession In 2025 Notably, stocks hit their April low when betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, the S&P 500 index has risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Stocks & Recession Odds Nvidia did not disappoint investors with better-than-expected quarterly earnings and robust guidance for second-quarter revenue growth of 50% year-over-year. Some worries that the spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure had weighed on the mega-cap technology companies, as represented by the Magnificent 7. In early April, the group was 30% below their mid-December peak. Most of this decline has reversed due to lower odds of recession. Additionally, the first-quarter earnings season provided evidence of both continued spending on AI infrastructure and, more importantly, proof that companies were successfully monetizing these AI investments into tangible earnings growth. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Last week, the Court of International Trade (CIT) struck down the majority of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. The sectoral tariffs, for example, those on autos and steel, were not impacted by this ruling. The tariffs removed include the 10% universal tariff, the reciprocal tariffs, and the specific tariffs targeting China, Canada, and Mexico. According to Strategas, this would remove about $220 billion in tariffs, leaving just $40 billion of those implemented since the start of the year. Within less than 24 hours after the ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted a stay. Therefore, the tariffs will remain in place, and the US will not yet need to refund the tariff revenue collected to date. This litigation could be a lengthy process, but even if the tariffs are struck down at the end of the litigation, President Trump has the legal authority to reimpose tariffs via alternative methods. However, these methods come with some additional limitations. According to Strategas, Sections 338 and 122 of the Tariff Act of 1930 can be utilized quickly to reinstate many of the tariffs that are currently at risk. Section 338 allows for tariffs of up to 50% that take effect 30 days after announcement, with no time limit on their duration. Section 122 gives the president the authority to impose tariffs of up to 15% with immediate effect, but these tariffs can only remain in place for 150 days without congressional approval. Furthermore, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 permits the imposition of tariffs following an investigation by the United States Trade Representative (USTR). It is doubtful that tariffs will go away unless President Trump decides that they are, but the utilization of other methods is more laborious, time-consuming, and comes with more limitations. Even though tariffs seem likely to remain a part of the investment landscape, regardless of the outcome of the litigation, there are some crucial implications of the additional uncertainty. On the margin, the possibility that the courts could remove the tariffs leaves the Trump administration with less leverage to negotiate trade deals with other countries. Countries may choose to stall and see what happens with the litigation. The G-7 meeting in June could provide some insight into whether any new deals are forthcoming. The tax bill passed by the US House of Representatives was debt-neutral if the revenue from the tariffs was included in the scoring. The risk to the tariff revenue may further complicate the Senate’s deliberations in passing a version of the bill. Markets will remain on the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and the progress of the legal challenge. Further, retaliation from or trade deals with other countries will be notable. The economic calendar has the critical monthly jobs report on Friday. Expectations are for nonfarm payroll job growth to slow to 125,000 from 177,000 in April. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 4.2%. These forecasts are consistent with the weekly initial filings for unemployment benefits, which remain low and don’t indicate a collapse in the labor market. Initial Jobless Claims Ongoing claims for unemployment benefits are rising, indicating that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find new employment. The labor market is showing signs of bending but not yet breaking. Continuing Claims Regardless of the outcome of the tariff litigation, tariffs are unlikely to be banished completely. To that point, President Trump imposed a 50% steel tariff late last Friday, and these sectoral tariffs are not part of the current legal challenge. Recent hard economic data, along with some soft data, such as consumer confidence, have raised optimism that US economic growth remains resilient. Furthermore, technology spending related to artificial intelligence continues, with the sector producing robust earnings growth. This week’s jobs report will be another key indicator of the US economy’s health.

Title: Walmart, Amazon, Costco, And Home Depot Tackle The Tariff Whiplash

ByShelley E. Kohan ByShelley E. Kohan, Senior Contributor. Coscto is focused on member pricing and plans to try and mitigate as much of the impact from tariffs ... More as it can for its customers. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The five largest retailers in the U.S -- Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Kroger, and Home Depot-- have all reported their financial earnings for the first part of 2025. The combined force of these retailers equates to nearly 20% of total retail sales in the United States. The big five retailers all agree that it is difficult to predict the future impact of tariffs, however, each retailer has been working on mitigating the impact of tariffs on pricing and product availability for its consumers. The impact of tariffs on financial reporting so far this year has been minimal because most of the earnings reported are from periods before the April 5th tariffs took effect. Home Depot and Walmart shared financials through the end of April, while Costco data goes through mid-May. Kroger, which operates over 20 store banners including Ralphs and Harris Teeter, reported financials through January. Amazon’s first quarter financials run through March. Walmart, Amazon,Costco and Home Depot have pulled forward their inventory purchases to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Purchasing inventory in advance will help ensure a company has product in stock down the line and can offer the best possible pricing. Amazon encouraged its third-party suppliers to do the same. Costco moved up the delivery for patio products and sporting goods to stay ahead of the tariff pricing impacts. While Walmart says it cannot absorb all the cost pressures from tariffs and may have to raise ... More prices, it wants to keep food prices as low as they can. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Even the U.S.’s largest retailers cannot take the sole burden of the tariffs by absorbing the costs without raising prices. Discount stores, grocery stores, ecommerce players, and warehouse clubs typically run on very thin profit margins. "We’re positioned to manage the cost pressure from tariffs as well or better than anyone. But even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices," said Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart. The magnitude of the tariffs cannot be offset by lower-margin businesses. Home improvement giant Home Depot plans to maintain its competitive pricing despite tariff impacts through stronger supplier partnerships, supply chain diversification, and focusing on improving its productivity across activities. “We don’t see broad-based price increases for our customers at all going forward. It’s a great opportunity for us to take share, and it’s a great opportunity for our suppliers to take share as well,” said Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising at Home Depot. In the grocery sector, where food prices are 2.0% higher on a rolling 12-month basis, consumers are already having to spend more based on inflation. Companies like Walmart are trying to protect against additional costs due to tariffs on food products, considered a non-discretionary expense. “We won’t let tariff-related cost pressure on some general merchandise items put pressure on food prices, " said McMillon. Food tariffs on countries in South and Central America are pressuring imported items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and flowers. “We’ll do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible," said McMillon. Costco held pricing on pineapples and bananas despite the cost of these goods rising due to tariffs. However, when it came to flowers, which were also impacted by additional tariffs, the company felt that a price increase was absorbable by the consumer as flower purchases were viewed as a discretionary expense. Kroger, with 100% of its sales in the U.S., is looking at being proactive and diversifying its supplier base to keep prices lower, especially in the fresh produce category. "We expect inflation to be 1.5% to 2.5%, which does not include the effects from tariffs," said Todd Foley earlier in the year, interim CFO at Kroger. Amazon customers are becoming more reliant on the company for everyday essential products which ... More represented one out of every three units sold in the U.S. online at Amazon in the first quarter. Global retailers have been looking at diversifying sourcing options to reduce the cost of goods as tariffs are implemented. Amazon and Walmart have been diversifying their supply chains for many years, with a focus on not being too reliant on one country for imports. Two-thirds of what Walmart sells in the U.S. is made, assembled, or grown domestically. Walmart is further diversifying its revenue by leaning into better profit areas such as selling advertising through its retail media network, expanding its marketplace, and increasing membership income. Costco is rerouting goods to non-U.S. markets and working closely with suppliers to find alternate production locations. The private label brand, Kirkland Signature, which represents one-third of Costco’s sales, continues to be a consumer favorite in quality and value. The company has been sourcing the products into countries where items are sold to keep the pricing down. Costco’s most profitable sector, its membership revenue, is up 5.4%, with membership increasing to 137 million members last year despite a rise in its membership price. Home Depot has diversified its supply chain, with over 50% of purchases already sourced in the U.S. “We anticipate that twelve months from now, no single country outside of the United States will represent more than 10% of our purchases," said Ted Decker, CEO of Home Depot. Amazon is relentlessly focused on back-of-house infrastructure to improve delivery speeds and reduce costs by heavily investing in robotics and automation. The purchasing of everyday essentials continues to grow as a category for the consumer, making them more reliant on the Amazon brand and includes categories such as household goods, personal care items, and pantry staples. "We have an extremely large selection, hundreds of millions of unique SKUs (stock keeping units), which means we’re often able to weather challenging conditions better than others. When you have the broadest selection like we do and 2,000,000 plus global sellers like we do, you're better positioned to help customers find whatever items matter to them at lower price points than elsewhere," said Andy Jassy, CEO, Amazon. However, Costco’s narrow merchandise depth and broad assortment allow the company to focus on fewer SKUs, giving it a competitive advantage. "We believe our expertise in buying a limited SKU count model gives us greater agility to navigate the environment and ultimately increase our member values compared to the market," said Gary Millerchip, CFO at Costco. Home Depot will be looking at SKU optimization and possibly editing out some products that are significantly impacted by tariff costs but do not make sense to keep in its current assortment. Other retailers outside the big five have been working on optimizing the product styles that are most relevant to their customer base and eliminating the ones that are too costly or have lower turnover. As we move into the second quarter for most retailers (May through July), pricing may not be as impacted because retail buyers usually procure goods many months in advance of the selling season. However, going into fall and holiday selling, consumers may see price increases just in time for holiday purchasing. With imported items, the tariff is paid at the time it comes through customs, which means those products are most likely not in the U.S. yet. Retailers are unable to predict pricing for later in the year due to the uncertainty of where tariffs will land. There are too many assumptions and factors for retailers to chart a specific path forward during these highly unpredictable times in the retail landscape. The big five retailers continue to model various scenarios to help mitigate price increases or out-of-stocks for their customer base. The advantage with the larger multi-billion dollar retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Kroger, and Home Depot is the ability to leverage supplier networks and lean into the amount of resources available to help build out more sophisticated infrastructure to support a diversified supply network. The retailers are working hard to make sure prices stay in line with customer expectations, but it is too early within a volatile tariff landscape to predict the actual impact on pricing for consumers for the remainder of the year.

Title: Bitcoin Suddenly Braced For $7 Trillion ‘Critical’ Price Tipping Point After Stark BlackRock Warning

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 06/01 update below. This post was originally published on May 30 Bitcoin has fallen sharply since hitting an all-time high last week, down 6% despite the U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge bitcoin prediction. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, turbo-charged by Wall Street adoption led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and then U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of the technology (with Elon Musk quietly plotting what could be a bitcoin price game-changer). Now, as fears swirl the U.S. dollar could be teetering on the verge of collapse, a serious BlackRock warning that quantum computing could pose an existential risk to bitcoin has been escalated by a Google research paper that found encryption-breaking quantum computers could be a lot closer than previously thought. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has emerged as one of the most bullish voices supporting ... More bitcoin on Wall Street, helping the bitcoin price boom. “This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney wrote, referring to the number of quantum computer qubits needed to break a public-key encryption algorithm similar to that used by bitcoin. “If this is even remotely true, combined with everything else happening right now, the only safe trade are hard assets and, dare I say, gold,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya, a vocal supporter of bitcoin who claims to have first bought some when the bitcoin price was just $100, posted to X in response to the paper. 06/01 update: The bitcoin price has now plummeted by almost 10% from its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, falling to just over $103,000 and fast approaching the closely-watched $100,000 level. "Next week will be critical for both the crypto market," analysts with 10x Research led by Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note that suggested long-term bitcoin holders are beginning to sell. This coming week will see slew of economic and labor market data—topped by Friday’s monthly U.S. jobs report—as well as U.S. president Donald Trump’s controversial "big, beautiful" tax bill coming to the Senate and legal back-and-forth expected over Trump’s market-crashing barrage of global trade tariffs. Meanwhile, bullish bitcoin price analysts are predicting small changes in “sentiment” could trigger outsized market swings, with huge volumes of cash still sitting on the sidelines. “With roughly $7 trillion still parked in money market funds and another $2 trillion in fixed income ETFs, even a modest shift in risk sentiment could redirect meaningful capital into crypto and other high-beta assets,” Matt Mena, research strategist at crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) company 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “If bitcoin breaks out of the $105,000 to $110,000 range with conviction, we could see a sharp move to $120,000 and, more importantly, reach our previously year-end price target of $138,500 per bitcoin by the end of the summer.” Earlier this month, BlackRock quietly added a serious warning about quantum computing to the list of risks to its huge spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024. The fund now holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $70 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

More week before dropping back. “If quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock’s amended regulatory filing for its bitcoin fund read. The quantum computing risk to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, with tech giants including Google making strides in quantum computing research. “At this point, no blockchain is ready to withstand a quantum attack when this becomes possible, which could very well be much earlier than 2030,” David Carvalho, the chief executive of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure blockchain Naoris Protocol, said in earlier emailed comments that warned bitcoin is “sleepwalking into a disaster.”

It’s a new month, and investors are heading into it amid fresh inflation data and rising pessimism that’s dominating headlines. With the Fed’s next meeting now just weeks away, all eyes will be on Friday’s jobs report, which could shape expectations for rate cuts this summer. At the same time, President Trump’s legal battles continue to reverberate throughout the market, just as a whopping 83% of of CEOs say they’re bracing for a downturn. Add in jobs data and earnings from a host of consumer names like Lululemon (LULU), MongoDB (MDB), HP (HPQ), and Dollar Tree (DLTR), and the first week of June looks unlikely to be lacking in storylines. Here’s what to watch: Campbell’s Company – parent of popular shelf staples including Prego and Goldfish – will release earnings before the market opens, with a conference call scheduled for 8:00 a.m. ET. Analysts are expecting revenue of approximately $2.43 billion, reflecting 2% growth. On the macro side, at 10:00 a.m. ET, the U.S. Census Bureau will release the April 2025 Construction Spending report. This data provides insights into the health of the construction sector, which can influence economic growth projections and decision-making in closely related industries from real estate to manufacturing. Tuesday brings a greater mix of significant earnings reports and economic data releases that could sway market sentiment. Cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike (CRWD) will share Q1 2026 earnings after the market closes. Analysts are closely watching for updates following the company’s recent announcement to cut approximately 5% of its workforce in one more corporate bid for AI-flavored “operational efficiency.” HP and Dollar General (DG) also report. The discount retailer is mid-turnaround, with its stock price recovering around 30% this year but still well off 52-week highs. Looking to the hard-economics side, expect BLS data on job opening and labor turnover at 10:00 a.m., alongside the Census Bureau’s Factory Orders and the OECD’s globe-spanning Economic Outlook. Wednesday brings another dose of retail and tech earnings. Dollar Tree will report before the bell. With roughly 40% of its inventory sourced from China, investors will parse the results for tariffs’ effects on retail. After the close, MongoDB and Five Below (FIVE) release their results, too. MongoDB’s earnings will offer a read on enterprise software spending amid a 40% drop in the company’s stock price since last year. Five Below’s report should reveal whether tween-and-teen discretionary spending on pool noodles, inflatable chairs, and Disney-branded collectibles is still chugging along. Economic data hits early, with the ADP private payrolls report for May landing around 8:15 a.m. ET, an important preview of government jobs numbers due later in the week. At 9:45 a.m., the final read on S&P Global’s U.S. Services PMI offers a snapshot of activity in the economy’s biggest sector, followed at 10:00 by the Census Bureau’s manufacturing shipments and inventory data. Thursday’s earnings lineup features Lululemon and DocuSign, both reporting after the bell. Lululemon’s results will shed light on a very important athleisure-maxi-dress debate (subject of much TikTok controversy), as well as international growth and inventory levels. DocuSign, meanwhile, will be watched for clues on whether demand for e-signatures and contract management is holding up in a tight corporate spending environment. Analysts expect modest growth but remain wary of margin pressures and customer churn. The macro calendar launches at 8:30 a.m. ET with revised productivity and labor cost data for Q1, which gives context regarding wage-inflation trends. Also at 8:30, the Census Bureau’s international trade report for April provides a look at goods and services flows amid the trade wars. Both reports could sway expectations heading into Friday’s closely watched jobs release. Friday is a pivotal day for markets. No major earnings releases are scheduled, but the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the May Employment Situation report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Expect a comprehensive look at job growth, unemployment rates, and the overall health of the job market. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Famed market bear Albert Edwards tells BI stocks are vulnerable — and opens up about his role as Wall Street's 'uber-bear'

Even if the words coming out of Albert Edwards' mouth were gloomy, the famously bearish Société Générale strategist was in his usual good mood on Tuesday. It's something that tends to catch people off guard when they meet him, he said. "I'm quite a happy, upbeat person," Edwards told BI. "As opposed to the miserable bastard I come across in my written work." If you follow the British strategist's research, it's not hard to see why he comes across as a grouch. He is known as a perennial bear on Wall Street (he refuses the moniker of "perma-bear" and prefers "uber-bear"). His weekly client notes regularly question the prevailing market narrative and warn of downside scenarios. His latest report warned that rising Japanese bond yields could lead to a "global financial market Armageddon." His tune during a May 27 interview was no different. Edwards, who shot to fame for correctly calling the eventual dot-com bust in the late 1990s, said that stocks are still vulnerable to a pullback after their 18% rally from April lows. Despite investors starting to discount recession and inflation risks on the heels of President Donald Trump's tariff reductions, valuations remain high and risks abound, he said. One of those risks is the possibility that investors start to question hefty AI spending from the mega-cap tech firms. Another is a potential recession. But, in his opinion, the top risk the market should be aware of is rising Japanese interest rates, which could cause an exodus of capital from the US as investors unwind the yen carry trade and chase more attractive yields. The Bank of Japan, having kept interest rates low for years, pushed flows of money into US stocks and bonds. Now that the trend is reversing, those flows could grind to a halt, he said. Ultimately, however, it's not easy to know what will spark a stock-market decline. What's easier to know is simply that the market is in a precarious spot thanks to "steamy" valuations. One popular measure, the Shiller CAPE ratio, shows stock valuations at some of their highest levels in history. "These are really super high valuations," he said. "And you look at things like the relationship between bonds and equities, with bond yields where they are now and the equity risk premium being so low." "You just think, 'You're a bit vulnerable here to bad news, aren't you?'" he added. "Something comes along, you really are not in a great situation." Edwards is something of an anomaly on Wall Street. Most of the time, top strategists issue fairly bullish forecasts. For example, in January this year, the average 2025 S&P 500 price target saw 11.5% upside. Just two strategists — Stifel's Barry Bannister and BCA Research's Peter Berezin — predicted negative returns this year. It remains to be seen whether that will be the case, but suffice to say, investors were caught off guard by the S&P 500's 20% decline from February to April. It's these rapid declines, though few and far between, that Edwards wants investors to keep in mind as possible outcomes in frothy environments. As a result of pessimistic tendencies, Edwards isn't correct all too often, but that's not necessarily the point — and his readers know that. "A lot of clients who totally disagree with me like to read my stuff. It's a reality check," he said. Earlier this year, financial professionals detailed to BI the pressure that strategists face from both their bosses and clients if they're wrongly bearish for too long. David Rosenberg, who called the housing bubble and recession in the mid-to-late 2000s while working as the chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said the firm asked him not to use the word "bubble" to describe housing market dynamics at the time because it was scaring clients. Edwards said he doesn't feel that pressure. He writes his notes as Société Générale's "alternative view," separate from their house view. "You have to have good employers," he said. "People have said to me, 'If you worked at an American bank, you'd be fired immediately because of your views.'" Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Bitcoin’s $8B decline signals potential for a rebound, but macro challenges and bears remain in control. Macro headwinds are starting to weigh on the market. FUD is picking up, demand is clearly slowing, and bears are beginning to find their footing. Bitcoin [BTC] hasn’t established a reliable support base yet, and with long positions stacked up, the risk of a liquidation cascade is real. Still, the market feels like it’s on a knife’s edge. One decisive move from the bulls could flip the momentum fast. The next move likely defines the short-term trend. Let’s take a look at Bitcoin’s daily chart. You’ll see five straight red candles lighting up the board. On the 27th of May, BTC briefly touched $110K, then bears crashed the party hard, triggering a swift sell-off that squeezed the bulls tight. But the catch is, this liquidity surge followed Trump Media’s $2.5 billion Bitcoin treasury buy. Normally, that’d fuel a pump, but instead, traders hit the brakes, dialing up the risk-off mood. The culprit? Trade war jitters. As AMBCrypto pointed out, retail cash is fleeing back to safe havens like bonds, draining momentum from crypto. And it’s not just retail. Amid the U.S. equity slowdown, institutional capital is stepping back, too. BlackRock sold 4,100 BTC, snapping its 52-day streak of consecutive inflows. Source: Farside Investors Bears are flexing. In fact, Funding Rates on Bybit turned red for the first time in almost a month, adding to the downside pressure with the macro scene looking shaky. But here’s the thing: Bitcoin’s been dropping in a straight line – no crazy swings, no solid support yet, no bounce back. So what’s brewing? A full-blown distribution dump or just a tight liquidity squeeze ready to snap back? Putting macro noise and futures flows aside, a single sell-off won’t flip the script to distribution just yet. In fact, on the 29th of May, at $105,521, spot wallets saw an outflow of 8,175 BTC – signaling serious accumulation, not panic selling. On the derivatives front, as AMBCrypto flagged, on the 23rd of May, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) hit a record $80 billion, lining up with its all-time price high. What followed? A sharp round of deleveraging. At press time, Bitcoin’s OI slid to $71.86 billion. That’s a staggering $8 billion flush in just seven days. Source: CoinGlass That explains Bitcoin’s controlled, linear bleed. But without signs of capitulation from weak or strong hands, the bulls still have a window to strike back. So far, this looks less like panic and more like the board getting reset, ready for a healthier leg, once the macro clouds clear.

(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Gautam Adani-controlled Adani Energy Solutions Ltd. approved raising 43 billion rupees ($502 million) via a stake sale. The Adani Group unit’s board approved a proposal to raise the amount via “Qualified Institutional Placement” in one or more tranches, according to an exchange filing Saturday. Adani companies, with interests stretching from ports to green energy, are steadily regaining investor confidence after a US indictment of the founder soured sentiment. The group in April raised about $750 million for an acquisition, with BlackRock Inc. subscribing to about a third of the bond issue. Last week, its ports unit raised $150 million from DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in a bilateral loan. In March, Fitch Ratings removed Adani Energy from a rating watch and assigned it a negative outlook, citing moderating risks associated with the group’s liquidity. “The Adani group has demonstrated adequate funding access” since the US bribery charges, Fitch said in a statement.

Title: Letters: Michael McDowell is wrong about RTÉ being infiltrated by ‘Stalinists’ at the height of the IRA’s war against the Irish people

Senator Michael McDowell. Photo: Gerry Mooney Madam — In last week’s Sunday Independent (May 25) senator Michael McDowell took a sideswipe at those of us who worked in RTÉ current affairs at the height of the Provisional IRA’s war against the Irish people. In doing so he distorted the historical record and recycled the hairy old conspiracy theory that RTÉ had been “infiltrated” by The Workers Party activists who held the station’s current affairs coverage in a “vice-like grip”. I was one of the “Stalinists” senator McDowell was getting at in his interview with Dónal Lynch. For the record, I wasn’t “infiltrated” into RTÉ in 1978 but was offered the post of producer/director after a rigorous open public competition. I joined the current affairs programme Today Tonight in 1980 and was part of a large editorial team who robustly debated how to cover the biggest story of the day: the Provisional republican movement’s attempt to take power in Ireland, North and south, through “the ballot box and the Armalite”. Like the majority of my producer and researcher colleagues in RTÉ at the time I supported the ban on Provo and loyalist frontmen appearing on air to justify their terror campaigns. In backing Section 31, I and others like me in RTÉ, believed we were acting in defence of Irish democracy against an evil sectarian insurgency that sought to plunge the island of Ireland into a full scale ethnic civil war. In Dáil Éireann Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats all embraced this point of view. Workers Party TDs took the opposite view and voted in support of the arguments advanced by purist advocates of free speech and most RTÉ journalists. Their contention was that the apologists for murder would be held to account by tough forensic journalism. That never happened. In 1994 the ban on Sinn Féin appearing on RTÉ was lifted. At that time the Provos had no TDs sitting in Dáil Éireann. Thirty years later, despite being unrepentant about the war crimes of its military wing, Sinn Féin has 39 TDs, one more than Fine Gael. Like senator McDowell I regard the Provisional IRA campaign that Sinn Féin justifies as an “abomination”. That murderous Provisional “abomination” was at its most lethal in the 1970s and 80s. I am proud to state that I was one of many RTÉ programme makers who saw the slaughter perpetrated on behalf of “Irish freedom” by Provo “volunteers” for what it was, and called it out when it was most needed. Gerry Gregg, Blackrock, Co Dublin Madam — In years to come, a global generation of young people will confront their parents with two simple questions. What did you do to oppose the catastrophic genocide of innocent civilians in Gaza and what did you do to resist the deliberately induced famine? The very least we should be able to answer is that we demanded of our TDs an immediate implementation of the Occupied Territories Bill. A piece of legislation which in and of itself is a totally inadequate response to the incremental displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank and yet consecutive Irish governments have found multiple excuses to not apply even this deficient response. If we do not mobilise as a national collective to demand our representatives act on Israeli genocide, we, too, will have to bear the guilt of the morally outraged, yet at the same time otherwise engaged citizen. Kevin McCarthy, Killaloe, Co Clare Madam — I read the article last week, ‘Doctor sees nine of her 10 children killed in new IDF atrocity’, and wondered why it wasn’t on the front page. These awful atrocities by Israel continue and our national news is more interested in what new disrespectful, bully-boy tactics have been dreamed up by Trump, giving him priority. What has happened in the world where poor children can just be killed by a powerful and rich nation, cheered on by the USA (a country I used to respect), while the rest of the world seems afraid to show our total disgust. The bad will continue to wreak havoc uncontested if the good remain silent. I am proud that Ireland is vocal in its condemnation of Israel, but the media needs to give it more priority. Less prominent pages of newspapers can be reserved for Trump news. Siobhán Buckley, Mallow, Co Cork Madam — Letter writers last week wrote about the suffering of children in Gaza and accused Israel of genocide. No mention that the current war began when Hamas perpetrated the highest number of murders of Jews in one day since the Holocaust. If the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was genocide then the Allied campaign against Nazi Germany would have been genocide, too. Ciarán Masterson, Cathedral Road, Cavan Madam — John Boyne writes that he came out as gay to unequivocal family support. Many of us were not so lucky. He also says he was too afraid to attend Pride as a teenager. Many of us attend Pride, and campaign for our community, in spite of or even because of that fear. If all he can do at a time of rising anti-LGBTQ+ hate across the world is sit on the sidelines and throw barbs at a community he has never needed or aided, that might go some way to explain why our community doesn’t need or heed him now. Jess Connor, Glasnevin, Dublin 9 Madam — In his recent article, John Boyne argued for the repeal of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) 2015, referring to it as “problematic at best, and deeply misogynistic at worst”. Yet he offers no explanation as to what these problems might be. The issue of gender recognition has been thoroughly examined by the Irish courts and the Dáil since Dr Lydia Foy’s case began in 1997. To scrap this legislation would make Irish law incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr Boyne mentions “fear of being attacked” as a teenager. Yet repealing the GRA (the mechanism by which trans people can update documents to match their gender, presentation and appearance) would force trans people to out themselves constantly. We face the same hatred, from the same people, but Mr Boyne refuses to empathise with us. He would prefer to split our community based on our differences, rather than unite under our shared struggle. Ciara Witts, Birr, Co Offaly Madam — John Boyne’s column reads like a lengthy exercise in privilege, positioning himself as a spokesperson for a “respectable” gay minority. His account of coming out to unequivocal family support, a string of relationships, and public success is not just his personal experience — it’s a profoundly atypical one. His suggestion that Pride is no longer necessary because his life is comfortable reveals a breathtaking detachment from the daily realities still faced by many LGBTQ+ people. Pride was not built for those who never needed it. Boyne’s attempt to distance himself from LGBTQ+ culture does not make him brave or insightful. It makes him condescending. To imply that queer students are just “ruthlessly straight middle-class” dilettantes, or that trans women pose a threat to women’s rights, is scapegoating — fear dressed as reason. He praises the Cass Review as if it were universally respected, failing to acknowledge the flaws that have prompted criticism from within the medical and academic communities. What Boyne dismisses as hollow allyship — being told he is “loved, seen and heard” — is, in fact, empathy. His rejection of it says more about his own discomfort than the intentions of allies. Empathy, not elitism, is what underpins meaningful progress. Caz Koopman, Cobh, Co Cork Madam — I wish to compliment John Boyne on his brave, balanced, honest and insightful article about being gay. He sums it up very well when he says, “it is just the way I was born”. I agree. Dr Pat Mc Grath, Monkstown, Co Dublin Madam — It is wonderful to read John Boyne’s clear and refreshing refutation of our modern “Pride” celebration and the LGBTQ+ label. At a time when Pride flags are draped year round outside secondary schools and youth centres, we have to wonder what confusing ideology is being promoted to our youth in the guise of compassion and inclusion. The pendulum has swung too far and clear thinking and maturity is needed from the leaders of our community. Boyne is clearly showing leadership here and I hope our educators listen. Alan Coakey, Roscommon town Madam — As someone who has visited the United States many times, it saddens me that I will probably never go there again. Trump’s recent intention to have the social media accounts of visa applicants looked at is not only creepy, but scary. To me it is the last straw. This is going to cause widespread damage to the plans of students in Ireland who go to America every summer to work on a J1 visa. And after he is gone, his legacy will still linger as the much younger and even more right-wing JD Vance, the vice president who has publicly let it be known that he dislikes foreigners immensely, especially Europeans, will carry on Trump’s catastrophic policy of ripping America’s reputation to bits. Mike Burke, Sixmilebridge, Co Clare Madam — I want to congratulate Nikki Hayes for being so candid with Niamh Horan in last week’s Sunday Independent. I was stuck by the veracity of Nikki’s story and I want to take this opportunity to wish this brave woman every good wish for the future. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Madam — As an Irish pro-choice, pro-gay marriage feminist, I was delighted to read in the Sunday Independent that the commencement of the Government’s recently enacted surrogacy legislation has been paused and that a reconsideration is taking place. It is simply not the case that only conservative people oppose this legislation. There are very many liberal feminists in Ireland who oppose surrogacy because they want and work towards the best possible life for women and girls and this does not include having babies for anyone other than themselves. Anne Weadick, Galway city Madam — How timely was Niall MacMonagle’s interview with artist Michael Kane. Niall interviewed the artist before the opening of his exhibition in the Taylor Galleries. Michael died the day after. This particular interview captured the essence of the artist and this particular column is to be treasured because it captures the essence of the man. Niall is a superb interpreter of the art world and we could do with more words and more space from this columnist. Phyl Herbert, Rathmines, Dublin 6 Madam — Your restaurant critic’s review is my “go-to” page in Life magazine. It is always enjoyable. Last week, Lucinda asked: “Could this be the first 3-star?” This being Chapter One restaurant in Dublin and the 3-star being the elusive Michelin award. She supports her suggestion by telling us that, at the recent RAI awards, Chapter One, a Michelin 2-star restaurant, took the gong for the best restaurant in Dublin. I have no doubt that this is truly deserved. However, at the very same awards ceremony, Dede in Baltimore, also a Michelin 2-star restaurant, not only took the gong for the best restaurant in Ireland, but, as it happened, retained the gong won in 2024 for the best restaurant in Ireland. I would respectfully suggest that the Michelin Man should be more inclined, if and when they give the 3 stars, to look at the best in Ireland, rather than the best in Dublin — even if it is in West Cork, rather than in the capital. Michael Kenefick, Whitegate, Co Cork Madam — Gabija Gataveckaite and Mary Regan’s timely piece recently highlighted growing coalition unease over James Browne’s performance as Housing Minister. It’s hard not to ask: why didn’t Simon Harris, as FG leader, take the role himself? With housing in crisis, it would have been a clear signal of leadership. Instead, he chose Foreign Affairs and Defence. As Shane Ross noted recently, Ireland is acting like “a small country with a swollen head”. With record homelessness and housing starts at a four-year low, Harris’s decision speaks volumes. When the house is on fire, he is out installing satellite dishes. A housing tsar might yet be appointed, but we needed a political heavyweight months ago. Dylan Redmond, Leixlip, Co Kildare Madam — In response to a letter writer who pined for a more charismatic and youthful president of the United States, I wrote a letter to your newspaper with “Boring Joe Biden is doing just fine. He doesn’t have to leave his basement to get votes and instead concentrates on policy and enacting legislation”. Your predecessor edited those words to “Boring old Joe Biden” and gave me €50. Reading Shane Ross’s article last week, ‘Politics is a vocation where vanity captures its victims — I should know’, I’m reminded of that ageist sentence. Joe Biden was boring but by any standard he was one of the most successful bipartisan legislators of the past 50 years in US politics. What he was not good for though was selling newspapers or advertisements on cable TV. And therein lies the problem in the English-speaking western media. The 46th US president may still have lost to Donald Trump had he resisted the pile-on from the media and others to step down, but his record in government will stand the test of time. Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry Madam — If mass is the scientific term for the quantity of matter in a given object, and Mass is the ceremony that celebrates the sacrament of the eucharist, might it be a good idea to differentiate the two by using lowercase and uppercase? Mary Lally, Clontarf, Dublin 3 Madam — Having watched Uncharted on RTÉ, may I compliment the real heroes, the camera crew and the back-up team who took serious risks to get the daring footage. Well done also to Ray Goggins and the other amazing participants on their bravery.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five undervalued stocks represent quality companies trading at discounts to recent highs while ... More maintaining strong fundamentals and clear growth catalysts. The market's current volatility has created compelling opportunities for discerning investors willing to look beyond short-term noise. While headline indexes remain near historic highs, numerous quality companies are trading at significant discounts to their 52-week peaks, presenting attractive entry points for long-term wealth building. These dislocations often occur when broader market sentiment overshadows individual company fundamentals, creating the exact conditions where patient investors can capitalize. This analysis identifies five fundamentally strong companies currently trading at compelling valuations. Each selection represents a different sector, offering diversification benefits while maintaining focus on established businesses with durable competitive advantages, consistent cash generation and shareholder-friendly management teams that have weathered multiple economic cycles. The selection process prioritized companies trading at least 10% below their 52-week highs while maintaining strong underlying business fundamentals. Key evaluation criteria included consistent profitability, reasonable debt levels, competitive market positions, and management teams with proven track records of capital allocation and effective financial management. Special attention was given to dividend sustainability and growth potential, as these metrics often indicate management confidence in future cash flows. Additionally, each company needed to demonstrate resilience during recent market turbulence while showing clear catalysts for future growth. The focus remained on large-cap, established enterprises rather than speculative plays, ensuring each selection offers both value characteristics and quality business attributes that should appeal to conservative investors seeking both income and appreciation potential. ExxonMobil stands as America's largest publicly traded oil company, operating across the entire energy value chain, from exploration and production to refining and chemicals. The company has transformed its operational focus over recent years, prioritizing high-return, low-cost assets while maintaining one of the industry's strongest balance sheets. Recent strategic initiatives include expanding low-carbon solutions and optimizing its Permian Basin operations, which continue generating substantial free cash flow even at moderate oil prices. The company's integrated business model provides natural hedging between upstream and downstream operations, while its world-class refining network benefits from favorable crack spreads. Management has demonstrated disciplined capital allocation, returning significant cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases while maintaining the financial flexibility to invest in growth opportunities. Exxon's current valuation appears compelling given its strengthened operational efficiency and commitment to shareholder returns. The company trades at a meaningful discount despite generating robust cash flows and maintaining a fortress balance sheet with minimal debt concerns. Recent quarterly results demonstrated the effectiveness of the company's cost reduction initiatives, with strong margins achieved across all business segments. The energy transition presents both challenges and opportunities, but Exxon's low-carbon investments and carbon capture initiatives position it well for evolving market demands. The company's dividend yield of 3.86% appears sustainable based on current cash generation capabilities. In comparison, the stock's 18.7% discount from recent highs creates an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to the energy sector through a financially stable, dividend-paying leader. Fifth Third Bancorp operates as a diversified financial services company serving customers across the Midwest and Southeast through approximately 1,100 locations. The bank has established a reputation for prudent risk management and exceptional customer service, consistently maintaining strong credit quality metrics across various economic cycles. Recent strategic focus areas include digital transformation initiatives, commercial lending growth, and expansion of fee-based services, including wealth management and payment processing. The bank's geographic footprint covers economically diverse markets with steady population and business growth, providing a stable foundation for loan demand and deposit gathering. Management has consistently demonstrated disciplined expense management while investing in technology infrastructure to compete effectively with larger national banks and emerging fintech competitors. Fifth Third presents compelling value at current levels, trading at a significant discount despite maintaining solid operational metrics and capital strength. The bank's conservative approach to credit risk has positioned it well to withstand potential economic uncertainty, while rising interest rates are expected to benefit its net interest margins over time. Recent quarters have shown steady loan growth and improving efficiency ratios, indicating that management's operational execution remains strong. The 3.89% dividend yield appears well-covered by earnings, with management maintaining a conservative payout ratio that provides flexibility during challenging periods. Regional banks like Fifth Third often outperform during economic recovery phases, and the current 22.5% discount from recent highs creates an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to well-managed financial institutions with strong local market positions and proven management teams. Mondelez International operates as a leading global snacking company, owning iconic brands including Oreo, Cadbury, Toblerone, and Trident across the chocolate, biscuits, gum, and candy categories. The company maintains strong market positions in key geographic regions, with particular strength in emerging markets where rising disposable incomes drive consistent demand growth. Recent strategic initiatives focus on expanding premium product offerings and enhancing direct-to-consumer capabilities. The business benefits from recurring revenue characteristics as consumers regularly repurchase favorite snack brands, creating predictable cash flows that support consistent dividend payments and growth investments. Mondelez has demonstrated pricing power during inflationary periods while maintaining market share through effective brand management and innovation programs that resonate with evolving consumer preferences. Mondelez offers attractive defensive characteristics combined with growth potential in emerging markets where the company maintains leading positions. The stock's recent weakness appears overdone given the company's strong brand portfolio and consistent execution on margin improvement initiatives. Management has successfully navigated supply chain challenges while implementing strategic pricing actions that protect profitability. The consumer staples sector provides stability during uncertain economic periods, while Mondelez's global diversification reduces dependence on any single market. The 2.82% dividend yield, combined with the company's history of consistent dividend growth, appeals to income-focused investors. With shares trading 12.2% below recent highs despite posting positive year-to-date returns of 12.38%, the current valuation presents an opportunity to acquire a quality consumer products company at a reasonable price. General Dynamics operates as a premier aerospace and defense contractor, serving government and commercial customers through four main business segments: Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems, and Technologies. The company builds Gulfstream business jets, Virginia-class submarines, Abrams tanks, and various mission-critical technologies for defense applications. Recent contract wins and robust order backlogs provide revenue visibility extending several years into the future. The defense contractor benefits from stable, long-term government contracts while the Gulfstream division serves affluent individuals and corporations seeking premium business aviation solutions. This diversification provides balance between government and commercial revenue streams, while the company's reputation for engineering excellence and program execution has earned it preferred contractor status across multiple defense platforms. General Dynamics trades at an attractive valuation, despite holding a strong competitive position in defense markets that are experiencing increased spending globally. Recent geopolitical tensions have highlighted the importance of defense capabilities, while growing international demand for proven American military systems creates additional growth opportunities. The company's submarine construction programs alone provide decades of contracted revenue streams. The Gulfstream business continues recovering from pandemic-related weakness, with order activity showing improvement as corporate travel normalizes and wealthy individuals invest in private aviation. Management maintains a conservative approach to capital allocation while consistently returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The 2.18% dividend yield, combined with the stock's 13.2% discount from recent peaks, creates an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to both defense spending trends and luxury aviation recovery. Honeywell International operates as a diversified technology and manufacturing company serving aerospace, building technologies, performance materials, and safety solutions markets. The company's portfolio encompasses aircraft engines, automation systems, specialty chemicals, and safety equipment utilized across various industrial, commercial, and residential applications. Recent strategic focus emphasizes software-enabled solutions and sustainable technologies that address climate and energy transition challenges. The company benefits from multiple long-term secular trends, including aircraft fleet modernization, the adoption of building automation, and industrial digitization initiatives. Honeywell's engineering capabilities and established customer relationships provide competitive advantages in developing next-generation solutions for evolving market needs. In contrast, its diversified end markets reduce dependence on any single industry cycle. Honeywell represents quality industrial exposure at a reasonable valuation, with shares trading only 7.3% below recent highs despite delivering the strong year-over-year performance of 16.07%. The company's transformation toward higher-margin, software-enabled businesses has improved profitability metrics while reducing cyclical exposure. Recent aerospace recovery trends benefit multiple Honeywell divisions as air travel continues normalizing globally. The building technologies segment positions Honeywell to benefit from increased focus on energy efficiency and innovative building solutions. At the same time, performance materials serve the growing demand for specialty chemicals and advanced materials. Management's consistent execution of operational improvement initiatives, combined with disciplined capital allocation and a 2.01% dividend yield, makes Honeywell an attractive investment for investors seeking exposure to industrial innovation themes at a reasonable entry point. Bottom Line These five undervalued stocks represent quality companies trading at discounts to recent highs while maintaining strong fundamentals and clear growth catalysts. Each selection offers different sector exposure—energy, banking, consumer staples, defense, and diversified industrials—providing portfolio diversification benefits. The combination of attractive dividend yields, proven management teams, and compelling valuations creates opportunities for both income and capital appreciation as market sentiment eventually recognizes their underlying value propositions.

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. These five stocks represent diverse opportunities across technology, healthcare, and industrial ... More sectors, each positioned to benefit from powerful long-term trends. Market volatility and recent trade developments have created distinct opportunities across multiple sectors, from artificial intelligence powerhouses to healthcare giants navigating regulatory changes. Savvy investors are recognizing that current market dislocations often mask underlying business strength, particularly among companies with proven track records of innovation, market leadership and adaptability to changing economic conditions. This analysis identifies five compelling investment opportunities spanning technology, healthcare, industrials and data analytics sectors. Each selection represents companies well-positioned to benefit from long-term secular trends, trading at levels that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors with suitable time horizons and risk tolerance. The selection process emphasized companies demonstrating strong competitive moats, consistent revenue growth and clear catalysts for future expansion. Priority was given to market leaders within their respective industries, particularly those benefiting from transformative trends such as the adoption of artificial intelligence, healthcare innovation, industrial automation, and data-driven decision-making across enterprise markets. Each company needed to show resilient business models capable of generating sustainable cash flows while investing in growth initiatives. Special consideration was given to management teams with proven execution capabilities, strong balance sheets that provide strategic flexibility and business models positioned to benefit from ongoing technological and demographic shifts reshaping the global economy. Honeywell International stands as a premier diversified technology and manufacturing company, operating across aerospace, building technologies, performance materials and safety solutions. The company has successfully transformed itself into a software-enabled industrial leader, developing connected solutions that address critical challenges in automation, energy efficiency and digital transformation. Recent strategic initiatives focus on sustainable technologies, including renewable fuels, carbon capture solutions and next-generation automation systems. The company's diversified portfolio provides natural hedging against industry-specific downturns while positioning it to benefit from multiple long-term growth drivers. Honeywell's aerospace division serves both commercial and defense markets. At the same time, its building technologies segment capitalizes on increasing demand for innovative building solutions and energy management systems that reduce operational costs and environmental impact. Honeywell represents exceptional value in the industrial technology space, combining steady dividend income with significant growth potential from emerging technologies. The company's transformation toward higher-margin software and services has improved profitability metrics while reducing cyclical exposure. Operating margins have expanded to over 20%, with return on invested capital consistently above 15%, reflecting disciplined capital allocation and strong pricing power. Recent aerospace recovery trends benefit multiple business segments as commercial aviation continues normalizing and defense spending remains robust globally. Honeywell’s Aerospace division contributed nearly 40% of total revenue in the last fiscal year and is expected to grow further as backlogs normalize and global air travel rebounds. The Building Technologies division positions Honeywell perfectly for the ongoing shift toward smart infrastructure and energy-efficient solutions, particularly as regulatory requirements drive the adoption of automated building management systems. This segment also supports a recurring revenue model through service contracts and software subscriptions, contributing to earnings stability. Management's consistent operational execution, combined with strategic investments in breakthrough technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and quantum computing applications, creates multiple pathways for long-term value creation while maintaining attractive current income through reliable dividend payments. With a payout ratio under 50% and consistent dividend increases, Honeywell remains a compelling choice for income-focused investors seeking exposure to industrial innovation. NVIDIA Corporation has emerged as the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence computing, providing the essential hardware and software infrastructure powering the global AI revolution. The company's graphics processing units form the foundation for machine learning, data center acceleration, autonomous vehicle development and scientific computing applications across virtually every industry. Recent strategic partnerships, including collaborations with major technology companies and governments, demonstrate the critical nature of NVIDIA's technology in next-generation computing applications. The company's comprehensive AI platform extends beyond hardware to encompass software frameworks, development tools and cloud services, fostering long-term customer relationships and generating recurring revenue streams. NVIDIA's data center business has become the primary driver of growth. At the same time, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive segments provide diversification and additional expansion opportunities as AI capabilities are integrated across more applications. NVIDIA occupies a virtually unassailable position in one of the most transformative technology trends of this generation, with artificial intelligence adoption still in its early stages across most industries. Recent partnerships, including collaborations with Saudi Arabia on AI initiatives, demonstrate the global strategic importance of NVIDIA's technology and provide new revenue opportunities in emerging markets seeking to build AI capabilities. The company's technological moat continues widening as competitors struggle to match NVIDIA's integrated hardware-software approach and extensive developer ecosystem. Gross margins remain strong, above 70%, reflecting the company's ability to command premium pricing in a high-demand market. While the stock trades at premium valuations, the massive addressable market for AI computing, combined with NVIDIA's dominant market share and accelerating adoption rates across enterprise and government sectors, justifies higher multiples. The company's ability to maintain pricing power while scaling production positions it for sustained revenue and margin expansion as AI infrastructure investments accelerate globally. UnitedHealth Group operates as America's largest healthcare company, serving over 50 million members through its UnitedHealthcare insurance business while providing comprehensive health services through its rapidly growing Optum division. The company has built an integrated healthcare ecosystem that combines insurance, pharmacy benefits, medical care delivery and health technology solutions, improving patient outcomes while reducing overall system costs. Despite recent stock volatility related to regulatory concerns, UnitedHealth's fundamental business model remains strong, benefiting from aging demographics, increasing healthcare utilization and the ongoing shift toward value-based care arrangements. The Optum division has become a significant growth driver, providing technology-enabled services that help healthcare providers improve efficiency and patient care quality. UnitedHealth's current valuation appears compelling given its dominant market position and multiple growth drivers across both insurance and services businesses. The recent regulatory-driven volatility, exacerbated by a high-profile fraud lawsuit, has led to a steep selloff, pushing the stock down significantly and compressing its valuation to a forward P/E of just 12. For a company with UnitedHealth’s scale, diversified revenue streams and consistent double-digit earnings growth over the past decade, this represents a rare opportunity to buy a high-quality business at a deep discount. The company's integrated model provides competitive advantages that are difficult to replicate. Healthcare spending continues growing faster than GDP, driven by demographic trends and medical innovation, creating a favorable operating environment. The company's investment in technology and data analytics capabilities positions it well for the ongoing transformation toward personalized medicine and value-based care delivery models. Optum's expansion into new markets and services provides significant revenue diversification beyond traditional insurance operations, while the company's strong balance sheet enables continued strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. The combination of defensive healthcare exposure and growth potential makes UnitedHealth attractive despite near-term legal and regulatory headwinds. Johnson & Johnson stands as one of the world's most diversified healthcare companies, combining leading pharmaceutical research with innovative medical devices and trusted consumer health products. The company's pharmaceutical division develops breakthrough treatments for cancer, immunology, infectious diseases, and neurological conditions, while its medical device business serves the global surgical, orthopedic, and vision care markets. The company has demonstrated remarkable consistency over decades, generating steady cash flows that support continuous research investment and regular dividend increases spanning over 60 years. Recent strategic initiatives include expanding oncology and immunology portfolios through both internal development and strategic acquisitions, while divesting non-core consumer brands to focus on higher-growth healthcare segments with stronger competitive positioning. Johnson & Johnson offers exceptional stability combined with growth potential from its industry-leading pharmaceutical pipeline and medical device innovations. The company's diversified revenue streams provide resilience during economic uncertainty. At the same time, its strong research capabilities and established regulatory relationships enable the successful development of breakthrough treatments that command premium pricing and market share. The pharmaceutical division's focus on high-value therapeutic areas, such as oncology and immunology, aligns with some of healthcare's fastest-growing segments—meanwhile, the medical device business benefits from aging demographics and increasing demand for minimally invasive surgical procedures. Management's disciplined capital allocation, combined with the company's AAA credit rating and commitment to dividend growth, makes Johnson & Johnson particularly attractive for conservative investors seeking reliable income growth, capital preservation and upside potential from medical innovation. Palantir Technologies specializes in big data analytics platforms that enable organizations to integrate, analyze and act upon massive datasets for critical decision-making. The company serves both government and commercial clients through its Gotham platform for defense and intelligence applications and Foundry platform for enterprise customers across industries, including healthcare, energy, manufacturing and financial services. The company's software enables customers to uncover hidden patterns in complex data, optimize operations and make data-driven decisions that were previously impossible due to technological limitations. Recent commercial expansion has accelerated as enterprises recognize the competitive advantages provided by advanced analytics capabilities. At the same time, government contracts continue providing a stable revenue foundation and development funding for cutting-edge capabilities. Palantir operates at the intersection of several powerful trends, including the adoption of artificial intelligence, digital transformation and data-driven decision-making across both government and enterprise markets. The stock's strong 2025 performance reflects growing recognition of the company's unique capabilities and expanding market opportunities as organizations prioritize analytics investments to maintain competitive advantages. The company's government relationships provide both revenue stability and access to cutting-edge use cases that drive product development, while commercial market expansion offers significant scalability potential. Palantir's software platforms create high switching costs once implemented, leading to strong customer retention and expanding usage over time. The increasing importance of data analytics across all industries, combined with Palantir's proven ability to handle complex, mission-critical applications, positions the company for sustained growth as digital transformation accelerates across both public and private sectors. Bottom Line These five stocks represent diverse opportunities across technology, healthcare, and industrial sectors, each positioned to benefit from powerful long-term trends. From NVIDIA's AI dominance to Johnson & Johnson's healthcare stability, UnitedHealth's integrated model and ultra cheap valuation due to regulatory risks, Honeywell's industrial innovation, and Palantir's data analytics leadership, investors gain exposure to multiple growth drivers while balancing risk across different market segments and business models.

Title: Streetwear Marketing: Definition, Strategies + Examples (2025) - Shopify Australia
URL: https://www.shopify.com/au/enterprise/blog/how-retailers-use-streetwear-brands-to-reach-todays-consumers
Time Published: 2025-05-31T20:18:33Z
Full Content:
Consumer brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma see major growth opportunities in the newfound elevation of streetwear. All of a sudden, they’re more than just sports apparel brands—they’re nods to high fashion, open doors to what’s cool. These brands also know “sneakerheads”—people who are addicted to the chase for an exclusive item—will wait hours in front of a store for a limited-edition product. The coinciding rise of athleisure (a hybrid of gymwear and leisure clothing), and the celebrity influence on that stream of fashion, has further encouraged these consumer brands to lean into the fashion-meets-casual streetwear look. It’s contributing to a streetwear industry valued in excess of $347 billion. Streetwear is a type of casual clothing heavily influenced by popular culture. It’s an eclectic mix of apparel from New York’s hip-hop culture and California skateboarding fashion that became popular in the 1990s. Today, streetwear dominates the social media scene. This has contributed to a global streetwear industry that accounts for about 10% of the global footwear and fashion industry. Growth in the streetwear market shows no signs of slowing down. Experts predict the industry will hit a $637 billion valuation by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.89%. Why? Because customers spend big bucks on streetwear: Sneakers are the standout streetwear product, with 62% of consumers selecting footwear as the item they were most likely to buy. Other popular streetwear pieces include oversized t-shirts, hoodies, and joggers. Unlike traditional luxury retail, buying streetwear involves cultural knowledge as much as disposable income. The Streetwear Impact Report notes 70% of streetwear customers value brands’ commitment to social issues, with 59% prioritizing brand activism. Moreover, 47% indicated they would likely stop purchasing from brands with representatives who behave inappropriately. Streetwear buyers tend to be millennial or Gen Z, and have some disposable income. They’re typically working professionals who don’t have children or mortgages to worry about, and have lived most of their lives online. A report by Hypebeast confirms this: Kristen Classi-Zummo, apparel industry analyst at NPD, told Vogue Business that “Gen Z wants a bike short that they can wear to both the airport or to brunch, but they are also looking for it to keep them cool and stay in place.” Thanks to the democratization of social media, everyone will know that a cool t-shirt is expensive or a pair of headphones costs $3,000. The rise of the tech sector and fewer traditional industries employing young people has also meant smart, expressive and casual clothing is now more accepted in the workplace. Social commerce platforms like TikTok and Instagram dominate the marketing strategies of many streetwear brands for this reason. The typical user of both platforms is a Gen Z consumer who’s grown up in a hyperconnected digital world where likes are a normalized currency. Streetwear shoppers show diverse shopping habits but strongly prefer direct channels. According to Hypebeast, 53% of consumers prefer buying from physical brand stores, while 42% favor brands' own ecommerce sites. This highlights Gen Z and millennials' desire for exclusive, direct interactions rather than shopping via multi-brand retailers or social media. When you work for a streetwear company, it’s easy to get caught up in the nitty gritty details of your product. After all, you’re proud of each item, and they tend to sell out. But streetwear customers don’t always buy individual items because of their impressive specifications. People buy them to fit into streetwear culture—a lifestyle movement where dressed-down, comfortable clothing is a social status. Maniere De Voir is one streetwear brand which took this approach with a marketing campaign. Slotted between Instagram posts that showcase their products, they publish short-form videos that sell the lifestyle their target audience is looking to create. This Instagram Reel, for example, showcases interior design that’s cozy and minimalist—two adjectives that customers would use to describe the brand's image. Incorporate this into your streetwear brand marketing strategy by creating a broader identity around your clothing brand. What words would customers use to describe your streetwear items? What does their dream life look like? Angle your marketing campaigns around the answers to sell the lifestyle they want to create using your apparel. The roots of streetwear’s community culture go back to niche online forums like NikeTalk, BapeTalk, and Strictly Supreme. Although these early forums have declined, the community ethos persists on platforms like Instagram, driving brand loyalty through shared cultural connections and peer-to-peer inspiration. Tap into these communities when you’re: Streetwear brand Charlie Hustle is one retailer using the local community approach to drive consumer loyalty. Their slogan is “do good, feel good, look good”—a motto the brand helps their audience achieve through their Communi-TEES program. Consumers in the Kansas City area can donate to local charities through any purchase they make on the brand’s direct-to-consumer store. The digital-native Gen Z relies heavily on social media influence when determining which products to buy. For the majority of streetwear customers, social media is the top source of inspiration. It beats the street, word of mouth, and fashion publications. This makes sense—Gen Z’s purchasing habits are wildly different from older generations. Data compiled in the Shopper Preference Report for 2025 found that almost 80% of Gen Z and millennials use social media to make purchases. But a simple social media marketing strategy isn’t enough. Although Hypebeast found most consumers use social media as a source of information, just 31% consider a brand’s own social media presence an important factor. Plus, with platforms like TikTok enabling everyone to be a creator, fashion brands can tap into the social nature of streetwear while publishing the user-generated content their audiences trust. Shopify Collabs helps brands discover creators, influencers, and affiliates in the streetwear industry. Partner with these creators—be that through gifted products, sponsored posts, or affiliate commissions—to generate UGC through influencer marketing. This will show how your streetwear items look on real people. Streetwear brands are leaning into co-marketing opportunities as a way to stand out in a saturated market. Shopify’s Alex Danco says that "the biggest opportunity flying under the radar is collaboration. It’s the best way to increase the number of buyers who know and care about you in a way that turns you into not competitors but cooperators, perhaps even allies and friends.” Identify brands that share your audience. The best collaborations are between two brands that share overlapping brand values and customer demographics without being direct competitors. Alex adds: “Collaboration is truly the win-win way for brands to find new audiences in a way that doesn’t dilute your brands.” Sportswear-turned-streetwear label Puma takes this to the extreme with their Dua Lipa partnership. The singer, known for her casual fashion sense, launched a limited edition collection with the brand. Both parties went back and forth on Instagram to strengthen the partnership and get both customer bases excited. The sneakers element is a particularly interesting collaboration. Hypebeast reports that sneakers are the most popular streetwear product, but that this market is also one of the most saturated. As Zofia Zwieglinska, international fashion reporter at Glossy, says, “Most brands dedicate a portion of their collection to streetwear, and sneakers in particular. Tie-ins to art and music have continued—from the Nike x RTFKT partnership with Takashi Murakami to Tiffany's tie-in with Basquiat and Beyonce. “However, sneakers and streetwear have reached a saturation point—the differentiators now will be with brands that can evolve it to suit a new type of customer.” Gen Z uses social media to research brands more often than search engines, and social media is driving in-store foot traffic (and subsequent sales) for many streetwear retailers. More than half of customers say they’re most likely to buy streetwear items through a physical brand store, followed by 42% who head to the retailer’s ecommerce website—which is why 60% of retailers say flagship locations are a key part of their brand strategy. British streetwear brand Corteiz has mastered this online-to-offline marketing strategy. Their social media presence drives in-person commerce with time-sensitive product drops at key locations in London. This Instagram post, for example, encouraged followers to visit the brand’s market stall with 99p in exact change to buy their blackout cargo trousers. The stall was only open for two hours, and coordinates for the location dropped just a few hours before the event began. The viral nature of Corteiz’s in-person product drops helps build a base of die-hard fans who want in on the brand’s community. So much so, people document their attempts to locate Corteiz’s product drop locations on YouTube and TikTok—a streetwear brand marketing idea that gets customers to do the legwork of building hype around product drops. Experiment with new markets and products quickly—without the overhead. Make sales wherever your customers are with Shopify POS and mobile card readers, so you can accept payments on the spot. Learn more With customers craving experiences from the streetwear brands they interact with, the metaverse—a 3D virtual experience where customers can play, shop, and interact with other people—is quickly becoming a staple in many marketing strategies. German sneaker retailer Flowers For Society is one label centered heavily around metaverse experiences. Their first product drop, which was only available through preorder, linked every item with a unique non-fungible token (NFT). Customers gained access to the brand’s own metaverse community, unlocking exclusive access to future product drops, limited edition apparel, and exclusive collaborations. Sell NFTs on your streetwear store with Shopify. Give customers exclusive access to products, collections, and discounts, and sync your store with community engagement channels like Discord—all in one place. Exclusivity is an important element for streetwear fans. Zofia from Glossy says, “Digital-native brands need to focus on how streetwear customers interpret value differently to their other customers. Aspects like rarity, collectability, and wider cultural value matter more to these customers, as well as engagement with the brand community.” Two-thirds of streetwear brands surveyed by Hypebeast described the drop model as important to their business. It capitalizes on rarity, collectability, and cultural value by making streetwear products time- or quantity-limited. Streetwear brand Live Fast Die Young uses the drops model to fuel their social media campaigns. On Instagram, the retailer regularly teases new product drops, such as their new 54-piece collection. Customers flock to the comment section to express their anticipation. Maksim Telkov, ecommerce manager at Live Fast Die Young, adds: “With our product drop strategy, we always had problems with over ordering or that payments didn't go through. With Shopify, these issues were resolved all at once.” Use Shopify’s preordering functionality to create product pages and capture leads before the product goes on sale. You’ll be able to take full, partial, or no payment from customers and set expectations on when the item will be delivered. If they don’t buy this time, an automated email marketing series can convert subscribers into paying customers. Email your subscribers when the product drops—a surefire way to get their attention, rather than relying on a social media post which might get buried in a crowded feed. Sustainability is more than a buzzword for modern consumers—McKinsey reports that two in three customers think sustainability is an important factor when buying apparel. Customers have the same approach to sustainability when purchasing streetwear. The majority of consumers said social issues were important to them, with brand activism playing a role in the clothing brands consumers choose to connect with. Coney Island Picnic cofounder and creative director Ryan Wood says the brand prioritized sustainability in their mission to keep up with consumer preferences: “About a year ago, our brand made the conscious decision to shift the manufacturing of all tees and fleece to be sourced from organic cotton without raising the price for customers.” This commitment to sustainability is deeply rooted across every aspect of the brand’s marketing strategy. Coney Island Picnic displays a “sustainable” category in their ecommerce navigation, produces short-form TikTok videos to explain their brand mission, and highlights how products are made using organic cotton within product descriptions. Ryan says: “As we know, the fast fashion industry's current trajectory will not sustain much longer, and many consumers want to avoid being a part of the wasteful cycle. Therefore, more consumers are taking note of sustainable retailers they can trust and becoming repeat customers.” If you’re not in a position to make your products more sustainable, don’t try to pull the wool over your customers’ eyes. Greenwashing—the term people use to describe clothing brands that exaggerate their role in making their business more sustainable—doesn’t fly with Gen Z customers. You can make small changes to prove your streetwear brand is moving in the right direction without overhauling your entire logistics strategy or supply chain. The Shopify Planet app, for example, makes a small contribution to the Shopify Sustainability Fund. This fund is used to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and make shipping carbon-neutral. Gen Z has had to thrive in difficult economic conditions. They report higher rates of anxiety, depression, and distress than any other demographic, often turning to nostalgia as a temporary escape from normal life. Business Insider reports the nostalgia trend is being driven by this generation. In the article, Krystine Batcho, professor and psychologist at Le Moyne College, says, “For many people, particularly young adults or those without a financial safety net, poor economic conditions raise fears of being able to meet financial obligations like rent or student-debt payments.” Related hashtags like #nostalgia and #Y2K are both thriving on TikTok, having each amassed billions of views. Streetwear brands are tapping into this nostalgia to connect with Gen Z consumers. Mauv Studio, for example, launched an entire brand that reflected the Y2K aesthetic. Experiential drops amplify streetwear’s exclusivity. Supreme and luxury brands like Dior and Burberry have adopted the drops model, limiting product availability to enhance desirability. Hypebeast notes that 66% of streetwear industry respondents view the drops model as core to their strategy. Corteiz created significant buzz with their DA GREAT DENIM EXCHANGE popup event in Brooklyn. Founder Clint Ogbenna, known simply as "Clint," announced the event just 24 hours in advance on Instagram. Folks came down to exchange jeans from popular brands (Levi’s, True Religion, Carhartt, etc.) right off their bodies for a free pair of Corteiz denim. The tactic was covered by outlets like GQ and earned hundreds of thousands of views on social media, a massive win for Corteiz. Clint himself appeared at the event, personally interacting with attendees and handing out individually numbered dollar bills as tickets. The traded-in jeans were later donated to youth charities, adding a social-impact dimension. New York-based brand Supreme is highly regarded for its influence on streetwear culture. What started as a Manhattan skateboarding store turned into a business acquired for $2.1 billion by VF, the parent company of VANS. Every new product is associated with a time-sensitive drop only available at one of their 11 retail stores. But you need an invite to get there, and a one-purchase per person limit applies. Only customers on Supreme’s mailing list get the “golden ticket”—an invitation to join the hundreds of people that queue around the block to get their hands on a Supreme drop. And if they want more than one piece, they’ll need to bring a friend. The founder of iconic streetwear brand A Bathing Ape (BAPE), Japanese artist Nigo, intentionally made a limited amount of merchandise when he started out in the early 1990s because he knew the desire for exclusivity would help his brand grow. HighSnobiety reports that “Nigo started out on a tight budget and could only afford to produce around 50 T-shirts a week—but he also disliked the idea of everyone wearing the same thing.” Alongside their drop model, BAPE got celebrities to wear their products to build hype and create the social symbol many streetwear customers aspire to. Hip-hop stars like The Notorious B.I.G and Pharrell sported BAPE products, with Soulja Boy even rapping the words “I got me some Bathing Ape” in his 3x Platinum hitCrank That. Australian streetwear retailer Culture Kings is known for its shopping experience. Instead of allowing shoppers to passively browse items, their stores are a true community experience. The non-shopping activities on offer include: Culture Kings turned to Shopify with a goal to mimic these in-store experiences for global shoppers online. They customized their storefront to display tailored, dynamic product listings with a “Shop the Look” page. Anyone viewing the brand’s social media content could easily shop the latest products through this landing page. Simon Beard, cofounder of Culture Kings, said: “Shopify—what it really did is allow us to more focus on our art side rather than being so bogged down in the science side, which was not our forte. It really enabled us to scale, knowing that we had this platform that delivered, that can grow with us.” Off-White differentiates itself from other streetwear players by bridging the gap between luxury brands and pop culture. Their founder and former artistic director of Louis Vuitton, the late Virgil Abloh, started the company in 2012 under the original name Pyrex Vision. According to Front Office Sports, Off-White came to life as a result of Abloh’s 3% approach—the idea that a new design could be created with just a 3% difference. Part of this differentiation includes irony—a sense of humor Gen Z consumers can bond over. Many of Off-White’s streetwear products obviously state the use case in quotation marks, like this windbreaker coat with the word “water” splashed across the back. Princess Polly, an established streetwear company located in Australia, took a unique approach with their marketing strategy. Alongside becoming a staple in their Gen Z customers’ shopping routine, the streetwear brand wanted to deliver a seamless experience long after the first purchase. Alexandria Collis, director of operations at Princess Polly, says, "We're always looking for ways to create less pressure points for customers. Making returns difficult shouldn't be the goal—there's actually a real opportunity to create loyalty through the return experience." The first stage was Princess Polly’s migration from Magento to Shopify. They then enlisted the help of Shopify Technology Partner Loop to access measurable returns insights and allow customers to exchange items, rather than request a refund. The result? Princess Polly saw a 55% reduction in out-of-stock rates with their new instant exchange function. Alexandria Collis adds: "Thanks to Shopify and Loop, we’ve seen a huge improvement in our return experience, with customers telling us firsthand that they appreciate how easy it is. And not only is it improving our customer loyalty—it's also driving a significant uptick in revenue." Kyle Ng, founder of the streetwear brand Brain Dead, is redefining streetwear culture through a maximalist, community-focused approach. Kyle is building an expansive lifestyle around eclectic interests, hosting hardcore music festivals, running a movie theater (Brain Dead Studios), organizing Magic: The Gathering tournaments, and collaborating creatively with figures like Jeff Goldblum, Seth Rogen, and Freddie Gibbs. Brain Dead has also branched out, notably reviving avant-garde Oakley shoe designs from the 1990s. Kyle actively avoids mainstream, predictable brand collaborations, instead choosing projects driven by genuine personal interests and niche subcultures, like vegan burgers or indigenous artisan-made Minion products featuring the familiar characters from the Despicable Me franchise. In September 2021, luxury fashion brand Balenciaga took fashion marketing to a new level by partnering with Fortnite, one of the most popular video games globally with over one million players at any given moment. Balenciaga designed digital outfits, known as “skins,” that players could buy within the Fortnite in-game store. The skins were inspired by real-life garments that incorporated Fortnite’s cartoon-like aesthetic. The campaign was the first of its kind to merge digital and real-life experiences. It targeted Fortnite’s Gen Z user base and made the Balenciaga brand relevant and culturally significant to a new generation. Streetwear is a competitive branch of the fashion industry. Brands who stand out don’t just sell products—they create communities around their products, selling the complete lifestyle and status symbol. Use these streetwear marketing strategies to meet customers where they are. From inducing scarcity with product drops to experimenting with the metaverse, do it all with Shopify's all-in-one ecommerce platform for scaling stores. You can promote your streetwear brand by launching limited product drops, documenting your production process on TikTok, proving your commitment to sustainability, blending online and offline experiences, and collaborating with streetwear creators. To stand out, a streetwear brand should partner with content creators, sell a lifestyle instead of just products, back up sustainability claims, tap into nostalgia, and use experiential retail to build deeper connections with consumers. Gen Z are the largest demographic for streetwear, making up 70% of all customers. They are typically working professionals who are active on social media and have disposable income to spend on fashion.

Title: Refused to Raise Funds for Pro-Palestinian Causes During European Leg of Farewell Tour

Full Content:
Buckle up, folks. You’ll have a lot of words coming your way, but they’re the good kind of words. The ones with nothing but earnest intentions, that want to help people, not hurt them. While Refused are more know for their overbearing aural sounds, they’re aiming to contribute a bit more to society. A global society that needs it for sure. Now that the band is approaching the upcoming start of the European leg of their farewell tour, they’ve got a plan that involves them raising hella money to donate to pro-Palestinian causes across the land. Besides it being the right thing to do, their decision came after finding out information about some of the festivals they’re scheduled to play, and who might be financially backing those festivals. They call out KKR specifically, saying how they “invest in Israeli cyber security among other fucked up things.” Read the band’s lengthy but explanatory statement and action plan below: “So a week ago we found out that some of the festivals we’re playing this summer are backed by an entertainment conglomerate called Superstruct in which a bad bad actor named KKR is part owner. KKR invests in Israeli cyber security among other fucked up things. Our first instinct was to immediately jump ship, to boycott. We communicated this to the festivals and the organizers wrote back saying they shared our values and felt like we did, that they loved what they did and were proud of the festivals they’d created, that the majority of their audience would be sympathetic to our position and that they were gutted that bastards like KKR had bought into Superstruct after they started working with them, staining their life’s work by extension. One of them also questioned our other associations (cheeky, but he was right), saying that live nation are behind some other festivals and shows we’re playing, one of whose owners are Blackrock, a multinational heavily invested in weapons manufacturing, and that our music is on Spotify which donated money to Donald Trump’s inauguration and also invests in military AI. The scum of the earth basically. These festivals also told us they wanted us to make noise for the Palestinian cause, one of them even offered to give us a large amount of money just to donate to pro-Palestine organizations. So, the conundrum became: boycotting these festivals would make us feel good about ourselves, the band’s legacy wouldn’t be tarnished by association with these disgusting companies. it would feel nice. But it wouldn’t do any good; being morally superior doesn’t put food in the mouths of starving Palestinians. also, it wouldn’t make headlines; we’re not top billing on these festivals because, although we have a strong following within a specific subgenre of heavy music, we’re not a huge band. Some Swedish leftists sitting out a few festivals wouldn’t raise many eyebrows. We’ve mulled this over and although there’s a strong argument for taking a stand against KKR and this development of amoral private equity and hedge funds buying into the arts because it’s non-controversial and comparatively safe, it would be naive to think our boycott would even register for them. Rather the opposite, if people like that knew what we talked about on stage they would rather have us stay home, and with the charred bodies of Palestinians burned alive stacking up in the concentration camp/graveyard that Gaza has become, we have decided to make some noise, to go meet our people, to celebrate the resistance and raise money for the Palestinian cause this summer. To us, it is the right thing to do, to get out there and be a thorn in the side of Zionists, fascists, venture capitalists and to fan the flames of discontent together with our bright, informed comrades all over Europe. A lot of you have already bought tickets and are expecting us, so we’d love to get suggestions from local organizations and activists we could work with in all the countries and cities we’re playing. Free Palestine!!!” In a follow up post, they continued their statement with: “These kinds of deliberations are not new to us. In our late teens, coming out of the DIY underground, we were obsessed with ending our involvement in systemic oppression through the power of boycott, through spreading awareness of the human rights abuses in the countries that produced the consumer objects our generation coveted, the environmental impact of eating meat, the horrific abuses carried out by the USA in South America in order for us to have cheap bananas. These were all hot topics in the leftist punk underground at the time (and if we’re being self-critical for a moment, it’s obvious now that we were deluded in thinking that creating leftist utopias outside of the mainstream would achieve the great system change we were aiming for. Instead we left the parliaments to the neo-Nazis we used to fight in the streets [Antifa did the lion’s share of the fighting, but once or twice we fought them as a band, though most of the time we were too outnumbered and out-menaced to do shit], who gladly put on suits and toned their rhetoric down in order to gain power, an endeavor in which they succeeded beyond our wildest nightmares, as we can see all over the west right now), and it took us uneducated working class morons a while to learn what many picked up during two or three classes at UNI: that all of us in the west are complicit in the exploitation and subjugation of a huge part of the non-western world and while we worked hard to rid ourselves of this complicity by becoming incredibly conscious consumers, we slowly started to understand the immense machine of oppression that Europe and the US have constituted from the 1500s to this day, a fact that made our twenty-something consumer choices in the north of Sweden seem pretty insignificant. This didn’t deter us, but it definitely put us in check. What we quickly realized though was that we were always gonna be a gateway band. The underground community is a beautiful place, but after having seen the hundredth band preaching about the evils of capitalism or organized religion to a crowd of people dressed exactly the same as them, reading the same books, listening to the same bands, you start to wonder what the point really is: do we want to be right or do we want change? Refused was always a different animal than the pure, DIY or die-bands, and we did things they could not. That was kind of the point, to try and bring these ideas into the light. The centre-right government of Sweden gave us an award once (thank you @psl) and although we fucking hated their guts, we accepted the award just so we could stand right there in the corridors of power and ridicule them, humiliate them to their faces. There were minor deals with minor devils made, but through it all, we reached kids who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise: we turned a lot of people on to vegetarianism and veganism through our music, and there’s no counting the amount of people who have come up to us and said that our songs sowed the first seed of what grew to be a radical political life. It’s what we’re most proud of, the many activists, teachers, human rights lawyers, doctors and environmentalists for whom we were a companion (or even a stepping stone) on the way to a life of serving the greater good. They didn’t preach to the converted, they didn’t freak out about bar codes on CDs, they actually went out there and did shit. I guess what we’re trying to say is, these choices are not easy for us but we take them very seriously, and we’ve driven ourselves mad trying to bat a hundred in a crooked game. Which is why our next project will be DIY, more on that later…” Refused are sticking to their justice-forward, equal rights, mutual aid roots, and that’s what we need right now.

KKR invests in Israeli cyber security among other fucked up things. Our first instinct was to immediately jump ship, to boycott. We communicated this to the festivals and the organizers wrote back saying they shared our values and felt like we did, that they loved what they did and were proud of the festivals they’d created, that the majority of their audience would be sympathetic to our position and that they were gutted that bastards like KKR had bought into Superstruct after they started working with them, staining their life’s work by extension. One of them also questioned our other associations (cheeky, but he was right), saying that live nation are behind some other festivals and shows we’re playing, one of whose owners are Blackrock, a multinational heavily invested in weapons manufacturing, and that our music is on Spotify which donated money to Donald Trump’s inauguration and also invests in military AI. The scum of the earth basically. These festivals also told us they wanted us to make noise for the Palestinian cause, one of them even offered to give us a large amount of money just to donate to pro-Palestine organizations. So, the conundrum became: boycotting these festivals would make us feel good about ourselves, the band’s legacy wouldn’t be tarnished by association with these disgusting companies. it would feel nice. But it wouldn’t do any good; being morally superior doesn’t put food in the mouths of starving Palestinians. also, it wouldn’t make headlines; we’re not top billing on these festivals because, although we have a strong following within a specific subgenre of heavy music, we’re not a huge band. Some Swedish leftists sitting out a few festivals wouldn’t raise many eyebrows. We’ve mulled this over and although there’s a strong argument for taking a stand against KKR and this development of amoral private equity and hedge funds buying into the arts because it’s non-controversial and comparatively safe, it would be naive to think our boycott would even register for them. Rather the opposite, if people like that knew what we talked about on stage they would rather have us stay home, and with the charred bodies of Palestinians burned alive stacking up in the concentration camp/graveyard that Gaza has become, we have decided to make some noise, to go meet our people, to celebrate the resistance and raise money for the Palestinian cause this summer. To us, it is the right thing to do, to get out there and be a thorn in the side of Zionists, fascists, venture capitalists and to fan the flames of discontent together with our bright, informed comrades all over Europe. A lot of you have already bought tickets and are expecting us, so we’d love to get suggestions from local organizations and activists we could work with in all the countries and cities we’re playing. Free Palestine!!!” In a follow up post, they continued their statement with: “These kinds of deliberations are not new to us. In our late teens, coming out of the DIY underground, we were obsessed with ending our involvement in systemic oppression through the power of boycott, through spreading awareness of the human rights abuses in the countries that produced the consumer objects our generation coveted, the environmental impact of eating meat, the horrific abuses carried out by the USA in South America in order for us to have cheap bananas. These were all hot topics in the leftist punk underground at the time (and if we’re being self-critical for a moment, it’s obvious now that we were deluded in thinking that creating leftist utopias outside of the mainstream would achieve the great system change we were aiming for. Instead we left the parliaments to the neo-Nazis we used to fight in the streets [Antifa did the lion’s share of the fighting, but once or twice we fought them as a band, though most of the time we were too outnumbered and out-menaced to do shit], who gladly put on suits and toned their rhetoric down in order to gain power, an endeavor in which they succeeded beyond our wildest nightmares, as we can see all over the west right now), and it took us uneducated working class morons a while to learn what many picked up during two or three classes at UNI: that all of us in the west are complicit in the exploitation and subjugation of a huge part of the non-western world and while we worked hard to rid ourselves of this complicity by becoming incredibly conscious consumers, we slowly started to understand the immense machine of oppression that Europe and the US have constituted from the 1500s to this day, a fact that made our twenty-something consumer choices in the north of Sweden seem pretty insignificant. This didn’t deter us, but it definitely put us in check. What we quickly realized though was that we were always gonna be a gateway band. The underground community is a beautiful place, but after having seen the hundredth band preaching about the evils of capitalism or organized religion to a crowd of people dressed exactly the same as them, reading the same books, listening to the same bands, you start to wonder what the point really is: do we want to be right or do we want change? Refused was always a different animal than the pure, DIY or die-bands, and we did things they could not. That was kind of the point, to try and bring these ideas into the light. The centre-right government of Sweden gave us an award once (thank you @psl) and although we fucking hated their guts, we accepted the award just so we could stand right there in the corridors of power and ridicule them, humiliate them to their faces. There were minor deals with minor devils made, but through it all, we reached kids who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise: we turned a lot of people on to vegetarianism and veganism through our music, and there’s no counting the amount of people who have come up to us and said that our songs sowed the first seed of what grew to be a radical political life. It’s what we’re most proud of, the many activists, teachers, human rights lawyers, doctors and environmentalists for whom we were a companion (or even a stepping stone) on the way to a life of serving the greater good. They didn’t preach to the converted, they didn’t freak out about bar codes on CDs, they actually went out there and did shit. I guess what we’re trying to say is, these choices are not easy for us but we take them very seriously, and we’ve driven ourselves mad trying to bat a hundred in a crooked game. Which is why our next project will be DIY, more on that later…” Refused are sticking to their justice-forward, equal rights, mutual aid roots, and that’s what we need right now.

It’s what we’re most proud of, the many activists, teachers, human rights lawyers, doctors and environmentalists for whom we were a companion (or even a stepping stone) on the way to a life of serving the greater good. They didn’t preach to the converted, they didn’t freak out about bar codes on CDs, they actually went out there and did shit.

May 31, 2025 07:06 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Nvidia can't be stopped, Apple falls behind, and the AI data center race: Tech news roundup

Time Published: 2025-05-31T11:00:00Z

2 / 11 When Microsoft (MSFT) pulled the plug on planned data centers in Ohio last month and a Wells Fargo (WFC) report suggested Amazon (AMZN) Web Services was reconsidering some leases, market watchers quickly diagnosed the symptoms: AI bubble concerns, demand uncertainty, and the inevitable cooldown after years of breakneck expansion. Read More 3 / 11 The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks led the market’s post-pandemic boom. But as Big Tech sprints into the AI future, one big name is falling dangerously behind: Apple (AAPL). Once an undisputed tech heavyweight, it risks becoming the least magnificent of them all. Read More 4 / 11 Nvidia (NVDA) continues to go beyond expectations — even if things are a little more complicated this time around. Its strong first-quarter headline numbers show that Nvidia’s AI thesis is as strong as ever and that its margins remain elite, despite facing significant headwinds due to U.S. export restrictions on its H20 processors to China and other geopolitical concerns. Read More 5 / 11 A new study from Google Researchers is raising questions about whether quantum computing will hamper your ability to keep your crypto wallet secure. Google’s (GOOGL) Craig Gidney, a quantum research scientist, and Sophie Schmieg, a senior staff cryptography engineer, published a blog post on Friday showing a quantum computer could potentially break RSA encryption — the public-key encryption algorithm used to secure data such as for cryptocurrencies — with 20 times fewer quantum resources than they previously believed. Read More 6 / 11 Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei has issued a stark warning: Artificial intelligence could eliminate up to half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, pushing U.S. unemployment to 10–20% within the next one to five years. Read More 7 / 11 Nvidia’s (NVDA) delicate dance in China continues. Amid U.S. export restrictions on its advanced AI chips, the chip giant valued at $3.3 trillion is reworking its product line — again — to maintain its hold on one of its most important markets without crossing Washington. Read More 8 / 11 Salesforce said Tuesday it will acquire the cloud data management company Informatica for $8 billion in equity value as it seeks to further compete in the global artificial intelligence race. Read More 9 / 11 Most companies can’t shrug off an $8 billion loss. Then again, most companies aren’t Nvidia (NVDA). On Wednesday’s first-quarter earnings call, Wall Street zeroed in on Nvidia’s obvious weak spot: China. Thanks to U.S. export restrictions, Nvidia’s custom-built H20 chips, designed to skirt earlier rules, have essentially been made worthless. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress confirmed the damage: “Had the export controls not occurred, we would have had orders of about $8 billion for H20” in the quarter.

Title: Is Ethereum Preparing For A Move To $3,800? Analysts Predict Bullish Phase Ahead

Trading in the mid-$2,000 range, Ethereum (ETH) has repeatedly teased a move toward $3,000, only to fall short and retreat back into its current range. However, several crypto analysts remain confident that ETH’s ascent to $3,000 and beyond is only a matter of time. In a recent X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted ETH’s bullish price action. The analyst shared the following daily ETH chart, showing the cryptocurrency breaking out of a bullish flag following a period of consolidation – potentially setting its sights on a target of $3,800. Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto shared Titan’s outlook, saying that ETH is “holding up really well right now.” In a separate X post, the analyst added: It looks like a breakout is coming, and $3K is just around the corner. The fact that it’s outperforming #BTC this quarter is a strong sign that altcoin season is warming up. Meanwhile, crypto trader Jelle urged patience. Sharing the following chart of ETH’s recent price movement, he emphasized that ETH is behaving as expected as it continues to challenge a key resistance level. According to Jelle, the “real fun” will begin once ETH hits $3,000. Notably, ETH continues to attract strong institutional interest. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows for Ethereum topped $91 million yesterday, with BlackRock alone accounting for $50.4 million of that total – a clear sign of sustained confidence in the digital asset. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez also highlighted significant whale accumulation. According to Martinez, wallets holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 ETH acquired over 1 million ETH in the last 48 hours – a strong signal of long-term bullish sentiment. Large ETH ETF inflows and whale purchases signal rising institutional confidence and aggressive accumulation – trends that often precede bullish price action. By reducing the available supply on the market, these moves can help fuel upward momentum and price appreciation. From a technical standpoint, Ethereum is showing encouraging signs. Crypto trader Merlijn The Trader pointed out that ETH appears to be closely following the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern. In this pattern, the spring phase involves a false breakdown below support to shake out weak hands, followed by a test to confirm waning selling pressure. This sets the stage for the jump – a strong rally above resistance with significant volume, marking the start of a new uptrend. According to Merlijn, ETH has already completed the spring and test phases and is now poised to enter the jump phase – potentially setting the stage for a move toward a new all-time high (ATH). That said, all eyes are on the FTX creditor payouts expected later today. Experts warn that the massive $5 billion distribution could temporarily dampen ETH’s bullish momentum by increasing short-term selling pressure. At press time, ETH trades at $2,603, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Costco Stock Has a Big Price Tag. Some Investors Are Eyeing a Rare Split

Shoppers are fans of Costco’s prices. Could the warehouse giant’s stock get a smaller price tag, too? That’s on some investors’ minds lately, with shares of Costco Wholesale (COST) among the most-expensive—on a straightforward price-per-share basis—in the S&P 500: The stock, which closed Friday at around $1,040, was one of a dozen with a four-digit share price. (Topping the list, for those who track such things, was NVR (NVR), shares of which ended the week above $7,000 apiece.) Costco’s shares have gotten there in part due to a rise of roughly 25% over the past 12 months, and now there’s renewed chatter about whether the company might choose to split the stock. (Stock splits do nothing to the value of a company—broadly, a 10-for-1 split means that instead of one $100 share, you have 10 $10 shares—but they’re sometimes taken as a bullish signal.) “We remain upbeat on the company's ability to gain share going forward and believe shares are positioned for continued outperformance in the current backdrop. Catalysts from here, in our view, include a potential stock split,” Oppenheimer analysts—who have a bullish rating on the shares, along with a $1,130 price target that is above the Wall Street average as tracked by Visible Alpha—wrote late Thursday after Costco reported quarterly financial results. Talk of a Costco split bubbles up from time to time partly because the company rarely does them; it hasn’t happened since a two-for-one split in early 2000. Management was asked about splits at the company’s January shareholder meeting, with CEO Ron Vachris saying there was “nothing to report.” The company didn’t respond to Investopedia’s request for comment in time for publication. CFO Gary Millerchip on a December conference call said that making the shares comparatively cheap is less useful to investors now than in years past because of the availability of fractional shares. “But we do also recognize that there's a benefit of the stock feeling more affordable for our retail investors and employees who are very important constituents for us," he said. "So we'll continue to evaluate over time.”

Title: BI Investor of the Month: Meet the fund manager up 28% over the last year

Ankur Crawford, manager of the Alger Concentrated Equity ETF (CNEQ), is BI's Investor of the Month for May. Crawford's growth fund launched in April 2024 and has burst onto the scene. Over the last 12 months, it's up 30%, which was good enough to beat 96% of similar funds, according to Morningstar data. The S&P 500, by comparison, has returned 12% in that time. In May alone, CNEQ rose 17%. Crawford said the fund, which has 30 holdings, focuses on finding companies with little to no competition and, therefore, the ability to keep prices and profits high. "I would say 50% of the company would liken itself to being an oligopoly or a monopoly," she said. "A great example of that is we own Ferrari. There's only one Ferrari, and they can raise prices however much they want; they are still sold out for three years." Thematically, Crawford said the fund is betting big on artificial intelligence, which she called "one of the biggest opportunities that we see, probably of our generation." Despite sparking a market frenzy since late 2022, the AI trade is still in its early days, she said, and likely has legs for another 5-10 years. "It is a game-changing technology that is still in its infancy," she said. "What it will do to companies that furnish it and companies that are part of building out the infrastructure is significant." The top holdings in CNEQ reflect Crawford's affinity for AI: Nvidia (NVDA) has a 13.18% weighting, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) at 10.06%, Amazon (AMZN) at 9.27%, and Meta Platforms (META) at 6.1%. Crawford highlighted two companies in particular as leading the AI trade going forward, and that also fit her preference for monopoly or oligopoly firms: graphic processing unit maker Nvidia and semiconductor producer Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). While both have high valuations, they also have pricing power that's just about unmatched. "Being the only player in the world that can do something so important, I would argue TSM is probably the most strategic business on this planet," Crawford said. "That comes with a lot of rewards, including pricing power." Those considered for BI's Investor of the Month include managers of US-listed mutual funds or ETFs, those whose funds have outperformed peers in a given month, and those whose funds are outperforming a benchmark index (in most cases this will be the S&P 500) on a trailing 12-month basis.

IRISH RAIL HAS announced that its services between Dublin’s Connolly Station and Dún Laoghaire will be unavailable this weekend as commuters flock to a series of bank holiday events. Between today and Monday, 2 June, restrictions and alterations will apply to both rail and bus services because of limited capacity due to annual summer gatherings such as the Bloom festival and the VHI Women’s Mini Marathon taking place. Here are the main changes to note across the primary public transport services. A revised timetable will be in place for the weekend, with Monday’s times operating as Sunday schedules for Dart and commuter services. Dart services between Connolly Station and Dún Laoghaire will be unavailable due to major works on the line between Connolly and Blackrock which will also impact Rosslare Intercity services. However, rail tickets on affected routes are valid on Dublin Bus. Dart services are operating between Malahide/Howth and Connolly, and between Dún Laoghaire and Bray/Greystones. All other rail services are also off between Connolly and Dún Laoghaire for the entire bank holiday weekend, and Rosslare services will be operating from Bray only. (You can find full details here). Advertisement Irish Rail is reminding customers to pre-book tickets to ensure a seat on intercity trains because of high demand on Heuston-bound rail for the purpose of attending the Bord Bia Bloom festival in Dublin’s Phoenix Park. Some Dublin-bound trains from Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford are already fully booked, so additional trains will operate out of Cork and Galway to accommodate passenger numbers heading to Bloom Extra early trains from Cobh, Midleton and Mallow will be laid on to provide for high numbers attending the Cork City Marathon on Sunday. The company says all services will operate to a Sunday schedule this weekend. This will include Dublin’s Expressway services serving Ballina, Cavan, Donegal, Dundalk, Letterkenny, Monaghan, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford as well as serving Cork, Galway, Limerick and Tralee. Customers are strongly advised to pre-book their tickets and allow for delays if heading to and from Dublin Airport on Expressway due to holidaymakers jetting abroad. The VHI Women’s Mini Marathon in the capital will cause road closures, so Bus Éireann says people must check service updates on its website for the latest travel information. The company’s Monday service will operate to a Sunday schedule. Its Nitelink service will continue today, but will not be in place tomorrow. Customers are told to be aware of traffic diversions in place across the city to facilitate the Women’s Mini Marathon tomorrow. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Dublin is ridiculous. Here's why I still love it
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/05/31/ruby-eastwood-why-would-anyone-choose-to-live-in-a-city-as-ridiculous-as-dublin/
Time Published: 2025-05-31T05:30:00Z
Full Content:
You hear stories about how people survive in this impossibly expensive city. Couples who stay in loveless relationships because they can’t afford to separate. Strangers from Facebook groups sleeping in the same room. A bed rented by one person in the day and a different person at night. Tenants paying their landlords with sex. Artists squatting illegally in their studios. People sleeping in storage units. These stories are full of human ingenuity and degradation. They’re really quite strange when you think about them properly. The strangest part is how common they’ve become. [ Ireland’s rising rents: ‘Our budget would have been €1,300 a month, there isn’t even anything listed for that’Opens in new window ] About a year ago, my best friend in Dublin moved to Berlin, where he says it’s still possible to be broke and live well. When he left his damp, windowless room near Connolly Station – which cost just under a thousand euros a month – there were people queuing for the privilege of being next. Now he lives in a sunlit attic for a fraction of the price, and drinks Fritz Colas and Berliner Pilsners on the rooftop. Every so often, during our calls, he tries to convince me to join him. His logic is hard to fault: Dublin is untenable. Unless you have private wealth or can stomach a corporate job, you resign yourself to chronic financial dread – the kind that squats over your life like Fuseli’s goblin in the painting. At least in other expensive cities, such as New York or London, you can escape your overpriced room into a pulsing metropolis, with endless distractions and some of them free. In Dublin, all you can really do is go to the pub, and even that costs too much. The city is very small, and it seems to constrict as the years pass. You can’t leave the house without seeing a face you know. In fact, there are no faces you don’t know. They approach from all sides. And the rain. The constant rain. I recognise the truth in this, and it’s hard to argue with. Why would anyone choose to live in such a ridiculous city? I don’t know if I really understand my own reasons for staying. I suspect they’re quite shameful: they have more to do with a romantic or aesthetic impulse than with anything practical. I just like Dublin. I like the harsh beaches and the Martello towers. The silvery, rinsed-out light. I like walking through the sprawling industrial wastelands on the city’s fringes. I like the canals in spring, all fragrant with weeds and strewn with sunk bicycles. Strangers here seem to want to tell you things – like the old lady who, for no discernible reason, wanted to talk about the time she heard Bob Marley singing Redemption Song at Dalymount Park. You witness things. Once, on Talbot Street, I saw a man with an arm in a cast get into a physical fight with a man on crutches. I like Dublin on the rare occasions when it snows. I like the hot, malty smell from the Guinness factory. I like the Liberties, where you can hear the quiet rush of subterranean rivers, and church bells, and horses’ hooves. I like that ugly statue of Oscar Wilde with the pervert’s smile. I even like the loud, sentimental music on Grafton Street, and the whiskey-soaked ballads streaming from the pubs in Temple Bar. The idea of leaving Dublin becomes more, not less, appealing as I become more entrenched here ... we can weather all sorts of adversity, but banal contentment is the real deadener Mainly, though, I like Dublin because I chose it. The first time I visited, I was 21. I had some half-baked but very attractive notion of what Ireland represented: something to do with resistance, with migration and nostalgia and alcoholism. I had a copy of Finnegans Wake and I think I got about three pages in on the bus ride into town before falling asleep. When I woke up, I scrambled off and left the book behind. I had oysters for lunch that day and pictured my whole life in the city. It felt just the right size to make mine. I’ve lived in bigger cities: Barcelona, where I grew up, and London, where I lived before coming here; and smaller, random places: Brighton, Siena. I’ve spoken to quite a few Dubliners who are desperate to move to other European cities and can’t understand my decision to stay. There’s a kind of faith involved in choosing a city. You respond to its atmosphere, its pace and texture, the way it opens up to you – or doesn’t. Dublin, for all its flaws, felt like it might yield something if I stayed long enough. The beginning in a new place is always the hardest part: slow, bitty, full of doubts. I didn’t know anyone. I’d been accepted into a master’s programme but couldn’t fund it and had to defer my place by a year. When my sublet ended, I had to return to London for a while because I couldn’t find another room. I worked in bars and signed up with a temp agency that sent me on scattershot catering shifts around the city. The jobs were mostly tedious, but they offered a kind of education. I learned how the different bits of the city fit together, like a giant jigsaw. The glassy conference rooms down by the Quays. The Leopardstown racecourse, where West End men come on weekends to get extravagantly drunk. The grand Georgian hotels and restaurants, where they throw out so much good food it makes you want to cry. The methadone clinic at the end of the bus line where you hear the wildest conversations and sometimes get drawn in. [ Dublin: The 13th best city in the world ... supposedlyOpens in new window ] It occurs to me that the difficulty of establishing yourself in a city confers a special kind of meaning on your relationship to it. Like in a toxic romance, if you can weather the lows, the highs are incredible. Who knows – maybe the expensiveness and impossibility of a place like Dublin, far from being deterrents, actually deepen its appeal, the way we fetishise designer handbags but never their identical fakes. I’ve always had this wrong-headed idea that the value of something is revealed by the sting of its attendant sacrifice. Gradually, my life in Dublin took on more solidity. I was lucky enough to receive a university grant. I met people. I signed a lease. I moved in with a friend and we painted all the walls fresh white. She bought velvet floral curtains in pastel colours and hung them in the livingroom. I found a few prints in charity shops. I got a Persian carpet from a lady in Blackrock Market. A friend gave me a desk she no longer needed. Sometimes the city sends you little signs of progress. The quiet, stoical man in the corner shop at the end of my road has started calling me “honey”, and occasionally smiles. I have a friend’s spare keys on my keyring. I know the name of my neighbour’s dog. I know which cobbler to go to for the best deal. Still, there are days when I fantasise about leaving. It would be nice to buy lunch in a cafe without feeling frivolous. It would be wonderful not to feel like I’m stuck in a recurring nightmare every time rent comes around. Oddly, the idea of leaving Dublin becomes more, not less, appealing as I become more entrenched here. Maybe that’s no coincidence. To return to the toxic romance analogy: we can weather all sorts of adversity, but banal contentment is the real deadener. Recently, I spoke to a friend in London who’s moving to Iowa City for a master of fine arts degree. He told me he’s spent hours on Google Maps, exploring the place through Street View. The images all seem to have been captured on sunny days – it looks green and beautiful, full of classic American wood-frame houses. He’s begun to associate the town with Iowa Dream by Arthur Russell, all melodic guitar lines and soft lyrics. The self he pictured living there was different from the one he knows in London: less anxious, more social, content to spend long afternoons drifting around and hanging out with friends. [ Trevor White: I love Dublin. But there’s no point in pretending it’s a great small cityOpens in new window ] I also indulge in this kind of cartographic dreaming. I explore prospective cities on Street View: Beirut, Paris, Berlin. It’s a surreal activity. You pick a spot on the map and drag yourself along, imagining a parallel life. Sometimes, from one click to the next, the sun disappears and rain slicks the tarmac. Figures with blurred faces vanish or are replaced by others in different clothes further down the road. You realise the map is stitched together from footage taken on different days, in different moods. Another thing my friend hinted at stayed with me: that emigration can be indistinguishable from escapism. When I imagine myself in another city, I don’t picture myself as I am now, but a physically and intellectually tweaked version. In Paris, I’m gaunt with a perfect bob; I smoke straights and read Lacan for pleasure. In Beirut, I am somehow fluent in Arabic; I drink less; I am sharper and more spiritual. I study ancient manuscripts. In Berlin, I am reunited with my best friend and we live together like Robert Mapplethorpe and Patti Smith before it all fell apart, looking cool and making great art. The fantasy isn’t really about the new city. It’s about becoming a new person. [ Emer McLysaght: Five lessons Dublin can learn from ZurichOpens in new window ] There’s a way of reading this that feels a little bleak. You could say it reflects a kind of ambient self-disgust, or an inability to accept life as it is. A symptom of being stuck in the wheel of samsara: trapped in a cycle of craving and disappointment, forever projecting some improved self just over the horizon, never quite admitting that the old self follows you everywhere. There’s truth in that, but it’s not the whole story. There’s another, more generous way to see it. Maybe it isn’t escapism, but a kind of unconscious recognition that we are always in the process of becoming. Cities aren’t just stages on which our lives play out. They are the biggest collaborators. They shape how we speak, how we move, how we think. They alter our trajectories. When you choose to stay in a place, you’re submitting to its influence. To live in a city is to enter into a kind of contract. You agree to spend your time, your energy, and your labour in its service. In return, it promises transformation, but on its own terms. Like the enchanted gift in a fairy tale, the city will change you in ways you can’t predict, and not all of them will be kind. The point is you don’t get to choose. It’s a gamble. Is it one worth taking? Ruby Eastwood is a writer living in Dublin © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Apple CEO Tim Cook miscalculates, goes quiet as his influence with President Trump fades
URL: https://macdailynews.com/2025/05/30/apple-ceo-tim-cook-miscalculates-goes-quiet-as-his-influence-with-president-trump-fades/
Time Published: 2025-05-30T21:37:24Z
Full Content:
Update font size. Reset Before President Donald Trump’s recent Middle East trip, the White House invited CEOs and representatives from numerous U.S. companies to accompany him. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, chose not to attend, according to two sources familiar with the matter. This decision seemed to irritate President Trump. During his visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, he made several remarks critical of Mr. Cook and Apple. Tripp Mickle for The New York Times: ‎ During his speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump paused to praise Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, for traveling to the Middle East along with the White House delegation. Then he knocked Mr. Cook. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Huang at an event attended by chief executives like Larry Fink of the asset manager BlackRock, Sam Altman of OpenAI, Jane Fraser of Citigroup and Lisa Su of the semiconductor company AMD. Later in Qatar, Mr. Trump said he “had a little problem with Tim Cook.” The president praised Apple’s investment in the United States, then said he had told Mr. Cook, “But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.” On Friday morning, Mr. Trump caught much of his own administration and Apple’s leadership off guard with a social media post threatening tariffs of 25 percent on iPhones made anywhere except the United States. The post thrust Apple back into the administration’s cross hairs… Nu Wexler, principal at Four Corners Public Affairs and a former Washington policy communications executive at Google and Facebook, said Mr. Cook’s “very public relationship” with Mr. Trump has backfired. “It has put Apple at a disadvantage because every move, including a potential concession from Trump, is scrutinized,” Mr. Wexler said. Because Mr. Trump didn’t “have much incentive to either go easy on Apple or cut a deal on tariffs,” he said, “the incentive to crack down is much stronger.” The timing of the White House’s new tariff plan couldn’t be worse for Mr. Cook, who has led Apple for nearly 14 years. Last month, the company suffered a stinging defeat in an App Store trial. The judge in the trial rebuked Apple executives, saying they had “outright lied under oath” and that “Cook chose poorly,” and ruled that Apple had to change how it operates the App Store. Jony Ive, Apple’s former chief designer who became estranged from Mr. Cook and left the company in 2019, joined OpenAI last week to build a potential iPhone competitor. Its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, released in January 2024 to fanfare, has been a disappointment. And in March, Apple postponed its promised release of a new Siri, raising fresh doubts about its ability to compete in the industry’s race to adopt artificial intelligence. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Apple needed a new CEO at least a decade ago. Instead, the endless iteration parade continues, with each year’s entries now unveiled via canned videos, growing ever more tiresome, diffused with ever more vapor, as each new paradigm shift is blindly missed by an aging, boring-as-beige CEO surrounded by burnt-out, surfeited VPs. We’ve long been the canaries in the coal mine. This lack of focus, lack of attention to detail, lack of striving for perfection will catch up to Apple eventually if it is not arrested and corrected in time. So – sigh – we once again present to Apple CEO Tim Cook, where the buck supposedly stops, the Trophy for Misplaced Priorities: The Misplaced Priorities Trophy — MacDailyNews, November 29, 2017 Apple is not firing on all cylinders. The quality has been slipping for years and the mistakes, bad designs, stupid decisions, product delays and worse have been piling up. – MacDailyNews, May 18, 2017 Steve Jobs is irreplaceable, but someone with vision, taste, and focus is what’s required here. The magic of Steve Jobs was vision, focus on the products from the user’s point of view, fastidious attention to detail, and next-level marketing acumen. – MacDailyNews, January 29, 2018 Steve Jobs could make a power cord seem insanely great. Tim Cook could put a room to sleep while unveiling teleportation; he makes watching paint dry seem like must-see event. Apple is currently helmed by a charisma black hole. Sparks are therefor not emitted. Lacking a charismatic leader who could sell ice cubes to eskimos, execution is the key. High quality products and services that just work with timely updates in sufficient supply at launch… Apple’s issues with late, old, sometimes problematic products and services do more to dampen excitement and devotion than anything. – MacDailyNews, January 4, 2019 You know, some people get upset when we point out that Tim Cook is a boring, reactive caretaker who’s not really the best person to be running Apple today or for at least the past several years. Operations manager Cook should have been a 3-5 year stopgap after Steve Jobs’ untimely passing, running the iteration playbook, providing continuity for the company while it found a real CEO. Instead, he hung on — and keeps hanging on — well past his sell-by date. – MacDailyNews, August 22, 2024 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

With watchOS 11.5, Apple once again leads with a new Pride watch face. At this point, how many do we need? It feels like every update is more about social signaling than product improvement. We’ve got powerful health features, training tools, and performance updates… but the spotlight is always on Pride. Can every belief or identity get this kind of platform? Or just the ones Apple chooses? I miss when Apple led with innovation, not ideology. Pretty sure Steve Jobs would’ve kept the focus on the product. We now have enough Pride watch face and band iterations to wrap every Pride-wearing Apple Watch around the globe 8 times. Yes, I did the math (estimated). And more than the population of the world. Meanwhile Donald is on a golf course fudging his score. Sounds like you should switch to Windows since you are so offended that Cook isn’t kissing the fat ass of your favorite mob boss. Apple will be just fine, if it continues to act with respect and good faith with its suppliers and customers. Of course Timmy has always flown the gay pride flag, it’s who he is. Who cares. It doesn’t hurt anyone. The USA, however, is burning the bridges with all its former allies, and will be in recession or stagflation soon as the unilaterally stupid trade restrictions take effect. It will take years to recover. And no, neither Canada nor Greenland is ever going to become a US state. The insulting proposals to take over sovereign territories is beyond insulting. How much longer must we endure the caretaker which is Tim Cook? And becoming a broken record… Failed Car Program Failing Vision Pro program completely Missed AI and in rapid catch-up mode – if possible. Dude managed for 5-7 years too long at the helm. Need a visionary and innovator to lead the way and Cook ain’t it. Duh… Any suggestions? Because the best people are running their own companies and aren’t going to take a pay and power cut to run Apple. Jobs himself handpicked Cook to succeed him apparently without any consideration for him being a short-term “caretaker” CEO. The idea of the top person being the creative trailblazer is also a distortion. What’s important is for leaders to hire good lieutenants, delegate and allow for creative freedom. Don’t tell me there aren’t MANY brilliant people at Apple who for systemic reasons don’t have enough sway. Maybe Cook is the bottleneck but there’s no silver-bullet unicorn free agent out there. Craig Federighi would be a logical choice but who knows if he’s a good enough leader to run the entire organization. I heard from someone who met him that he’s an a-hole “do you know who I am?” but then again so was Jobs so it might be a good fit. Bringing an outsider who has no experience in Apple’s culture and structure could make things much worse, be careful what you wish for… Best to stay clear of the chaos that is the White House. MacDaily has become a Trump mouthpiece rather than a Mac-centric news site. People outside the USA can see what’s happening and now working around the chaos. The business performance of Cook in his worst year is substantially more successful AND SUSTAINABLE than the 6x bankrupt, 31x felon that this site worships. Speaking of waning influence … when Donald loses his last appeal for his attempts to take dictatorial power, including of course the power of taxation, away from the peoples’ representatives …. youll see manbaby melt down like the empty suit he is. All the reforms that could have been passed easily through the Republican legislature aren’t happening, because they are almost as inept as the Executive. So easily rescinded exec memos will be reversed in 3 years, and hopefully someone with fiscal responsibility will also undo the reckless spending AND reckless destruction of international trade. The USA has been severe crippled by the make-it-up-as-we-go diplomacy , the vindictive international diplomacy, and the now record debts this administration has presided over. Every nation in the world is now working hard to replace the USA as a trading partner, because nobody can trust the POTUS to keep his word. Awww… I bet you were so happy while the country under the senile idiot walking cadaver was in the WH. When he allowed MILLIONS of illegals in to country, did NOTHING to stop Russia to invade Ukraine, the economy in shambles while wasting BILLIONS in woke BS. Wrong. Biden, who actually nominated a competent staff which passed congressional reviews without controversy, urged congress to support Ukraine with weapons. Now Trump has halted the deals, which were profitable to the USA as well as successful in halting Russian ground advances, since Trump thinks he can bargain with his old buddy Putin. Turns out Trump can’t solve anything with “just a phone call”. Trump looks like an idiot, untrusted by both adversaries. Letting Putin become emperor of the former USSR with new allies North Korea and China would be the worst possible outcome of the situation. No US president has taken the necessary actions to strengthen US-European ties to ensure democracy survives in Eastern Europe. But feckless Donny has done a bang-up job destroying everyone’s confidence in the USA. Donny is happy to bomb Yemen but just doesn’t have the balls to fight communism or even help those countries who are. Or, in this case, since communism no longer exists, it is now Russian oligarchs’ fascism wrapped in a red flag. Something Donald has repeatedly claimed to admire. So much for the USA supporting the expansion of democracy in the world. Donny must really have enjoyed all those extra curricular activities at his pageants in Moscow, now he’s selling out the efforts of 4 generations of Americans who fought and died to prevent communist takeover of the world. Pathetic. After years of daily visits to MacDailyNews I am leaving it. Its zeal for the disgusting person at the White House is beyond endurance Good riddance Don’t see the “zeal” you describe. It’s invisible. I do see a lot of very warranted criticism of the current management of Apple. We have a president who virtually never thinks rationally, logically, or even in sequential steps. Nor can he fully comprehend causes and effects. His base of knowledge on virtually all subjects relating to governance and economics and world affairs is minimal. He lacks empathy, conscience, morality, and remorse for the wrongs he commits. He is a pathological liar. He has severe and destructive personality disorders-narcissism, sociopathy, and paranoia. He speaks at the level of a fifth-grader, at best. He can barely spell and do simple math. And his already limited mental capacity deteriorates with each passing day. No one has lasting influence with this idiot. The prior one actually had no capacity to think! LOL Too bad Biff Tannen has no such thing as a brain… Almost half of Americans are too blind and brainless to notice that evidence, alas! WTF?! Obama has been out of the White House for quite a while now. Why bring him up other than the fact he was controlling Sleepy Joe. Sorry, but there was an election last November, and the man you described is no longer President. A guy named Trump won, and he is really making strides. He’s correcting all of Biden’s disasters. “We have a president who virtually never thinks rationally bla bla bla…” Your diatribe is based on nothing as usual. What we have now is a President with the courage and tenacity to actually do something other than kick the can down the road and I am grateful. Tim Cook FAILED. He, who incredibly, took Apple from $1B (they called it bankrupt in 1998) to the first $1T, first $2T, first $3T co. in history, nearly wasted his entire legacy, by reducing his iQ to putting all his eggs in 1 basket, China. During C-19, China shut down factories for months, Apple desperately sought outsourcing to alternatives in India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam etc. but is it too late and are Westerners too closed-minded/short-sighted/immature/infantile/naive to not think China would retaliate by moving out of their country? Tim met TRUMP so many times, yet still is the most affected by tariffs, making Apple suffer the biggest drop in years, so what is the point of Tim being close to T and where is his/Apple’s leverage?! How useful is Tim now? Is his presidency as dormant/senile as Biden’s? Tim could have been fired by iSteve, who did elect him, since Tim did not use Apple’s mojo since iSteve 2011-10-05, but only used iteration, updates, not even upgrades on all products. Tim Cook feel ASLEEP at the wheel, failed AppleCar “Project Titan” (2000>20204-02-27), failed iWatch cam, failed Apple Mail, failed Apple social media, failed Search engine, failed HomePod, SmartHome, failed ai etc. Perhaps Tim’s biggest miss is having let go of JONY IVE? Apple losing its soul/dna/mojo for 14 years since iSteve left an ambience of zero interest for Jony, who left 2019-07. Now Jony sells LoveFrom (off’l; Neo-Bauhaus? ; ) unnamed but prototyped AI hardware (release 2027?) to OpenAI, when he could have made it for Apple, which in so many recent failures could’ve gained its next iPhone moment & saved its mojo! Will the AI neck device by Jony/Altman, as a first in series of OpenAI hardware, kill Apple/Meta/Goo/Msft/Xiaomi/Huawei like an unexpected tsunami, as they figured out the perfect balance for the elixir or alchemy of iDevices, that defies gravity & flummoxes all competitors that go the wrong way… Of course, it is certainly not a pride to keep contact with a dangerous liar who plays with his country and the world as if it were a Monopoly game… First apple needs to return to live WWDC event. No pre recorded presentation, everything needs to be a live demo. No more DEI representation at the WWDC. Put the people forward that actual have ideas and can lead a talk without a teleprompter. Apple has turned into a fake mockery of their old self. First step on the road to recovery is return to live people. No more social engineered fake presentations by clueless people chosen as a diversity check box. Whhaaaaattt? Greasing Taco Don’s paw with a million bucks doesn’t endear him to the convicted felon? Sucking up to him – but not enough, apparently? Maybe Timmy shouldn’t have expected loyalty from a guy who measures that in time-stamped dollars. Giving him a million bucks months ago; jeez, that expired just about immediately. Trump is trashing America “the brand” worldwide. Tourism to USA down, American product purchases are cratering in Europe. The world is pivoting away from American goods and services…. And i suspect it will continue whilst the Trump is at the helm. It’s making you “Think Stupid”. A take on Apple’s “Think Different”, as some MDN commenters have gone from that Apple philosophy, to not thinking at all, the TDS philosophy. Take a hard look at the ossified, glad-handing, CYA, elitist Board of Directors. There was a time when Board Members were intelligent, insightful, people who actually created new stuff. Now, at best, the Board Members just administrated stuff created ages ago by others. Caretaking is their stock in trade. Boring. Your email address will not be published.

This week: GameStop sinks after buying a boatload of Bitcoin, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF continues flying high, and Metaplanet makes a potentially risky sprint to amass a lot of BTC very quickly. GameStop Bitcoin flop GameStop found out this week that sinking half a billion dollars into Bitcoin isn’t universally flattering for share prices. The video game retailer spent $512 million on Bitcoin earlier this week, and the GME share price climbed as high as $35.78 the morning the BTC buy was announced. But it fell sharply the same day and still hasn’t recovered. GME closed Friday at $29.80—nearly 17% lower than that short-lived Wednesday peak. Now, don’t get us wrong: The revival of Trump tariff trouble has dealt a blow to crypto assets and securities alike. But GME was deep into its post-Bitcoin buy slide before an appeals court ruled that Trump’s tariff policies would remain in place. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter—the only Wall Streeter who still officially covers GME—told Barron’s that he’s not sold on GameStop being an attractive buy because of its Bitcoin ambitions. “It doesn't make sense to me that [GameStop] would be a 'better' steward of Bitcoin holdings,” he said. Pachter pointed out that the retailer is in no position to weather having a large portion of its treasury sitting in a volatile asset. For example, if Bitcoin were to drop 30% to about $70,000—a price it’s seen as recently as October—that would leave GME with an unrealized loss equal to its past four quarters of operating income. Interestingly, in April, Strive CEO Matt Cole highlighted purported infighting at GameStop over its Bitcoin strategy. But his advice that the company buy as much Bitcoin as it can, as quickly as possible, hasn’t aged particularly well. IBIT euphoria The BlackRock Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, pulled in more than $6.22 billion in net deposits this month to make this its best month on record—and that’s before the closing bell has rung on the last trading day in May. It helps, of course, that Bitcoin flirted with and then set a few new all-time high price marks. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out on X that it’s not a typical trajectory for a newly launched fund. “IBIT on fire lately, now has $72B in assets which ranks it 23rd overall, absolutely bonkers for a one-year-old,” he wrote. The fund has been so dominant that it’s accounted for 90% of all spot Bitcoin ETF flows in the past month. As a group, the twelve ETFs account for more than 6% of the circulating 19.8 million Bitcoin supply. But at $70.2 billion, IBIT accounts for 55% of the total $126 billion worth of assets under management by the issuers. But the milestone underscores what critics like Rep. Mike Flood (R-NE) say is a unique risk: There are only four different custodians used by the issuers to hold the Bitcoin that backs ETF shares. “This concern is amplified by the fact that none of the custodians are banks,” he wrote in a statement in February. At the time, he cited the SEC’s recently rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121. Despite the rule being rescinded, there hasn’t been much change in the lineup. Many of the issuers—including BlackRock, Grayscale, WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, and Valkyrie—use Coinbase Custody. The Invesco and Galaxy fund uses Galaxy as its custodian, but some of that BTC gets routed to Coinbase as a sub-custodian. BlackRock added Anchorage Digital as an additional custodian for its IBIT and ETHA funds in April. Fidelity self-custodies the BTC backing shares of its Fidelity Bitcoin Trust, or FBTC, which is the next-largest fund. Metaplanet sprints—but at what cost? Japanese Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet is running, not walking, towards its goal of acquiring 10,000 BTC by the end of the year. That’s over $1 billion worth at the current price. With another buy earlier this week, Metaplanet now holds 7,800 Bitcoin. But that has, very literally, come at a cost to the company: Its debt-to-equity ratio has climbed to 8.43, according to Reuters. For context, the same ratio for Strategy—the company it’s trying to emulate—was 0.24 as of March 2025. There aren’t many comparisons we could make that would leave Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin juggernaut looking conservative after acquiring some $60 billion worth of BTC, but this is one of them. If Metaplanet’s game plan works out, then it could amplify returns for investors. But if Bitcoin tanks, then it could blow up spectacularly.

It is loosely based on Blackrock's cbsdk, but shares no code nor is pycbsdk supported by Blackrock. pycbsdk's API design is intended to mimic that of a C-library. Indeed, a primary goal of this library is to help prototype libraries in other languages. After all, Python is a poor choice to handle high throughput data without some compiled language underneath doing all the heavy lifting. However, it's pretty useful as is! And so far it has been good-enough for some quick test scripts, and it even drops fewer packets than CereLink. So, please use it, and contribute! We are more than happy to see the API expand to support more features, or even to have an additional "pythonic" API. Upon initialization, the NSPDevice instance configures its sockets (but no connection yet), it allocates memory for its mirror of the device state, and it registers callbacks to monitor config state. When the connection to the device is established, two threads are created and started: connect() has startup_sequence=True by default. This will cause the SDK to attempt to put the device into a running state. Otherwise, it'll stay in its original run state.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs see $358 mln exit – First outflow after 10-day inflow streak ends

Fidelity and Grayscale ETFs lead redemptions, while BlackRock and ETH funds maintain strong momentum. After a strong 10-day run of consistent inflows totaling over $4.26 billion, U.S. spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs faced a sharp reversal with $346.8 million in net outflows as per Farside Investors. This marks the largest daily withdrawal since 11th March, highlighting renewed investor caution. On a day marked by significant outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the exit with $166 million pulled out. This was followed closely by Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw $107.5 million in net redemptions. Several other funds, including those from Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck, also experienced capital flight. Interestingly, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) went against the wider market movement by drawing in $125 million in net inflows. This extended its impressive 34-day streak of daily inflows, with its total inflow nearing $49 billion and assets under management now topping $70 billion. In contrast to the recent downturn in Bitcoin ETF flows, spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs continued to attract investor interest, recording $92 million in net inflows on the 29th of May alone. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) recorded more than $50 million in fresh inflows, raising its total to $4.5 billion since launching in July 2024. Seeing this, ETF Store President Nate Geraci had mentioned that this activity coincides with a broader trend, as over the past five weeks, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more than $9 billion, while gold ETFs have seen nearly $3 billion in outflows. With Bitcoin’s price slipping from $111K to around $105,615, the recent market correction may be fueling the shift in ETF momentum. The evolving market cycle appears to be increasingly driven by growing institutional involvement, particularly following the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. This shift has reshaped investor sentiment and market dynamics. Reflecting on this trend, CryptoQuant founder Ji Young Ju acknowledged a misjudged bear market prediction made in early 2025, only to witness Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high just two months later. Young Ju put it best when he said, “It feels like it’s time to throw out that cycle theory. New liquidity sources and volume are becoming more uncertain, signalling a transition as the Bitcoin market merges with TradFi.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is reportedly continuing to add data centers after opening a cluster of them in Mexico earlier this year. The company is building new facilities in Chile, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, AWS CEO Matt Garman said, per a Friday (May 30) Bloomberg News report. As it works to increase its capacity to power artificial intelligence, AWS also aims to expand its stock of Nvidia’s latest semiconductor, the GB200, according to the report. “Demand is strong,” Garman said. PYMNTS reported in April that Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at AWS, said in a LinkedIn post that the company continues to see “strong demand for both generative AI and foundational workloads.” At the time of that report, AWS had 114 availability zones and plans for 12 more in 36 global regions that serve 245 countries and territories. An AWS spokesperson told PYMNTS in April that availability zones refer to a cluster of one or more discrete data centers. AWS does not disclose its actual data center count. In January, AWS said it plans to invest at least $11 billion in Georgia to expand infrastructure to support cloud computing and AI. “AWS’s ongoing infrastructure investments across the United States demonstrate our relentless commitment to powering our customers’ digital innovation through cloud and AI technologies,” Roger Wehner, vice president of economic development at AWS, said at the time in a press release. The server market is expected to hit $1.3 trillion by 2028, according to a January report by IDC. The biggest builders of data centers include Amazon, Microsoft and Google Cloud as well as data center companies Digital Realty and Equinix. AI data centers are needed because traditional data centers and power grids are struggling to accommodate the intense computational power, data storage and energy required by AI. It was reported May 21 that one of OpenAI’s future data centers secured $11.6 billion in funding commitments. The center, which is being constructed in the Texas community of Abilene, is slated for completion next year and is set to become the ChatGPT maker’s largest. In March, xAI and Nvidia joined a $30 billion AI infrastructure project called the AI Infrastructure Fund, which is backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and MGX.

Title: 6 Minutes Of Retail Trader Research Drives 20% Of Stock Market Volume

More Robinhood, walk along Wall Street after going public with an IPO earlier in the day on July 29, 2021 in New York City. Robinhood Markets Inc. shares fell about 5% during its Nasdaq debut. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) New research reveals retail investors spend just six minutes researching stocks before trading, yet their collective behavior is increasingly driving market movements as trading volumes surge and buy-the-dip strategies become more aggressive. The stereotype of the hurried retail investor making split-second decisions based on little more than a hunch has been confirmed by groundbreaking academic research. A study by Jeffrey Wurgler, Nomura Professor of Finance at NYU Stern, and his colleagues found that the median retail investor spends just six minutes conducting internet-based research before making a stock trade. This finding takes on new significance as retail investors have become increasingly bold in their market behavior. Recent data from J.P. Morgan shows individual investors net bought a record $4.7 billion worth of equities in a single day during April’s market selloff, the highest daily inflow in a decade. This "buy-the-dip" mentality has strengthened dramatically since 2022, marking a behavioral shift from the panic selling witnessed during the March 2020 market crash. The influence of individual investors has grown substantially, with retail trading now accounting for roughly 20% of total market volume. This is double the levels seen a decade ago. Trading app downloads surged during the pandemic, with platforms like Robinhood reporting millions of new accounts, while Interactive Brokers recently saw a 44% increase in options orders following market volatility. Wurgler's research, which analyzed eight million rows of browser data from individual investors, reveals troubling patterns in how retail traders conduct research. The study found that investors overwhelmingly focus on price charts rather than fundamental analysis, with the most common lookback period being just a single day. "It caters to the lowest common denominator of research ability," Wurgler explained in a recent podcast interview. "We understand stocks, we want them to go up. And if we see a picture in which the stock is going up today, well, that's more satisfying than something that's flat or something that's slightly down." This focus on short-term price movements is particularly striking given that most investors in the study held their positions for several weeks. The disconnect between research timeframe and holding period suggests a fundamental misalignment in investment approach. The research uncovered another significant finding: Yahoo Finance dominates retail investor research, serving as the primary information source for millions of traders. This concentration creates what Wurgler calls a feedback loop, where the information presented on the platform's default pages drives collective investor behavior. "By far the most commonly used investment data website is Yahoo Finance," Wurgler noted. "So depending on what is served to you on Yahoo Finance, that's served to pretty much everybody, or at least millions of people." This phenomenon has profound implications for market dynamics. When millions of investors rely on the same information source and default settings, it can amplify certain market trends and create herd-like behavior. The study also confirmed what many market observers have long suspected: retail investors are heavily influenced by news events and brand recognition. Major corporate announcements, like Apple's iPhone launch during the study period, generated massive spikes in investor research activity. This pattern has only intensified with the rise of social media. While Wurgler’s data predates platforms like Reddit and TikTok, the underlying behavior (following salient news and recognizable brands) remains consistent. The 2021 meme stock phenomenon with GameStop and AMC as well as the meteoric rise of Pump Fun demonstrated how social media can amplify these tendencies. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 22: The Gamestop company logo is displayed on a screen as traders work on ... More the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on March 22, 2023 in New York City. Stocks opened slightly low ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s next decision on whether to continue increasing interest rates to tame inflation after the conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Perhaps most concerning is what retail investors don't research: risk statistics, financial fundamentals, and proper diversification metrics. The study found that sophisticated risk measures like beta, cash flow analysis, and balance sheet examination are "almost nonexistent" among individual investor research habits. "Most people come into an investment with a rough assessment of risk based on how much upside they see in some kind of informal way," Wurgler observed. This informal approach to risk assessment can lead to poorly diversified portfolios and unexpected losses. The growing influence of retail trading has forced institutional investors to adapt their strategies. Professional money managers now must consider not just fundamental analysis but also what might capture retail investor attention. This dynamic echoes John Maynard Keynes' famous observation about markets being a beauty contest where participants try to predict what others will find attractive. Today's version involves predicting what will trend on financial social media or appear prominently on retail trading platforms. The evolution of retail investor behavior is perhaps most evident in how they respond to market volatility. During the March 2020 crash, individual investors largely sold off their positions, showing a 75% correlation between their flows and negative market performance. Today's retail investors display the opposite behavior. The April 2024 market selloff, triggered by sweeping tariff announcements, saw retail investors split their record $4.7 billion in purchases almost evenly between individual stocks ($2.3 billion) and ETFs ($2.4 billion). Nvidia alone attracted $913 million in net buying, while S&P 500-tracking ETFs received $900 million in inflows. This shift suggests retail investors have grown more confident in their ability to time market bottoms, despite spending minimal time on research. The combination of quick decision-making and aggressive dip-buying creates a powerful force that can amplify both market recoveries and potential losses. The surge in retail trading represents both opportunity and challenge for market efficiency. On one hand, increased participation democratizes investing and provides more capital to growing companies. On the other hand, the research suggests many retail investors may lack the tools and knowledge for effective investment decision-making. The question for regulators and platform providers is whether to nudge investors toward more comprehensive research or accept that quick, intuitive decisions are simply part of modern market behavior. Wurgler’s ongoing research aims to determine whether more research actually leads to better investment outcomes. The preliminary indication suggests the relationship may be flat or even negative, potentially because investors who research more also trade more frequently, a pattern associated with underperformance. As retail trading continues to grow, understanding these behavioral patterns becomes crucial for market stability and investor protection. The six-minute research window may be brief, but its collective impact on markets is anything but small. The rise of retail trading represents a fundamental shift in market dynamics, one where traditional fundamental analysis competes with social media trends and brand recognition for investor attention. For better or worse, the six-minute investor is here to stay.

Title: The New Safe Haven: How High-Net-Worth Investors Are Rethinking Liquidity In 2025

In times of stress, wealth always chases after safety, but in 2025, the definition of “safe” has become much murkier. The investment landscape for high-net-worth (HNW) investors is undergoing a significant transformation, and the definition of safe assets is being re-evaluated. In a world marked by geopolitical instability and unpredictable market responses, liquidity is increasingly viewed as a measure of control, autonomy and psychological reassurance. Investors are quietly rewriting their liquidity playbooks, showcasing a shift in wealth psychology. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. U.S. Treasuries have long been the go-to choice during times of crisis. However, given recent events, even this asset class is being tested, and the long-standing fortress is showing some cracks. Once considered a safe corner of the market, it has become a battleground for hedge funds engaged in “basis trading”—speculative bets on price gaps between Treasuries and their futures. These trades depend heavily on repo funding, which can dry up suddenly in market stress. When that happens, funds can be forced to unwind positions en masse, potentially triggering liquidity spirals. This played out in March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a global dash for cash and repo markets abruptly tightened, forcing hedge funds to unwind their positions. This led to increased volatility and liquidity strains in the Treasury market. To try to stabilize, the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented emergency measures, including large-scale purchases of Treasury securities. Today’s market faces similar worries. The issue isn’t just volatility—it’s structural fragility and the interconnectedness of financial institutions, which can result in systemic risks, especially during sudden liquidity withdrawal. The Fed is concerned about the web of dependencies connecting hedge funds, clearinghouses and banks via the Treasury repo market. Still, Treasuries aren’t dead, and it’s too early to write them off. Short-duration T-bills, in particular, remain a preferred instrument among risk-aware investors because they strike the combination of traits that many HNWIs crave: relatively low risk, reasonable yield and—most importantly—liquidity. In a world where things can go sideways overnight, the ability to exit positions swiftly and without disruption is valued more than incremental returns. If T-bills represent cautious optimism, Bitcoin is starting to reflect something else: digital autonomy. Cryptocurrencies are no longer a niche domain for risk-happy technophiles. Bitcoin is finding its way into the portfolios of younger HNW investors who view it less as a speculative instrument and more as a tool of financial independence. In an era of bank bail-ins, frozen accounts and political uncertainty, Bitcoin offers psychological insurance—a way to preserve access to one’s funds independently of centralized banking systems. For many, it represents a safety net in a world where financial infrastructure feels increasingly fragile. Moreover, the credibility of cryptocurrencies as an asset class has grown considerably in recent times. Bitcoin is now held in ETFs and on major custodial platforms like BlackRock and Fidelity, reinforcing its legitimacy as an institutionally accepted asset. Notable regulatory milestones such as MiCA in the EU and ETF approvals in the U.S. are reframing crypto as a “compliant asset.” This is a big boost to their appeal among conservative HNWIs. Crypto as a whole still remains a volatile asset class. But, in a way, that volatility is understood and accepted these days. Bitcoin’s appeal persists because what rattles people more is not volatility but the lack of access. Being unable to move one’s money in a moment of stress is the greatest fear that transcends crypto and touches every asset class right now. In that regard, cryptocurrencies offer an increasingly popular alternative option. That said, most institutional capital continues to flow into Bitcoin—and to a lesser degree, Ethereum. But not the broader crypto ecosystem. The narrative of legitimacy appears to be mostly confined to these two assets for now. Gold has also re-entered the spotlight, but not for the usual reasons—this time, the focus is not on inflation fears and the metal’s traditional role as a hedge. Gold’s demand today is driven by the desire to de-dollarize and mitigate geopolitical exposure. Central banks around the world are increasing their reserves, seeking insulation from financial shocks and growing geopolitical tensions. Many countries now view gold as a neutral reserve asset that can be used to insulate their economies from U.S. monetary policy and reduce reliance on the dollar in international transactions. High-net-worth investors are also taking note of this trend, choosing gold as a store of value not just to diversify, but to reduce exposure to global fiat-driven volatility. Gold offers something that other assets cannot: a tangible, non-digital store of value that operates outside the influence of any single currency or government. Unlike Bitcoin, you can’t email it to yourself across borders, but in terms of psychological safety, it still holds a unique place. In an increasingly digitized and interconnected world, gold reminds people that some wealth should be physically untouchable to feel permanent and reliable. It’s as much about emotional security as it is about portfolio strategy. What all of these asset shifts have in common is a growing recognition that liquidity is not just a technical metric, it is also an emotional comfort zone. Investors no longer ask, “Can I sell this?” They ask, “Can I get out if things go bad, before everyone else?” How quickly and predictably they can do so when market conditions deteriorate is a key factor up for consideration these days. Recent events have demonstrated just how quickly liquidity can vanish. From the UK’s LDI pension crisis to Silicon Valley Bank’s overnight implosion, the lesson is clear: in a digital, interconnected world, liquidity crunches arrive with little to no warning. Not because of poor asset selection, but because too many people hit the “sell” button at the same time, and the markets just can’t handle it. This results in a new set of investor priorities. Access, execution flexibility and operational resilience now rank alongside—or above—yield and long-term appreciation in wealth management discussions. So what does this mean for advisors, private banks and family offices? It means that traditional approaches to portfolio construction are no longer sufficient. Today’s clients are asking deeper questions about asset behavior under stress, and they expect precise, actionable answers. In response to this changing mindset, asset managers should keep several strategies in mind. First: segmentation matters. Advisors need to start viewing portfolios not just in terms of risk and reward, but also in terms of exit timelines. What can be liquidated in a day? A week? A quarter? Segment portfolios by liquidity tiers to offer greater clarity and control. That’s how investors are learning to think now. Second: diversify not just across assets, but across liquidity types. Investment-grade corporate bonds might carry more credit risk than Treasuries, for example, but they offer alternatives for those seeking yield without locking up capital long-term. Third: embrace transparency and offer real-time monitoring tools. Dashboards that show bid-ask spreads, margin call thresholds and funding market stress aren’t just for CIOs anymore—clients want to be able to see them too. In 2025, liquidity is no longer just a technical detail. It’s a board-level issue. It influences asset selection, client satisfaction and, ultimately, institutional resilience. The biggest takeaway? Liquidity must be built before it’s needed. In volatile periods, buffers are tested, often brutally and with no warning, so make sure to construct them while there’s relative calm. Stress test everything, and remember: the true mark of safety isn’t an asset’s label or historical reputation—it’s how it behaves when the music stops. Investors and institutions must take the initiative to prepare for liquidity shocks, because when the stress hits, the window to act is often measured in minutes, not days.

Hello, and welcome to your weekly dose of Big Tech news and insights. I'm your host, Alistair Barr. My dog Maisie came through her surgery. That cost thousands of dollars. How much would you pay to keep your furry friend alive? In 2013, my old boss Brad Stone published "The Everything Store." It's the defining book about Amazon's giant e-commerce business. The key idea in the book was infinite product selection. This strategy propelled the company to become the Western world's largest retailer. Based on quarterly sales, it overtook Walmart earlier this year. Having endless inventory means shoppers are more likely to find what they're looking for on Amazon, increasing the chances they buy something, and return again. That's been a powerful advantage over physical retail stores, which can only stock so much. However, in recent years, some of Amazon's digital aisles have become cluttered and outdated, which could confuse or frustrate shoppers. So, under CEO Andy Jassy, the company has been purging billions of product listings via a secret project known as "Bend the Curve." Business Insider's star tech reporter Eugene Kim has the scoop with all the juicy details. Does this spell the end of The Everything Store? Nope. There's no way Amazon would give up this hard-won advantage. Instead, it's mostly about cleaning up this giant online marketplace. Product listings get old. Sellers can chuck thousands of listings on there, and some are inaccurate or worse. There are also millions of dollars in cloud savings from not having to host billions of unproductive listings. Still, this big move has been debated inside Amazon, according to Kim's report. And surveys by Evercore ISI found that fewer shoppers think Amazon's product selection is the best. READ MORE Other BI tech stories that caught my eye lately: My take on who's up and down in the tech industry right now, including updates on Big Tech employee pay. UP: Tesla surged this week after Elon Musk said he's getting back to work. DOWN: In late February, investor Ross Gerber predicted a 50% drop in Tesla's share price. The stock is up roughly 20% since then. Ouch! COMP UPDATE: Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald looked at restricted stock units issued recently by tech companies including Meta, Google, and Uber. RSUs are the main way tech employees get paid. The latest numbers show these equity awards are slowing down or even falling at some companies. The chart below shows changes in RSU grant value per employee. Other Big Tech stories I found on the interwebs: This week, I'm telling you about an AI tool that may not be immediately obvious as AI. But it most certainly is. Tesla uses thousands of chips in massive data centers to train AI models that understand video collected from millions of the company's vehicles. This is used to develop FSD software for near-autonomous driving. I've been using FSD a lot this year in my Tesla Model 3 Performance. Here are the highs and lows. Is this a fair assessment? Tesla plans to roll out a full robotaxi service in Austin in June. This will be fully autonomous, with no human supervision. It's a huge leap.

Title: Refused Debate Festival Boycott in Supporting Palestine
URL: https://loudwire.com/refused-debate-effectiveness-festival-boycott-support-palestine/
Time Published: 2025-05-30T18:40:14Z
Full Content:
Refused admittedly considered boycotting some upcoming festival appearances after learning that one of the financial backers had invested in Israeli Cyber Security amidst the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. But rather than doing so, they detailed some of the thought provoking conversations that took place in deciding how to approach what to do in trying to share their support for Palestine amidst reports from Al Jazeera of starving citizens due to Israel's blockade from aid. The veteran rockers announced that they would be embarking on a farewell tour this year and that includes a number of appearances at music festivals around the world. The band revealed their initial gut reaction to drop off an unnamed festival after learning that the event had a financial investor that didn't align with their political view and had.dealings in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict. But, when reaching out to the festival to share their concerns, they were confronted with discussion of some of the problematic players that have a hand in other parts of their business. That led to a multi-layered discussion about how to proceed, the effectiveness of the band boycotting the festival and what the band could actually do to best show their support for the starving Palestinians that inspired their reaction. As stated, rather than immediately acting on the impulse to boycott select festivals they were playing that had a perceived problematic financial backer, Refused reached out to festival organizers that led to a larger discussion on how to best address their concerns. The band shared a detailed account on social media about some of the discussions that were had, which can be read below: So a week ago we found out that some of the festival we're playing this summer are backed by an entertainment conglomerate called Superstruct in which a bad bad actor named KKR is part owner. KKR invests in Israeli Cyber Security among other fucked up things. Our first instinct was to immediately jump ship, to boycott. We communicated this to the festivals and the organizers wrote back saying they shared our values and felt like we did, that they loved what they did and were proud of the festivals they'd created, that the majority of their audience would be sympathetic to our position and that they were gutted that bastards like KKR had bought into Superstruct after they'd started working with them, staining their life's work by extension. One of them also questioned our other associations (cheeky, but he was right), saying that Live Nation are behind some other festivals and shows we're playing, one of whose owners are Blackrock, a multinational heavily invested in weapons manufacturing, and that our music is on Spotify which donated money to Donald Trump's inauguration and also invests in military AI. The scum of the earth basically. These festivals also told us they wanted us to make noise for the Palestinian cause, one of them even offered to give us a large amount of money just to donate to pro-Palestinian organizations. So, the conundrum became: Boycotting these festivals would make us feel good about ourselves, the band's legacy wouldn't been tarnished by association with these disgusting companies. It would feel nice, but it wouldn't do any good; Being morally superior doesn't put food in the mouths of starving Palestinians. Also it wouldn't make headlines; We're not top billing on these festivals because, although we have a strong following within a specific subgenre of heavy music, we're not a huge band. Some Swedish leftists sitting out a few festivals wouldn't raise many eyebrows. We've mulled this over and although there's a strong argument for taking a stand against KKR and this development of amoral private equeity and hedge funds buying into the arts because it's non-controversial and comparatively safe, it would be naive to think our boycott would even register for them. Rather the opposite, if people like that knew what we talked about on stage they would rather have us stay home, and with the charred bodies of Palestinians burned alive stacking up in the concentration camp/graveyard that Gaza has become, we have decided to make some noise, to go meet our people, to celebrate the resistance and raise money for the Palestinian cause this summer. To us, it it the right thing to do, to get out there and be a thorn in the side of zionists, fascists, venture capitalists and to fan the flames of discontent together with our bright, informed comrades all over Europe. A lot of you have already bought tickets and are expecting us, so we'd love to get suggestions from local organizations and activists we could work with in all the countries and cities we're playing. FREE PALESTINE!!! The band continued their discussion in the comments section of their post. "These kinds of deliberations are not new to us. In our late teens, coming out of the DIY underground, we were obsessed with ending our involvement in systemic oppression through the power of boycott, through spreading awareness of the human rights abuses in the countries that produced the consumer objects our generation coveted, the environmental impact of eating meat, the horrific abuses carried out by the USA in South America in order for us to have cheap bananas," they shared. "These were all hot topics in the leftist punk underground at the time (and if we're being self-critical for a moment, it's obvious now that we were deluded in thinking that creating leftist utopias outside of the mainstream would achieve the great system change we were aiming for. Instead we left the parliaments to the neo-nazis we used to fight in the streets [Antifa did the lion's share of the fighting, but once or twice we fought them as a band, though most of the time we were too outnumbered and out-menaced to do shit], who gladly put on suits and toned their rhetoric down in order to gain power, an endeavor in which they succeeded beyond our wildest nightmares, as we can see all over the west right now)," Refused added. They continued, "It took us uneducated working class morons a while to learn what many picked up during two or three classes at uni: that all of us in the west are complicit in the exploitation and subjugation of a huge part of the non-western world and while we worked hard to rid ourselves of this complicity by becoming incredibly conscious consumers, we slowly started to understand the immense machine of oppression that Europe and the US have constituted from the 1500s to this day, a fact that made our twenty-something consumer choices in the north of Sweden seem pretty insignificant." From there the group offered, "This didn't deter us, but it definitely put us in check. What we quickly realized though was that we were always gonna be a gateway band. The underground community is a beautiful place, but after having seen the hundredth band preaching about the evils of capitalism or organized religion to a crowd of people dressed exactly the same as them, reading the same books, listening to the same bands, you start to wonder what the point really is: do we want to be right or do we want change? Refused was always a different animal than the pure, DIY or die-bands, and we did things they could not. That was kind of the point, to try and bring these ideas into the light." READ MORE: Bands Who Broke Up + Ones Who Reunited in 2024 "The centre-right government of Sweden gave us an award once (thank you @psl) and although we fucking hated their guts, we accepted the award just so we could stand right there in the corridors of power and ridicule them, humiliate them to their faces," they recalled. "There were minor deals with minor devils made, but through it all, we reached kids who would never have been exposed to these ideas otherwise: we turned a lot of people on to vegetarianism and veganism through our music, and there's no counting the amount of people who have come up to us and said that our songs sowed the first seed of what grew to be a radical political life. It's what we're most proud of, the many activists, teachers, human rights lawyers, doctors and environmentalists for whom we were a companion (or even a stepping stone) on the way to a life of serving the greater good. They didn't preach to the converted, they didn't freak out about bar codes on CDs, they actually went out there and did shit," continued the band. In conclusion, they stated, "I guess what we're trying to say is, these choices are not easy for us but we take them very seriously, and we've driven ourselves mad trying to bat a hundred in a crooked game. Which is why our next project will be DIY, more on that later." As stated, Refused are in the midst of their farewell tour. The band kicked off a North American run earlier this spring. They'll start up their next tour leg on June 13 at the Nova Rock festival in Nickelsdorf, Austria with European dates booked through Aug. 22 in Vilar De Mouros, Portugal. More dates in the U.K. and Europe will follow in October with the band currently booked through Oct. 12 in Munchen, Germany.

Title: The ultimate ecommerce website launch checklist

Time Published: 2025-05-30T18:15:38Z
Full Content:
The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog May 30, 2025 Launching a high-performing ecommerce site requires precision, collaboration, and attention to detail — especially for established businesses managing complex operations. So how do you know when you’re ready for your ecommerce website launch? You make a checklist. Whether you’re expanding into new markets, replatforming for scalability, or even starting your online business, a structured launch process minimizes risk and ensures your shop is optimized from day one. This comprehensive ecommerce website launch checklist will keep you from getting that, “What did I forget?” feeling. Let’s get into the list. The very first thing on your ecommerce launch checklist should be making sure you’re using the best ecommerce platform. Proprietary ecommerce platforms spend a lot of money to attract and persuade decision makers, but that doesn’t mean they’re the best option. What is a proprietary platform? It’s one where the company that develops and manages the platform controls the code. It requires you to host your site with their hosting services, and if you accidentally violate one of their terms of service, they can permanently remove your store from their platform without giving you a reason why. Before committing to any platform, read their terms of service closely. Some require that you grant them royalty-free, non-exclusive, unrestricted license to everything you upload to their service (including using those materials to train their AI systems). Proprietary ecommerce platforms include Shopify, Wix, and BigCommerce (and there are others). When you sign up with one of these companies, your organizations become subject to many more restrictions than if you build your ecommerce business around an open source solution. If you like all of the bureaucracy and red tape that come with big companies, you’ll love these proprietary platforms. But if you’re planning to create an ecommerce store that you can retain maximum control over and that can affordably grow with your business over time, an open source ecommerce platform like WooCommerce (which powers over 43% of all ecommerce websites) is the better choice. Open source solutions don’t have software-specific restrictions on your products or content, they offer you the freedom to be able to extend and customize your ecommerce store more easily, and don’t require that you sign a contract granting them use of your intellectual property. More importantly, an open-source platform allows you to pick and choose the services and tools you invest in without forcing you to sign up for a plan and pay for more than you need. We’ve got a more in-depth article about why you should choose an open source ecommerce platform, if you want to dive deeper on that topic. But regardless of the solution you choose, make sure that it aligns with your capabilities, business model, marketing plan, goals, and values. Your choice of web host can significantly impact your store’s performance, user experience, and ultimately, your ecommerce success. If you’ve chosen a proprietary ecommerce platform — like a Shopify store — that takes care of hosting for you, your only option for improving your hosting quality will be to upgrade your subscription tier. However, if you’re using WordPress with an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce, you can select any web hosting provider that suits your needs. There are a lot of different types of web hosting out there — shared hosting, VPS, cloud hosting, managed hosting, etc. — so if you’re not sure which type of hosting to choose, read our detailed guide to choosing the right WooCommerce web host. Our TL;DR of hosting: Why not choose a host that’s built for WooCommerce, allowing for easy scalability and dedicated support? At Automattic, Woo’s parent company, we have three hosting providers: Regardless of the exact hosting type you decide on, make sure your ecommerce website is hosted with a provider that can accommodate your store’s needs today and into the future. Make sure you can answer the following questions: Estimate the amount of traffic you expect. A new online business might not need the same resources as an established one with thousands of daily visitors. But even a site with fewer visitors may need robust server resources due to intensive software and processes that are triggered by visitor activity on the site (e.g. forums or online courses). It’s always better to overestimate than underestimate your resource needs and ensure that your host can handle peak traffic and user activity expectations. Your hosting needs will grow as your business expands. Choose a host that can easily scale with your ecommerce store. Some hosts offer autoscaling for occasional surges in site traffic. Autoscaling provides increased bandwidth so that a spike in visitors due to a viral social media post, flash sale, or hacking attempt doesn’t bring down your site. Some hosts offer managed WordPress hosting that’s optimized especially for ecommerce platforms like WooCommerce. If you’re building a WooCommerce store, you may want to consider a host that has a good deal of experience hosting WooCommerce sites. Fast load times are crucial for ecommerce stores. Look for hosts that use SSD storage, content delivery networks (CDNs), server-side caching, and other performance optimizations. Keep in mind that shared hosting can be slower than VPS or dedicated servers because you share the server with other websites. This might not be an issue for a small to medium-sized store, but growing ecommerce websites will benefit from the additional resources that VPS and dedicated hosting can provide. Downtime can lead to lost sales, and hosting companies know this. That’s why the industry standard in uptime is 99.99%. If your host does not offer an uptime guarantee or have a track record of performing at, near, or above that 99.9% standard — steer clear. The only thing better than 99.99%? Pressable offers WordPress-specific hosting with a 100% uptime guarantee. Online stores handle sensitive customer data and all stores should be compliant with rules set by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Look for a host that is a PCI DSS Level 1 service provider and provides security features like SSL certificates, firewalls, and DDoS protection. Reliable support is essential, even if you’re a technical expert. Some website issues can only be handled by your host’s support staff (like server outages and account issues) and if those issues are causing downtime on your site, it can dramatically affect your ecommerce business or your agency’s reputation. Look for hosts that offer 24/7 customer support via multiple channels. A user-friendly control panel can make managing your site much easier. Many hosts offer cPanel or Plesk for managing your site’s files and database. If you choose a managed WordPress hosting plan, your host will have their own custom-built admin interface that you will use to manage your website. Regular backups are an absolute must to protect your site against data loss if someone hacks it or you accidentally delete important content. Make sure your host provides automatic backups and an easy method of restoring those backups to your live site. However, relying on your host alone leaves a massive gap in your security and recovery options. You also need your own real-time, off-site backup system so you can always get back online right away — even if your site is completely down or the problem stems from your host. Consider Jetpack VaultPress Backup for a best-in-class solution. When prospective customers visit your online store, you want your web pages to make a statement. Your store should get their attention, demonstrate professionalism, and show that your products are top-notch. Here are a few important ecommerce web design considerations: Which online store would you rather shop at? One with a domain name of best-dog-clothes-2.angelfire.lycos.com or one called woofandwiggle.com? We’re betting it’s the second choice. Long, non-branded urls feel inherently untrustworthy. They can also cause brand confusion. Can you really be sure you’re on the right website when the domain name doesn’t match the name of the company? An important part of branding is making sure your customers know it’s you, and not an imposter or phishing scheme, when they visit your site. Struggling to come up with the right custom domain name? Check out our article on how to choose a domain name for some guidance. A consistent brand helps potential customers know they’re in the right place. Look through every page of your website for consistent logo usage, fonts, colors, image aesthetics, and layout styles. Make sure you check hover colors and effects for links and buttons to make sure they align with your branding. You should also ensure that the display of any blocks, pages, or elements that may be managed by other extensions match your brand identity, as those sometimes come with their own default styles. Online shopping doesn’t allow customers to feel, touch, or see your products in person. Make sure that you showcase your products from all angles and take close-ups of any unique product details. Even thoughtfully-designed product pages can be quickly devalued by poor photos and video content. Your images and videos should be high-quality, with good lighting, and provide accurate representations of color. User-generated images and videos on your product pages can also be a great way to build brand trust. These don’t have to be as high quality — they just need to be informative, from verified customers, and if they are funny or feature dogs, cats, or a banana for scale, even better! Many devices have retina display screens, which have a higher density of pixels and make content look crisper. If you’re serving up lower resolution images, they may look fuzzy on a 4k monitor or a smartphone. To make sure your images are optimized for display on higher-resolution devices, you can add a retina version that’s exactly two times the size of the original. Many themes include a way to do this or you can use a plugin like Perfect Images. Not only should your images look good across desktop and mobile devices, it should also use a responsive layout that can automatically adjust to the type of device the site is being displayed on. For example, horizontal navigation menus on a desktop display should collapse to a small hamburger-style menu on mobile. Columns of content distributed horizontally across the screen on a laptop should collapse into a vertical stack on an iPhone or Android device. To make launching your site faster and easier, WooCommerce has some great responsive themes available in the WooCommerce Themes library. Emotional connection is extremely valuable in reaching new fans as well as encouraging brand loyalty. And what better way to connect with others than through storytelling? Your brand story is the launchpad for your store’s voice — your writing style, how you connect with customers, and how you portray your business in marketing campaigns all derive from your brand story. By telling visitors about yourself and how your business came to be, what your values are, and where your passions lie, you’ll create a personal and meaningful conversation with your customers around your brand. Add your full brand story to your About page and sprinkle highlights and excerpts of it (e.g. “Building sustainable play equipment since 1977”) on other prominent areas of your website like your homepage, product pages, and even purchase receipts. If you don’t grab your potential customers’ attention in the first few seconds, they’ll leave — 55% of people spend less than 15 seconds on a website. Once you have their attention, the next most important thing is to encourage customers to click through to where you ultimately want them to go. There should be multiple ways for your site visitors to find the product they’re looking for or the solution to their problem. If you only have a few products, feature them prominently on the homepage and use appealing calls to action above the fold (the area that you first see upon page load) so that customers don’t even have to open the navigation menu to search. For more involved ecommerce sites with a large variety of products, make sure that your navigation menu is organized intuitively and that your products are categorized in a way that makes sense. Use mega menus with image thumbnails to highlight specific products and popular product categories. Often, customers just want to find your site search feature and type in the name of or type of product they are looking for. Test your search functionality using product names as well as less specific keywords such as “black striped sundress.” Not satisfied with the search results? Check out extensions like Jetpack Search to add to the experience. Make sure that, on your shop and category pages, customers can easily tell your products apart, understand what each one is, and know how to find out more information. Create filters based on price, color, brand, etc. that will help your customers narrow down your product list. Include category descriptions on your category pages so shoppers know they are in the right place. Review your product pages and make sure each product description is compelling, contains important information like size charts, color variations, material content, etc. and is free from grammatical and spelling errors. Additional product details you might want to add include whether or not the product ships separately, is eligible for a discount, is a limited edition, requires specific care or storage, or requires a minimum order quantity (MOQ). If you don’t ask your customers to purchase, why would they? Use button colors that pop on the page and choose actionable language — “Buy Now,” “Shop Tees,” or “Find the Right Size.” The last thing you want is for an interested customer to leave because they can’t figure out how to check out. Make sure there is a cart icon in the top right corner of your menu that, when expanded, includes a link to the Checkout page. Then, no matter where a customer is on your site, they can make a purchase in just a few clicks. Don’t lose high-intent customers: 50% of U.S. consumers will abandon their cart if checkout takes longer than 30 seconds. So, making the purchasing process quick and easy is crucial to getting sales. You can optimize your checkout by: Are the business address, email address, and phone number easy to find? It’s a standard expectation that you have a contact page with multiple ways for your customers to get in touch. But it can also be helpful to put your customer support information in your site’s footer or offer chat bot support to help customers get connected with you quickly. When a customer logs in, you want them to be able to easily access important information like their order history, billing information, available downloads, and order tracking numbers. Review your customer account dashboard page and make sure that it contains what your customers are looking for. A favicon is the icon that appears in the browser address bar and bookmark list. A recognizable favicon makes it easy for your customers to find you again after they’ve navigated away to another tab. When a customer has your ecommerce website open on one tab and 32 other tabs of cat videos at the same time, you want to make it easy for them to get back to your store. Next on the checklist is making sure crucial functionality on your ecommerce website is working correctly. It doesn’t really matter if your ecommerce site looks beautiful and is easy to navigate if it doesn’t actually work! Check every link on all pages, products, headers, and footers and ensure that they are working. This is not only important from a functionality standpoint, but it’s important for SEO, too. If you have a large number of pages or have migrated your store over from a different ecommerce platform, you might want to run a scan using Broken Link Checker to find and update or redirect all your broken links. Make sure to disable and delete the plugin when you’re done, as it can be a drag on performance. Don’t forget to check your link behavior, too. Most internal links you’ll want to open in the same tab, but if you’re linking to external sites, you’ll want them to open in a new tab so your visitors aren’t transported away from your site completely. You may have other specialty extensions installed, like Product Add-Ons or Mix and Match Products. You’ll want to double check that all your extensions are working together without issue. Most extensions will also have a list of known compatibility issues in their documentation, so you should review that information before you purchase and install any particular extension. These are effective methods of increasing average order value, so you want to make sure they’re set up correctly. You can do this on each individual product page by going to Product Data → Linked Products. View a more thorough tutorial here. Go through your checkout process in its entirety, from adding a product to your shopping cart, applying a discount code, choosing a shipping location, and making a payment. Check each of your payment methods if you have more than one. Also try checking out and putting incorrect information in — the CVV on your credit card, for example. Does the correct message appear? Make sure an appropriate error message appears so the customer knows what the issue is. After a purchase, what happens? Do you get a notification that an order was placed? Does the customer get an order confirmation? Make sure all of these processes are in place and work with a transactional email service provider to help guarantee email delivery. If you want visual customization of emails along with advanced email and SMS marketing capabilities, check out Klaviyo. You’ve made sure emails are being sent and received, you’ve confirmed checkout is working, but you may have other forms on your site like email signup forms, contact page forms, or event registration forms. Make sure that your customer is able to submit information and receives a confirmation page or email and that you received the form submission. If you’ve migrated from another ecommerce platform, make sure that customers can log in and view existing tracking information, order history, and subscriptions, if applicable. You’ll also want to back up all of your orders from your previous ecommerce site. What happens if someone goes to a bad link or types in an incorrect URL? A 404 page is a great way to guide people to what they’re looking for — make the most of it! Include links to important pages and a search box and you may be able to turn a mistake into a sale. First and foremost, you should make sure that usernames and passwords work for your ecommerce store admins, shop managers, and customers. Next, check to see that your users are all assigned the correct role and access permissions. In addition to the default WordPress admin, editor, and subscriber roles, WooCommerce has a built-in shop management user role and customer user role. You may want to assign more granular permissions to certain staff users with an extension like User Roles Editor, or gate access to specific content or products based on membership status with WooCommerce Memberships. If your customers have to wait for your website to load, they’ll go somewhere else. In fact, 53% of consumers will leave a website if it takes longer than three seconds to load. So if your website is taking longer than three seconds to load, check to see what’s slowing your site down and fix those issues before you launch. Below are just a few steps you can take to optimize your site’s load time, but if you want a more comprehensive guide, you can check out this article explaining steps you can take to speed up your WooCommerce site. Serve compressed images that are sized appropriately for the device that they’ll be viewed on. We’ve created a detailed guide on optimizing your images so they load quickly that may be helpful if you’re not sure how to go about it. Caching is a process that temporarily stores copies of data in a location that allows for quicker access compared to retrieving it from its original source. Basically, it speeds up load time. Your host may implement server-side caching, but you can also use extensions like Jetpack or WP Super Cache to help your site load faster. Go through your WordPress backend and delete unused themes, plugins, pages, media files, and posts. Not only can they add more load to your server, slowing down your site, things like unused themes and plugins can be vulnerable to hackers. Plus, outdated content on pages and posts may confuse customers if their content shows up on search engine results pages. As a store owner, you want satisfied customers that have a great user experience on your site and enjoy the products that you sell, but all the happy shoppers in the world won’t make a difference if you don’t have your financial side set up correctly. Poorly thought-out pricing, failing to set up sales tax properly, and misconfigured payment options can all lead to disastrous results. No ecommerce checklist would be complete without asking the following financial questions: At the very minimum, you should price your products so that the retail price covers your cost of goods (COGs) and includes a certain percentage of profit. But profit margins can vary widely across industries and if your products are niche or luxury goods, markups can be significantly higher than more ubiquitous products. Make sure you’ve done some research on pricing for products similar to yours. Don’t be afraid to start off by skewing higher — you can always bring your prices down, but once shoppers get used to lower prices it can be difficult to raise them drastically and retain customers. Taxes are an important element of ecommerce businesses and you want to make sure they’re set up correctly. You can find your tax settings by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Tax. You’ll find several options there to fit your situation or you can also install the WooCommerce Tax extension to help you automatically configure sales tax. For a more in-depth guide, you can read our article about how to set up sales tax on your WooCommerce website. Regardless of how you choose to manage sales tax on your site, we do recommend consulting with an accountant or tax professional to ensure you’re taking the right steps. Check your payment gateway settings in WooCommerce → Settings → Payments and make sure they’re enabled and connected to your store. Review your accepted payment methods to make sure you’ve enabled the right ones for your store. In your payment gateway account, itself, you’ll want to ensure that your business’ bank account is connected to your payment gateway account. If your online store sells to multiple countries, you’ll want to provide customers the ability to view products in their local currency. Make sure that the currency conversions are accurate for products, shipping, taxes, and any checkout add-ons. You are launching an online store, after all, so you want to make sure you have the correct inventory count, a way to manage and track that inventory, and that your shipping methods are set up and priced correctly. Here are a few inventory and shipping-related things you should tick off your launch checklist before you go live: Go through each of your products and make sure that the inventory levels are up-to-date and correct. You can edit your inventory settings by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Products → Inventory and update stock quantities on each individual product page. WooCommerce also offers a variety of extensions that help you sync inventory with your warehouse, Amazon store, eBay store, or other platform. If you have variable products, try switching variations and make sure that prices, variation descriptions, and featured images change appropriately. Whether your shipping calculations are weight-based, product-based, or cart-based, try different combinations to make sure the numbers come out correctly. Check all of the shipping methods that you have available and try different shipping locations. You’ll also want to make sure that any shipping labels you have set up are working. It’s important for your customers to know whether or not you accept returns and what the terms are. Outline how long customers have to make a return, the required condition of the product, how refunds will be received, and who will pay for shipping. If you sell digital products on your ecommerce site, make sure that the right files are uploaded and delivered successfully after purchase. Go to WooCommerce → Settings → Products → Downloadable Products to view options for file delivery. Once your store is live, you need a way to drive potential customers to it. And once you have customers, you need to keep them engaged and coming back. On top of that, you need a way to check that your marketing plan is working. Here are a few marketing considerations to check off your ecommerce launch checklist before you share your site with the world. If someone abandons their cart, do you have a way to follow up with them? It’s rare for a customer to make a purchase the first time they visit your site, so make sure you have the measures in place to reach back out. Extensions like AutomateWoo or your own email marketing software can help with this. No marketing plan is complete without an email marketing strategy. In fact, email marketing drives more and more global revenue each year. Make sure you’re using an email marketing platform like Klaviyo or MailPoet to send special offers, news updates, blog posts, and other useful content that can drive sales. Do you know which social media channels you’ll be using to advertise your products? There are a lot of different platforms and not all of them will be the right fit for your business. Don’t spread yourself too thin or focus on a platform where your target customers don’t spend their time. Not sure which platforms you should choose? Check out our guide to choosing the right social media platforms for your store. Once you’ve chosen your platforms, you’ll want to make sure your products and advertisements are set up correctly. If you share a product on Facebook, does the right photo show up? Is your TikTok shop connected to your WooCommerce store? Are your meta titles and descriptions correct? If you need help managing some of this, the Yoast SEO plugin will allow you to edit your products’ appearance on social media. A big part of your marketing plan should be tracking its effectiveness. Google search and display ads as well as social media advertising can all be a huge driver of sales, but you also need to make sure that your ads aren’t costing you more than you’re making with each conversion. Tools like Conversion Tracking Pro for WooCommerce can seamlessly connect your store to your various advertising platforms and help you track analytics all in one place. Content marketing can help your store sell in multiple ways. You can create gift guides that inspire your customers, use blog posts about your business and products that include target keywords to improve SEO, and craft how-to guides and tutorials to help customers better understand how to use your products. Google Analytics not only monitors sales and ad performance, it also tracks a wide variety of user behavior, demographics, and traffic sources. This data can help you better understand who is visiting your site, how long they stay there, the keywords they use in search to find you, what devices they use to access your site, and more. Tools like WooCommerce Advanced Analytics Pro can give you even more advanced insights into important ecommerce metrics like average order value, conversion rate, sales by product or category, and even order refunds and cancellations. All this information can be used to help inform your approach to multiple aspects of your business and marketing strategy, including ecommerce SEO, email marketing, web design, and social media. SEO is a term with a lot of buzz around it, but for good reason. Search Engine Optimization is the art of being found on platforms like Google when people are looking for something you offer. You can spend a lot of time and money on the nuances of every aspect of ecommerce SEO — like keyword research, including the right number of internal links, perfecting your content length, and obsessing over analytics tools — but simply doing the basics right will put you a step ahead of most new ecommerce stores. The meta descriptions for your pages and products are what a customer will see when searching on Google. Make sure that they’re informative and engaging and make someone want to click on your products instead of your competitors’. In addition to your meta descriptions, you might also want to add rich snippets to your web pages. These snippets rely on specific HTML that lets you display things like reviews, product price, product carousels, business hours, and more in search results, helping your site stand out from competitors. Alt text plays a very important role in ecommerce SEO for a couple of reasons. One, it’s a primary way that Google “reads” your images and understands what they display. Two, screen readers read alt text aloud to help those that are visually impaired understand the content. Your alt text should be descriptive of the image and also contain your target keyword in a natural way. While alt text is one aspect of accessibility, there are more considerations. Make sure your font size is large enough to read. Watch out for color combinations like green and red that may make it difficult for someone with color blindness to interpret graphics or text. Add subtitles to product videos so that someone with hearing impairments understands what’s being said. Learn more about why accessibility is so important. The title of your products should be concise and descriptive. Do some keyword research to make sure that you’re formulating product titles that people are searching for. Remember, this is what they’ll see when searching for products on search engines! Your URLs should be concise and definitive. This helps people and search engines understand exactly what your product page is about. For example, it’s much easier to understand what www.example.com/red-dog-leash is about than www.example.com/index.php?id_reddogleash=360&sid=3a5ebc944f41daa6f849f730f1. Also make sure to separate words with dashes instead of underscores. An XML sitemap is essentially a blueprint of your ecommerce website that helps Google understand exactly what pages there are. You can easily generate a sitemap using Yoast SEO or a similar plugin and submit your sitemap to Google using Google Search Console. The last thing you want is for your new website to be hacked and your customers’ information compromised after you launch. That’s why it’s important that you take the right steps to secure your online store! A firewall protects your WordPress website from incoming malicious attacks. Jetpack Security is an excellent option, built by the people behind WordPress.com. Not only does it provide a firewall, but it also offers a comprehensive suite of security tools like real-time backups and downtime monitoring. An SSL certificate encrypts and protects sensitive information, like your customers’ credit card data. Not only is it important from a legal and ethical standpoint, Google also flags websites without an SSL certificate as “insecure.” This can have a negative effect on your visitors’ perception of your brand, or worse — prevent them from accessing your site at all. Use a combination of numbers, symbols, and letters that’s at least eight characters long. You may also want to consider two-factor authentication, which provides additional verification for administrators (like a code sent to your cell phone or authenticator app). This is particularly important if you have post comments or product reviews enabled. It’ll keep your site more secure and save you tons of time filtering through spam. A great solution is Askimet — just set it up and you won’t have to worry about spam again! You should have regular, automatic backups set up for your site files and your database. There are several ways to do this, through your hosting provider or with plugins like Jetpack VaultPress Backup. This tool is particularly valuable for online stores, as it takes backups in real time so you never lose a single sale or piece of customer information. It’s important that you always keep your theme, plugins, and WordPress software up-to-date. Old versions are much easier to hack into. If you’d prefer not to worry about it, just set up auto-updates in your dashboard. Last, but not least on your ecommerce website checklist: double-check (if not quadruple-check!) that you are legally compliant. Having the right legal infrastructure in place protects you from lawsuits and helps your customers understand how you use their data and how your store policies work. You may want to hire a lawyer to make sure you have everything set up to legally run your ecommerce business — it’s well worth the investment! While your lawyer should also be able to help draft your website’s terms and conditions and privacy policies, laws can change and so can the content of your site. Updating your policies regularly can become a bit of a chore. Fortunately there are some online services that allow you to create legally-compliant policies for your ecommerce site that update automatically. Regardless of the route you take to meet your legal obligations, make sure these are easy to find on your ecommerce website. Ask yourself: Terms and conditions lay out the rules of conduct between you and your website visitors that must be followed if they want to purchase your products. To add a checkbox for customers to agree to your terms on your checkout page, navigate to WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced and select a Terms and Conditions page. A good privacy policy explains exactly how you’ll handle customer information and data on your ecommerce website. It establishes credibility and is an important layer of protection for your business. You can add a link to your privacy policy on your Checkout page by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced and selecting a Privacy Policy page. GDPR is a law concerning data handling for European residents. This applies to you if you sell to anyone in the E.U., even if you’re not located there. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with it and adjust policies if needed. You can learn more in our GDPR article hub. The final thing you should do before launch is to have real people test your site. Ask employees, friends, family or, better yet, members of your target audience to use the site and note anything they find difficult or confusing. There’s nothing better than having a fresh set of unbiased eyes going through everything. As the saying goes, “Measure twice, cut once.” It’s better to get as much as possible right before you launch so that expensive mistakes don’t haunt you later on. Want professional support? If you aren’t already working with an agency, check out our vetted Woo agency partners who have been through the launch process many times and can provide guidance to set you up for ecommerce success. About Customize buttons Great, thank you so much for this post! My website is already launched, but I’ve found a lot of useful tips and points to check out on my website. Especially I recommend everyone to pay more attention to the legal side of your business and security stuff because I know that amazing website can attract visitors, but if these points are weak, they won’t turn into your customers.

Title: The ultimate ecommerce website launch checklist
URL: https://woocommerce.com/posts/ecommerce-website-launch-checklit/
Time Published: 2025-05-30T18:15:38Z
Full Content:
The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog May 30, 2025 Launching a high-performing ecommerce site requires precision, collaboration, and attention to detail — especially for established businesses managing complex operations. So how do you know when you’re ready for your ecommerce website launch? You make a checklist. Whether you’re expanding into new markets, replatforming for scalability, or even starting your online business, a structured launch process minimizes risk and ensures your shop is optimized from day one. This comprehensive ecommerce website launch checklist will keep you from getting that, “What did I forget?” feeling. Let’s get into the list. The very first thing on your ecommerce launch checklist should be making sure you’re using the best ecommerce platform. Proprietary ecommerce platforms spend a lot of money to attract and persuade decision makers, but that doesn’t mean they’re the best option. What is a proprietary platform? It’s one where the company that develops and manages the platform controls the code. It requires you to host your site with their hosting services, and if you accidentally violate one of their terms of service, they can permanently remove your store from their platform without giving you a reason why. Before committing to any platform, read their terms of service closely. Some require that you grant them royalty-free, non-exclusive, unrestricted license to everything you upload to their service (including using those materials to train their AI systems). Proprietary ecommerce platforms include Shopify, Wix, and BigCommerce (and there are others). When you sign up with one of these companies, your organizations become subject to many more restrictions than if you build your ecommerce business around an open source solution. If you like all of the bureaucracy and red tape that come with big companies, you’ll love these proprietary platforms. But if you’re planning to create an ecommerce store that you can retain maximum control over and that can affordably grow with your business over time, an open source ecommerce platform like WooCommerce (which powers over 43% of all ecommerce websites) is the better choice. Open source solutions don’t have software-specific restrictions on your products or content, they offer you the freedom to be able to extend and customize your ecommerce store more easily, and don’t require that you sign a contract granting them use of your intellectual property. More importantly, an open-source platform allows you to pick and choose the services and tools you invest in without forcing you to sign up for a plan and pay for more than you need. We’ve got a more in-depth article about why you should choose an open source ecommerce platform, if you want to dive deeper on that topic. But regardless of the solution you choose, make sure that it aligns with your capabilities, business model, marketing plan, goals, and values. Your choice of web host can significantly impact your store’s performance, user experience, and ultimately, your ecommerce success. If you’ve chosen a proprietary ecommerce platform — like a Shopify store — that takes care of hosting for you, your only option for improving your hosting quality will be to upgrade your subscription tier. However, if you’re using WordPress with an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce, you can select any web hosting provider that suits your needs. There are a lot of different types of web hosting out there — shared hosting, VPS, cloud hosting, managed hosting, etc. — so if you’re not sure which type of hosting to choose, read our detailed guide to choosing the right WooCommerce web host. Our TL;DR of hosting: Why not choose a host that’s built for WooCommerce, allowing for easy scalability and dedicated support? At Automattic, Woo’s parent company, we have three hosting providers: Regardless of the exact hosting type you decide on, make sure your ecommerce website is hosted with a provider that can accommodate your store’s needs today and into the future. Make sure you can answer the following questions: Estimate the amount of traffic you expect. A new online business might not need the same resources as an established one with thousands of daily visitors. But even a site with fewer visitors may need robust server resources due to intensive software and processes that are triggered by visitor activity on the site (e.g. forums or online courses). It’s always better to overestimate than underestimate your resource needs and ensure that your host can handle peak traffic and user activity expectations. Your hosting needs will grow as your business expands. Choose a host that can easily scale with your ecommerce store. Some hosts offer autoscaling for occasional surges in site traffic. Autoscaling provides increased bandwidth so that a spike in visitors due to a viral social media post, flash sale, or hacking attempt doesn’t bring down your site. Some hosts offer managed WordPress hosting that’s optimized especially for ecommerce platforms like WooCommerce. If you’re building a WooCommerce store, you may want to consider a host that has a good deal of experience hosting WooCommerce sites. Fast load times are crucial for ecommerce stores. Look for hosts that use SSD storage, content delivery networks (CDNs), server-side caching, and other performance optimizations. Keep in mind that shared hosting can be slower than VPS or dedicated servers because you share the server with other websites. This might not be an issue for a small to medium-sized store, but growing ecommerce websites will benefit from the additional resources that VPS and dedicated hosting can provide. Downtime can lead to lost sales, and hosting companies know this. That’s why the industry standard in uptime is 99.99%. If your host does not offer an uptime guarantee or have a track record of performing at, near, or above that 99.9% standard — steer clear. The only thing better than 99.99%? Pressable offers WordPress-specific hosting with a 100% uptime guarantee. Online stores handle sensitive customer data and all stores should be compliant with rules set by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Look for a host that is a PCI DSS Level 1 service provider and provides security features like SSL certificates, firewalls, and DDoS protection. Reliable support is essential, even if you’re a technical expert. Some website issues can only be handled by your host’s support staff (like server outages and account issues) and if those issues are causing downtime on your site, it can dramatically affect your ecommerce business or your agency’s reputation. Look for hosts that offer 24/7 customer support via multiple channels. A user-friendly control panel can make managing your site much easier. Many hosts offer cPanel or Plesk for managing your site’s files and database. If you choose a managed WordPress hosting plan, your host will have their own custom-built admin interface that you will use to manage your website. Regular backups are an absolute must to protect your site against data loss if someone hacks it or you accidentally delete important content. Make sure your host provides automatic backups and an easy method of restoring those backups to your live site. However, relying on your host alone leaves a massive gap in your security and recovery options. You also need your own real-time, off-site backup system so you can always get back online right away — even if your site is completely down or the problem stems from your host. Consider Jetpack VaultPress Backup for a best-in-class solution. When prospective customers visit your online store, you want your web pages to make a statement. Your store should get their attention, demonstrate professionalism, and show that your products are top-notch. Here are a few important ecommerce web design considerations: Which online store would you rather shop at? One with a domain name of best-dog-clothes-2.angelfire.lycos.com or one called woofandwiggle.com? We’re betting it’s the second choice. Long, non-branded urls feel inherently untrustworthy. They can also cause brand confusion. Can you really be sure you’re on the right website when the domain name doesn’t match the name of the company? An important part of branding is making sure your customers know it’s you, and not an imposter or phishing scheme, when they visit your site. Struggling to come up with the right custom domain name? Check out our article on how to choose a domain name for some guidance. A consistent brand helps potential customers know they’re in the right place. Look through every page of your website for consistent logo usage, fonts, colors, image aesthetics, and layout styles. Make sure you check hover colors and effects for links and buttons to make sure they align with your branding. You should also ensure that the display of any blocks, pages, or elements that may be managed by other extensions match your brand identity, as those sometimes come with their own default styles. Online shopping doesn’t allow customers to feel, touch, or see your products in person. Make sure that you showcase your products from all angles and take close-ups of any unique product details. Even thoughtfully-designed product pages can be quickly devalued by poor photos and video content. Your images and videos should be high-quality, with good lighting, and provide accurate representations of color. User-generated images and videos on your product pages can also be a great way to build brand trust. These don’t have to be as high quality — they just need to be informative, from verified customers, and if they are funny or feature dogs, cats, or a banana for scale, even better! Many devices have retina display screens, which have a higher density of pixels and make content look crisper. If you’re serving up lower resolution images, they may look fuzzy on a 4k monitor or a smartphone. To make sure your images are optimized for display on higher-resolution devices, you can add a retina version that’s exactly two times the size of the original. Many themes include a way to do this or you can use a plugin like Perfect Images. Not only should your images look good across desktop and mobile devices, it should also use a responsive layout that can automatically adjust to the type of device the site is being displayed on. For example, horizontal navigation menus on a desktop display should collapse to a small hamburger-style menu on mobile. Columns of content distributed horizontally across the screen on a laptop should collapse into a vertical stack on an iPhone or Android device. To make launching your site faster and easier, WooCommerce has some great responsive themes available in the WooCommerce Themes library. Emotional connection is extremely valuable in reaching new fans as well as encouraging brand loyalty. And what better way to connect with others than through storytelling? Your brand story is the launchpad for your store’s voice — your writing style, how you connect with customers, and how you portray your business in marketing campaigns all derive from your brand story. By telling visitors about yourself and how your business came to be, what your values are, and where your passions lie, you’ll create a personal and meaningful conversation with your customers around your brand. Add your full brand story to your About page and sprinkle highlights and excerpts of it (e.g. “Building sustainable play equipment since 1977”) on other prominent areas of your website like your homepage, product pages, and even purchase receipts. If you don’t grab your potential customers’ attention in the first few seconds, they’ll leave — 55% of people spend less than 15 seconds on a website. Once you have their attention, the next most important thing is to encourage customers to click through to where you ultimately want them to go. There should be multiple ways for your site visitors to find the product they’re looking for or the solution to their problem. If you only have a few products, feature them prominently on the homepage and use appealing calls to action above the fold (the area that you first see upon page load) so that customers don’t even have to open the navigation menu to search. For more involved ecommerce sites with a large variety of products, make sure that your navigation menu is organized intuitively and that your products are categorized in a way that makes sense. Use mega menus with image thumbnails to highlight specific products and popular product categories. Often, customers just want to find your site search feature and type in the name of or type of product they are looking for. Test your search functionality using product names as well as less specific keywords such as “black striped sundress.” Not satisfied with the search results? Check out extensions like Jetpack Search to add to the experience. Make sure that, on your shop and category pages, customers can easily tell your products apart, understand what each one is, and know how to find out more information. Create filters based on price, color, brand, etc. that will help your customers narrow down your product list. Include category descriptions on your category pages so shoppers know they are in the right place. Review your product pages and make sure each product description is compelling, contains important information like size charts, color variations, material content, etc. and is free from grammatical and spelling errors. Additional product details you might want to add include whether or not the product ships separately, is eligible for a discount, is a limited edition, requires specific care or storage, or requires a minimum order quantity (MOQ). If you don’t ask your customers to purchase, why would they? Use button colors that pop on the page and choose actionable language — “Buy Now,” “Shop Tees,” or “Find the Right Size.” The last thing you want is for an interested customer to leave because they can’t figure out how to check out. Make sure there is a cart icon in the top right corner of your menu that, when expanded, includes a link to the Checkout page. Then, no matter where a customer is on your site, they can make a purchase in just a few clicks. Don’t lose high-intent customers: 50% of U.S. consumers will abandon their cart if checkout takes longer than 30 seconds. So, making the purchasing process quick and easy is crucial to getting sales. You can optimize your checkout by: Are the business address, email address, and phone number easy to find? It’s a standard expectation that you have a contact page with multiple ways for your customers to get in touch. But it can also be helpful to put your customer support information in your site’s footer or offer chat bot support to help customers get connected with you quickly. When a customer logs in, you want them to be able to easily access important information like their order history, billing information, available downloads, and order tracking numbers. Review your customer account dashboard page and make sure that it contains what your customers are looking for. A favicon is the icon that appears in the browser address bar and bookmark list. A recognizable favicon makes it easy for your customers to find you again after they’ve navigated away to another tab. When a customer has your ecommerce website open on one tab and 32 other tabs of cat videos at the same time, you want to make it easy for them to get back to your store. Next on the checklist is making sure crucial functionality on your ecommerce website is working correctly. It doesn’t really matter if your ecommerce site looks beautiful and is easy to navigate if it doesn’t actually work! Check every link on all pages, products, headers, and footers and ensure that they are working. This is not only important from a functionality standpoint, but it’s important for SEO, too. If you have a large number of pages or have migrated your store over from a different ecommerce platform, you might want to run a scan using Broken Link Checker to find and update or redirect all your broken links. Make sure to disable and delete the plugin when you’re done, as it can be a drag on performance. Don’t forget to check your link behavior, too. Most internal links you’ll want to open in the same tab, but if you’re linking to external sites, you’ll want them to open in a new tab so your visitors aren’t transported away from your site completely. You may have other specialty extensions installed, like Product Add-Ons or Mix and Match Products. You’ll want to double check that all your extensions are working together without issue. Most extensions will also have a list of known compatibility issues in their documentation, so you should review that information before you purchase and install any particular extension. These are effective methods of increasing average order value, so you want to make sure they’re set up correctly. You can do this on each individual product page by going to Product Data → Linked Products. View a more thorough tutorial here. Go through your checkout process in its entirety, from adding a product to your shopping cart, applying a discount code, choosing a shipping location, and making a payment. Check each of your payment methods if you have more than one. Also try checking out and putting incorrect information in — the CVV on your credit card, for example. Does the correct message appear? Make sure an appropriate error message appears so the customer knows what the issue is. After a purchase, what happens? Do you get a notification that an order was placed? Does the customer get an order confirmation? Make sure all of these processes are in place and work with a transactional email service provider to help guarantee email delivery. If you want visual customization of emails along with advanced email and SMS marketing capabilities, check out Klaviyo. You’ve made sure emails are being sent and received, you’ve confirmed checkout is working, but you may have other forms on your site like email signup forms, contact page forms, or event registration forms. Make sure that your customer is able to submit information and receives a confirmation page or email and that you received the form submission. If you’ve migrated from another ecommerce platform, make sure that customers can log in and view existing tracking information, order history, and subscriptions, if applicable. You’ll also want to back up all of your orders from your previous ecommerce site. What happens if someone goes to a bad link or types in an incorrect URL? A 404 page is a great way to guide people to what they’re looking for — make the most of it! Include links to important pages and a search box and you may be able to turn a mistake into a sale. First and foremost, you should make sure that usernames and passwords work for your ecommerce store admins, shop managers, and customers. Next, check to see that your users are all assigned the correct role and access permissions. In addition to the default WordPress admin, editor, and subscriber roles, WooCommerce has a built-in shop management user role and customer user role. You may want to assign more granular permissions to certain staff users with an extension like User Roles Editor, or gate access to specific content or products based on membership status with WooCommerce Memberships. If your customers have to wait for your website to load, they’ll go somewhere else. In fact, 53% of consumers will leave a website if it takes longer than three seconds to load. So if your website is taking longer than three seconds to load, check to see what’s slowing your site down and fix those issues before you launch. Below are just a few steps you can take to optimize your site’s load time, but if you want a more comprehensive guide, you can check out this article explaining steps you can take to speed up your WooCommerce site. Serve compressed images that are sized appropriately for the device that they’ll be viewed on. We’ve created a detailed guide on optimizing your images so they load quickly that may be helpful if you’re not sure how to go about it. Caching is a process that temporarily stores copies of data in a location that allows for quicker access compared to retrieving it from its original source. Basically, it speeds up load time. Your host may implement server-side caching, but you can also use extensions like Jetpack or WP Super Cache to help your site load faster. Go through your WordPress backend and delete unused themes, plugins, pages, media files, and posts. Not only can they add more load to your server, slowing down your site, things like unused themes and plugins can be vulnerable to hackers. Plus, outdated content on pages and posts may confuse customers if their content shows up on search engine results pages. As a store owner, you want satisfied customers that have a great user experience on your site and enjoy the products that you sell, but all the happy shoppers in the world won’t make a difference if you don’t have your financial side set up correctly. Poorly thought-out pricing, failing to set up sales tax properly, and misconfigured payment options can all lead to disastrous results. No ecommerce checklist would be complete without asking the following financial questions: At the very minimum, you should price your products so that the retail price covers your cost of goods (COGs) and includes a certain percentage of profit. But profit margins can vary widely across industries and if your products are niche or luxury goods, markups can be significantly higher than more ubiquitous products. Make sure you’ve done some research on pricing for products similar to yours. Don’t be afraid to start off by skewing higher — you can always bring your prices down, but once shoppers get used to lower prices it can be difficult to raise them drastically and retain customers. Taxes are an important element of ecommerce businesses and you want to make sure they’re set up correctly. You can find your tax settings by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Tax. You’ll find several options there to fit your situation or you can also install the WooCommerce Tax extension to help you automatically configure sales tax. For a more in-depth guide, you can read our article about how to set up sales tax on your WooCommerce website. Regardless of how you choose to manage sales tax on your site, we do recommend consulting with an accountant or tax professional to ensure you’re taking the right steps. Check your payment gateway settings in WooCommerce → Settings → Payments and make sure they’re enabled and connected to your store. Review your accepted payment methods to make sure you’ve enabled the right ones for your store. In your payment gateway account, itself, you’ll want to ensure that your business’ bank account is connected to your payment gateway account. If your online store sells to multiple countries, you’ll want to provide customers the ability to view products in their local currency. Make sure that the currency conversions are accurate for products, shipping, taxes, and any checkout add-ons. You are launching an online store, after all, so you want to make sure you have the correct inventory count, a way to manage and track that inventory, and that your shipping methods are set up and priced correctly. Here are a few inventory and shipping-related things you should tick off your launch checklist before you go live: Go through each of your products and make sure that the inventory levels are up-to-date and correct. You can edit your inventory settings by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Products → Inventory and update stock quantities on each individual product page. WooCommerce also offers a variety of extensions that help you sync inventory with your warehouse, Amazon store, eBay store, or other platform. If you have variable products, try switching variations and make sure that prices, variation descriptions, and featured images change appropriately. Whether your shipping calculations are weight-based, product-based, or cart-based, try different combinations to make sure the numbers come out correctly. Check all of the shipping methods that you have available and try different shipping locations. You’ll also want to make sure that any shipping labels you have set up are working. It’s important for your customers to know whether or not you accept returns and what the terms are. Outline how long customers have to make a return, the required condition of the product, how refunds will be received, and who will pay for shipping. If you sell digital products on your ecommerce site, make sure that the right files are uploaded and delivered successfully after purchase. Go to WooCommerce → Settings → Products → Downloadable Products to view options for file delivery. Once your store is live, you need a way to drive potential customers to it. And once you have customers, you need to keep them engaged and coming back. On top of that, you need a way to check that your marketing plan is working. Here are a few marketing considerations to check off your ecommerce launch checklist before you share your site with the world. If someone abandons their cart, do you have a way to follow up with them? It’s rare for a customer to make a purchase the first time they visit your site, so make sure you have the measures in place to reach back out. Extensions like AutomateWoo or your own email marketing software can help with this. No marketing plan is complete without an email marketing strategy. In fact, email marketing drives more and more global revenue each year. Make sure you’re using an email marketing platform like Klaviyo or MailPoet to send special offers, news updates, blog posts, and other useful content that can drive sales. Do you know which social media channels you’ll be using to advertise your products? There are a lot of different platforms and not all of them will be the right fit for your business. Don’t spread yourself too thin or focus on a platform where your target customers don’t spend their time. Not sure which platforms you should choose? Check out our guide to choosing the right social media platforms for your store. Once you’ve chosen your platforms, you’ll want to make sure your products and advertisements are set up correctly. If you share a product on Facebook, does the right photo show up? Is your TikTok shop connected to your WooCommerce store? Are your meta titles and descriptions correct? If you need help managing some of this, the Yoast SEO plugin will allow you to edit your products’ appearance on social media. A big part of your marketing plan should be tracking its effectiveness. Google search and display ads as well as social media advertising can all be a huge driver of sales, but you also need to make sure that your ads aren’t costing you more than you’re making with each conversion. Tools like Conversion Tracking Pro for WooCommerce can seamlessly connect your store to your various advertising platforms and help you track analytics all in one place. Content marketing can help your store sell in multiple ways. You can create gift guides that inspire your customers, use blog posts about your business and products that include target keywords to improve SEO, and craft how-to guides and tutorials to help customers better understand how to use your products. Google Analytics not only monitors sales and ad performance, it also tracks a wide variety of user behavior, demographics, and traffic sources. This data can help you better understand who is visiting your site, how long they stay there, the keywords they use in search to find you, what devices they use to access your site, and more. Tools like WooCommerce Advanced Analytics Pro can give you even more advanced insights into important ecommerce metrics like average order value, conversion rate, sales by product or category, and even order refunds and cancellations. All this information can be used to help inform your approach to multiple aspects of your business and marketing strategy, including ecommerce SEO, email marketing, web design, and social media. SEO is a term with a lot of buzz around it, but for good reason. Search Engine Optimization is the art of being found on platforms like Google when people are looking for something you offer. You can spend a lot of time and money on the nuances of every aspect of ecommerce SEO — like keyword research, including the right number of internal links, perfecting your content length, and obsessing over analytics tools — but simply doing the basics right will put you a step ahead of most new ecommerce stores. The meta descriptions for your pages and products are what a customer will see when searching on Google. Make sure that they’re informative and engaging and make someone want to click on your products instead of your competitors’. In addition to your meta descriptions, you might also want to add rich snippets to your web pages. These snippets rely on specific HTML that lets you display things like reviews, product price, product carousels, business hours, and more in search results, helping your site stand out from competitors. Alt text plays a very important role in ecommerce SEO for a couple of reasons. One, it’s a primary way that Google “reads” your images and understands what they display. Two, screen readers read alt text aloud to help those that are visually impaired understand the content. Your alt text should be descriptive of the image and also contain your target keyword in a natural way. While alt text is one aspect of accessibility, there are more considerations. Make sure your font size is large enough to read. Watch out for color combinations like green and red that may make it difficult for someone with color blindness to interpret graphics or text. Add subtitles to product videos so that someone with hearing impairments understands what’s being said. Learn more about why accessibility is so important. The title of your products should be concise and descriptive. Do some keyword research to make sure that you’re formulating product titles that people are searching for. Remember, this is what they’ll see when searching for products on search engines! Your URLs should be concise and definitive. This helps people and search engines understand exactly what your product page is about. For example, it’s much easier to understand what www.example.com/red-dog-leash is about than www.example.com/index.php?id_reddogleash=360&sid=3a5ebc944f41daa6f849f730f1. Also make sure to separate words with dashes instead of underscores. An XML sitemap is essentially a blueprint of your ecommerce website that helps Google understand exactly what pages there are. You can easily generate a sitemap using Yoast SEO or a similar plugin and submit your sitemap to Google using Google Search Console. The last thing you want is for your new website to be hacked and your customers’ information compromised after you launch. That’s why it’s important that you take the right steps to secure your online store! A firewall protects your WordPress website from incoming malicious attacks. Jetpack Security is an excellent option, built by the people behind WordPress.com. Not only does it provide a firewall, but it also offers a comprehensive suite of security tools like real-time backups and downtime monitoring. An SSL certificate encrypts and protects sensitive information, like your customers’ credit card data. Not only is it important from a legal and ethical standpoint, Google also flags websites without an SSL certificate as “insecure.” This can have a negative effect on your visitors’ perception of your brand, or worse — prevent them from accessing your site at all. Use a combination of numbers, symbols, and letters that’s at least eight characters long. You may also want to consider two-factor authentication, which provides additional verification for administrators (like a code sent to your cell phone or authenticator app). This is particularly important if you have post comments or product reviews enabled. It’ll keep your site more secure and save you tons of time filtering through spam. A great solution is Askimet — just set it up and you won’t have to worry about spam again! You should have regular, automatic backups set up for your site files and your database. There are several ways to do this, through your hosting provider or with plugins like Jetpack VaultPress Backup. This tool is particularly valuable for online stores, as it takes backups in real time so you never lose a single sale or piece of customer information. It’s important that you always keep your theme, plugins, and WordPress software up-to-date. Old versions are much easier to hack into. If you’d prefer not to worry about it, just set up auto-updates in your dashboard. Last, but not least on your ecommerce website checklist: double-check (if not quadruple-check!) that you are legally compliant. Having the right legal infrastructure in place protects you from lawsuits and helps your customers understand how you use their data and how your store policies work. You may want to hire a lawyer to make sure you have everything set up to legally run your ecommerce business — it’s well worth the investment! While your lawyer should also be able to help draft your website’s terms and conditions and privacy policies, laws can change and so can the content of your site. Updating your policies regularly can become a bit of a chore. Fortunately there are some online services that allow you to create legally-compliant policies for your ecommerce site that update automatically. Regardless of the route you take to meet your legal obligations, make sure these are easy to find on your ecommerce website. Ask yourself: Terms and conditions lay out the rules of conduct between you and your website visitors that must be followed if they want to purchase your products. To add a checkbox for customers to agree to your terms on your checkout page, navigate to WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced and select a Terms and Conditions page. A good privacy policy explains exactly how you’ll handle customer information and data on your ecommerce website. It establishes credibility and is an important layer of protection for your business. You can add a link to your privacy policy on your Checkout page by going to WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced and selecting a Privacy Policy page. GDPR is a law concerning data handling for European residents. This applies to you if you sell to anyone in the E.U., even if you’re not located there. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with it and adjust policies if needed. You can learn more in our GDPR article hub. The final thing you should do before launch is to have real people test your site. Ask employees, friends, family or, better yet, members of your target audience to use the site and note anything they find difficult or confusing. There’s nothing better than having a fresh set of unbiased eyes going through everything. As the saying goes, “Measure twice, cut once.” It’s better to get as much as possible right before you launch so that expensive mistakes don’t haunt you later on. Want professional support? If you aren’t already working with an agency, check out our vetted Woo agency partners who have been through the launch process many times and can provide guidance to set you up for ecommerce success. About Customize buttons Great, thank you so much for this post! My website is already launched, but I’ve found a lot of useful tips and points to check out on my website. Especially I recommend everyone to pay more attention to the legal side of your business and security stuff because I know that amazing website can attract visitors, but if these points are weak, they won’t turn into your customers. Absolutely! Legal and security aspects are often overlooked, but they’re definitely critical to a successful website. Glad you found these tips useful! Great! Bookmarking this! It’s fantastic how minutely you’ve covered all pre-requisites at one single space with the best-required details! This is really going to help a lot! WooCommerce community, I bow!

Nvidia (NVDA) and other semiconductor stocks slid Friday amid worries about worsening U.S.-China trade tensions. Shares of Nvidia were down nearly 4% in recent trading. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and Applied Materials (AMAT) also lost ground, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropping about 3%. Some of Nvidia's partners, including server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI), saw their stocks fall as well. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) President Trump on Friday said China has "totally violated its agreement with us," dampening hopes the countries would soon come to a longer-term agreement after reaching a temporary truce earlier this month. Separately, Bloomberg reported Friday that Trump plans to expand U.S. companies' licensing requirements to make deals with Chinese companies that have ties to sanctioned firms. The development comes after the Trump administration moved earlier this month to rescind the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that would have further curbed sales of American AI hardware to a broader group of countries, but warned it's looking to replace the rule with new restrictions. Analysts at Citi and Deutsche Bank warned at the time that they could turn out to be stricter than Biden's. During Nvidia's earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang said it's "terrific" that Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule, but criticized the administration's other moves to limit its sales to China, saying that "shielding Chinese chipmakers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position." The AI chipmaker took a $4.5 billion charge in its fiscal first quarter associated with new export curbs on the company's H20 chips to China, and said it expects to take an $8 billion hit in the current quarter due to lost revenue.

Title: Boycotts Are Back: Queer Travelers Fight Bigotry With Their Wallets
URL: https://www.yesmagazine.org/body-politics/2025/05/30/queer-travelers-boycott-history
Time Published: 2025-05-30T17:39:08Z
Full Content:
At a time when our government is denying the existence of trans people, erasing trans rights, and generally undoing the progress made toward LGBTQ+ equality in the U.S., boycotts are an outlet for collective anger and a means of fighting bigotry. LGBTQ+ history is filled with powerful stories of queer and trans people advocating for our rights by using every tool available, whether it’s seeking justice through the legal system or pushing back against police violence—yes at Stonewall, but also at Compton’s Cafeteria and the hundreds of other, lesser-known protests that came before. Yet boycotts haven’t played as central a role in LGBTQ+ liberation as they did during the civil rights movement. “We’re ultimately a fairly small group,” says Eli Erlick, activist and author of Before Gender: Lost Stories From Trans History, 1850–1950. And since companies haven’t historically valued queer consumers, the impact of a boycott is diluted. Still, boycotts have been an important tool for liberation. “Queer communities have used boycotts to amplify voices when mainstream media and politics ignored them,” says Jay Santana, an LGBTQ+ historian and activist. “These actions created not just pressure, but visibility.” In the 1970s, the LGBTQ community and the labor movement united to protest discriminatory labor practices at Coors, where employees were disqualified from being hired if they were gay or pro-union. At that time, homophobia was widespread in the labor movement, but labor leaders also recognized the organizing power within the LGBTQ+ community, and the organizing talents of Harvey Milk and other LGBTQ+ leaders. Bay Area gay bars refused to stock Coors—to this day, many still don’t carry it—and bartenders ceremoniously poured out beer in the streets. The Coors boycott helped broker an alliance between LGBTQ+ people and union workers. In 1977, Miami-Dade County, Florida, passed an ordinance that prohibited discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. Christian singer Anita Bryant, who was a spokesperson for the Florida Citrus Commission, instantly began campaigning for its repeal by claiming that LGBTQ+ people groomed children. In response, LGBTQ+ leaders organized a boycott of Florida oranges and orange juice. Bartenders poured orange juice out in the streets. Protestors wore cheeky merch. The boycott earned more than 50,000 newspaper mentions and made gay rights a mainstream conversation topic. Though Bryant won the battle and the nondiscrimination ordinance was repealed, she lost the war. “The universal anger directed at Anita Bryant was so strong that others joined the struggle and Anita was fired and the LGBTQ+ community had an important victory post Stonewall,” says Robert Kesten, president and CEO of Stonewall National Museum, Archives & Library. In the years after the Florida orange juice boycott, HIV/AIDS spread through the gay community. We spent our collective energy caring for one another and organizing to demand the callously indifferent Reagan administration respond to the public health crisis. Things were pretty quiet until the same-sex marriage debates. When Chick-fil-A’s CEO spoke out against same-sex marriage in 2012, public outrage was swift. College students protested Chick-fil-A opening locations on their campuses. Local officials in Boston, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. vowed to prevent Chick-fil-A from opening or expanding in their market. In the short term, sales increased as sympathetic conservatives bought chicken sandwiches in droves. However, the backlash forced Chick-fil-A to publicly apologize. While the company quit funding anti-LGBTQ causes in 2019, they’re still perceived as anti-queer, which has cost Chick-fil-A opportunities to expand. When North Carolina passed the first anti-trans bathroom bill in the U.S. in 2016, the ensuing mass boycott felt like a sea change. PayPal and Deutsche Bank nixed plans to expand into North Carolina, costing the state 650 new jobs. Musicians including Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam, and Demi Lovato canceled appearances. The NCAA and NBA relocated events to more inclusive states. The anti-trans bill cost North Carolina between $450 million and $630 million, according to Politifact. Though that was only around 0.1% of the state’s overall GDP, it was enough for the state’s politicians to nix HB2 in 2017. In its place, the state’s legislators passed HB142, which kept many of the anti-LGBTQ+ elements of the hated bathroom bill. Most crucially, HB142 prevented local communities from passing LGBTQ+ non-discrimination ordinances for three years. These subtleties were seemingly overlooked as public opinion celebrated what seemed to be a victory. I traveled to Asheville, North Carolina, when HB2 was in effect. While Asheville is a progressive city, I dreaded using public restrooms and being misgendered. The broad support for the boycott was comforting. It was one of a few times I’ve felt like my country was on my side. Anti-trans measures have only grown in the years since HB2’s repeal. “It’s alarming when [anti-trans sentiment] is so widespread that it becomes normalized and impossible to enact boycotts,” says Erlick. With Donald Trump back in office and committed to using executive orders to erase trans rights—not to mention the very word “transgender”—a collective fury has spurred a resurgence of calls to boycott corporations that abandoned DEI. Take Target, which lost $12.4 billion in market value earlier this year, as consumers have used an economic boycott to protest the company’s decision to cancel DEI initiatives. Jamal H. Bryant, the senior pastor at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, subsequently called for a 40-day boycott of Target that was timed to coincide with Lent. LGBTQ+ consumers, still angry about the retailer’s prior waffling on whether to sell Pride merch, joined in. Now the boycott is indefinite, foot traffic hasn’t recovered, and Target’s reputation is in tatters. “Target could have made a very different decision,” says Santana, pointing to the success of retailers like Costco, which stood by DEI and saw double-digit growth in response. Erlick agrees, noting, “Corporations are ultimately not that supportive of our communities outside of superficial initiatives.” The hollowness of brand promises can be painful to realize. But once we come to terms with the shallowness of corporate pledges, queer and trans people can seek ways to leverage our collective power. Santana points to the Tesla Takedown protests, a series of decentralized protests held at Tesla dealerships nationwide earlier this year, as Americans registered their discontent with government cuts proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk in his role as adviser to Trump, as an example of what’s possible now. Tesla Takedown protests have brought joy and hope in dark times and, more crucially, caused a leadership crisis and plummeting stock prices for Tesla. When claims of homophobia or transphobia are dismissed as individual sensitivity or snowflake behavior, or minimized with labels like “culture war,” Santana says boycotts name the harm, which helps LGBTQ+ people to heal. Increasingly, travelers to the United States—and entire countries—are also refusing to cosign our nation’s bigotry with their tourist dollars. The most vocal critic has been Canada, whose citizens are seemingly furious with the U.S. over tariffs, broad anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment, and calls to annex Canada and make it the 51st state. In response, Canadians have begun canceling their vacations to the U.S. and dumping bourbon and other imported products. Close allies like Germany, Finland, and the United Kingdom have warned LGBTQ+ citizens against visiting the U.S., amplifying the persecution of trans Americans and validating our outrage.

Title: The Long Haul To Autonomy Is Getting Started As Leaders Show The Way

ByRichard Bishop ByRichard Bishop, Contributor. Volvo Trucks is bringing autonomy to freight movement in the U.S. The autonomous truck crowd descended on Anaheim last month for the annual Advanced Clean Transportation (ACT) show. ACT has been operating for more than decade and the focus has gradually expanded from “clean propulsion” to include other cutting-edge technologies in logistics. Within the massive Expo Hall, 12,000 attendees examined the latest tech from truck and engine makers, trailer manufacturers, energy suppliers, charging infrastructure, intelligent tire makers, innovations in all types of alternative energy, along with self-driving trucks. For autonomy, the focus was on driverless trucks shifting trailers in logistics yards as well as long haul operations. My recent article covered logistics yard operations. Here’s to review the latest accomplishments, plans, and statements from the companies focused on long haul that were present at ACT. Truck autonomy developer Plus had a substantial exhibit and used this to provide informational talks from executives each day. The exhibit highlighted Plus’s production tie-up with the TRATON Group, as well as testing which is underway with Hyundai fuel cell trucks in North America. Separately, Plus has partnered with IVECO Trucks for production of autonomous vehicles, making Plus the only AV developer working with two European-based manufacturers. Within TRATON, the near-term action is happening with their U.S. focused subsidiary International Truck. Working with International engineers, Plus is conducting validation of its self-driving highway capability in the Texas Triangle area, where International has a manufacturing plant. This follows test-track based validation in Ohio with no driver behind the wheel. Peter Hafmar, Vice President and Head of Autonomous Solutions at Scania, leads the coordination of Autonomous Solutions for the TRATON GROUP. In an interview at ACT, Mr. Hafmar noted their many years of evaluating and partnering in the autonomy space. “We developed in-house expertise in autonomous driving so as to assess potential suppliers, and our evaluation of Plus led to our production partnership with them.” The partnership was announced early last year. Within TRATON, International will be the first to offer autonomous trucks to their customers. “Customers in the U.S. have tried AV trucks from various developers. They are very well informed. These leaders are ready to go when the product is released,” he said. The company has said that the first rollout of Plus-powered autonomous trucks will occur in 2027. Noting that European launches will follow with brands Scania, MAN, and Volkswagen Truck and Bus, Mr. Hafmar is upbeat about regulatory allowance of autonomous trucks there. The most vexing challenge currently relates to border crossings within the European Union, which he believes will be resolved by EU-wide legislation. Across the board, Mr. Hafmar emphasizes that the use case must include terminal-to-terminal services. Therefore, their AV’s must be capable of running on the main highway as well as surface streets nearby to the highway to reach freight terminals. In a Truck Tech episode from ACT Expo, FreightWaves’ Thomas Wasson interviewed Plus COO & Co-Founder Shawn Kerrigan about Plus’s tech. “We have a global collaboration across all TRATON brands to bring this technology to life in products they can deploy to their customers. Our focus as a software tech developer is to enable the truck OEM to create autonomous trucks that they can deliver to their customers, the fleets. Our customer and partner are the OEMs. We’re excited about this global collaboration with TRATON,” he said. The pace of activity continues to gain momentum. In an interview on the ACT Expo floor, David Liu, Plus Co-Founder and CEO, told me that “in the second half of this year, our pilots in Texas will expand to serve new fleets.” Truck autonomy developer Aurora had their autonomous truck on display at ACT, providing a low-key presence at the event. Although attendees didn’t know it at the time, Aurora trucks were already on the road running driverless in commercial freight hauling – a world first. For months, Aurora had assured investors that this launch would happen in April 2025 and they made good on the promise, even though the announcement came a couple of weeks later. Subsequent news was jarring, in that pressure from PACCAR (the manufacturer of the trucks in service) resulted in Aurora installing a human observer in the vehicles as they traverse the Dallas-to-Houston route. However, a human observer is not the same as a safety driver; the autonomy is doing the driving. Although the mainstream media lapped up this apparent stumble, I see this as only a blip in the larger picture. In parallel, Bleeker Street Research published a damning analysis of Aurora (funds managed by Bleecker Street are short Aurora Innovation). The Bleeker report questioned the validity of Aurora’s business model and many other facets. Of greatest concern was their assertion that Volvo Trucks will not be producing autonomy-ready trucks starting in 2027. According to this report, it will be more like 2030. Aurora has production agreements with two OEMs, Volvo and PACCAR. Thus, a production delay from one truck maker can theoretically be offset by the other. So far, neither Aurora nor Volvo Trucks have commented on the Bleeker Street assertions. Until they do, a cloud will hang over Aurora, depressing the stock price and leaving us all scratching our heads. Volvo Trucks is forging a unique path, that of manufacturing large quantities of autonomous trucks which they will operate themselves to move long haul freight in the U.S. The term of art is “Transportation as a Service” or TAAS. Lars Stenqvist, Executive Vice President, Volvo Group Trucks Technology and Volvo Group Chief Technology Officer, commented on this unique approach in an interview while sitting down with me at the Volvo Group exhibit area. “How hands-on will Volvo be with AV customers once new trucks are delivered to them?,” I asked. His response was succinct: “100 percent, due to our TAAS approach.” “Our aim is to create the market for autonomy by running loads for companies like DHL and Uber Freight. We already have customers signed up,” he added. He emphasized that TAAS is the focus and “there are no sales of AV trucks on the horizon.” Volvo Autonomous Solutions (VAS) is leading the charge. Nils Jaeger, president of VAS, and I discussed their tactical approach. “At VAS, we aim to learn the benefits of AV by directly running freight,” he said. “Autonomous trucking will bring a revolution in transport, even pulling loads from air freight. The shift is big and an individual fleet cannot get there easily,” he added. VAS sees itself working top-down, addressing the challenging aspects of launching autonomous trucking operations, which they view as a service to their customers. In his view, many of their legacy customers are wary of autonomous trucks. VAS can show them the way forward, i.e. how to commercialize. Echoing his colleague at TRATON, Mr. Jaeger is also bullish about Europe. He is optimistic that the proper regulations will soon be in place to enable automated trucking throughout the European Union. He noted Australia and the UAE as other areas which may come on-line soon. Mr. Jaeger emphasized the importance of having multiple autonomy suppliers, i.e. Aurora and Waabi. Having multiple suppliers is a long-standing principle within the vehicle industry to reduce risk from any supply problems from a particular supplier. Testing is underway now by VAS in Texas on the Dallas-Houston freight lane. Mr. Jaeger is confident VAS trucks will roll out across the Sunbelt and the entire continental U.S. Of course, the companies that elected to be at ACT do not comprise the entire space. Daimler Trucks and Torc Robotics are well along in their plans to commercialize by 2027 and are currently doing extensive testing in Texas. Waabi has said they will launch driverless operations in Texas later this year. Gatik has said they will go driverless with short haul “Freight Only” operations this year as well. And newcomer Bot Auto plans to begin driver-out operations in the coming months, running freight between Houston and San Antonio. Will the road freight world change overnight? In concluding our discussion at ACT, I asked Peter Hafmar what we might be talking about twenty years from now at ACT 2045. “There will be an extensive AV EV transportation network. But change does not come overnight, it occurs over decades.” Spoken like the industry veteran that he is, who has seen fads come and go, while tech advancement which endures comes at its own pace. Disclosure: Richard Bishop is an Advisor to and/or an equity holder in the following companies mentioned in this article: Aurora, Gatik, Plus. May 31, 2025: This article was updated to clarify that Volvo Trucks has not stated a specific date for production of driverless trucks.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs See $9 Billion Inflows Amid Escalating Shift Away From Gold

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Recent trends in the Bitcoin ETFs market reveal a significant shift in investor sentiment, with funds flowing into BTC exchange-traded funds while gold-backed funds experience notable outflows. According to a Bloomberg report, US Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $9 billion in inflows in the past five weeks, primarily driven by BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). In contrast, gold-backed funds have seen outflows exceeding $2.8 billion during the same time frame. This divergence in investor behavior comes as easing trade tensions have diminished demand for traditional safe havens like gold. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a viable alternative store of value amid growing concerns about US fiscal stability. Furthermore, the market’s leading cryptocurrency reached a record high of $111,980, buoyed by favorable regulatory developments and rising macroeconomic uncertainty. Although gold remains up more than 25% this year, it has retreated from its recent peaks, currently trading approximately $190 below its all-time high. Analysts suggest that this rotation towards Bitcoin ETFs indicates a growing acceptance of the cryptocurrency as a legitimate hedge within investment portfolios. Christopher Wood, global equity strategist at Jefferies, expressed optimism for both gold and Bitcoin, noting their effectiveness as hedges against currency debasement in the G7 nations. However, skeptics argue that Bitcoin’s notorious volatility still undermines its position as a true safe haven. Historical instances of macroeconomic shocks have shown Bitcoin falling sharply alongside other risk assets. Yet, some experts believe that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature gives it an advantage over gold in times of financial system risks. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, highlighted Bitcoin’s dual role as a hedge against both private sector risks, such as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, and government-related concerns, including the stability of the US Treasury. Kendrick pointed out that recent threats to Federal Reserve (Fed) independence, alongside tariff escalations and broader concerns about US policy credibility, further bolster Bitcoin’s appeal. In addition to these factors, Bitcoin appears to be shedding its previous reputation as merely a tech-adjacent risk asset. Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone, noted that Bitcoin’s intraday correlation with major indices like the Nasdaq, as well as with the dollar and gold, has significantly decreased. The backdrop of growing fiscal strain has intensified the discourse surrounding these assets. Moody’s recently downgraded the US from its last triple-A credit rating, citing concerns over ballooning deficits and national debt. This downgrade aligns the US with other ratings agencies, including Fitch and S&P Global, which already rate the country below the top tier. Despite the recent surge in Bitcoin’s popularity, gold continues to outperform on a year-to-date basis, boasting gains of about 25% compared to Bitcoin’s rise of approximately 15%.

Title: STEPHEN MOORE: Why Are Trump’s Regulators Fighting A War On Coal?

In one of the most convoluted lawsuits of all time, a cabal of state attorney generals and the Federal Trade Commission are now accusing financial firms Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard of monopolistic behavior. The complaint asserts that these firms bought coal stocks and then helped impose radical environmental restrictions on the companies they partially own, so that coal output would fall and the price of coal would rise. The lawsuit alleges that this strategy generated “supra-competitive profits” for those investors. If your head is spinning around trying to make heads or tails out of this loopy conspiracy theory – it should be. If it were true, then these asset managers must be capable of pulling off the equivalent of a triple-bank shot in billiards. They allegedly invested in coal companies, then partnered together with climate change groups to drive coal companies bankrupt, which then drove up the price of coal. If that tactic worked to make money, Kelloggs would stop making Frosted Flakes so that the price of the last boxes on the grocery store shelves sold for $100. (RELATED: STEPHEN MOORE: Biden’s Student Loan Forgiveness Made Defaults Skyrocket) What’s laughable about this lawsuit is that the Vanguards of the world didn’t need to conspire to restrict coal production: that’s what Democrats like Joe Biden and the environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, have been doing for years. They are the ones who are guilty of any conspiracy to rip off consumers, bankrupt an American industry, put blue collar workers out of jobs, and raise energy prices. They ran multi-million dollar campaigns to “kill coal” by advancing a “net zero” fossil fuel energy policy on America with the explicit goal of shutting down coal plants. Their plan – at least temporarily – wildly succeeded. Over the past 15 years, 63 major coal companies have closed their mining operations. And just where exactly are these Supra-profits” that the FTC and the state lawyers are asserting? It’s true that for a short while in 2022 and 2023 coal and oil profits soared as a result of Biden’s war on energy. Maybe this isn’t taught in the top law schools, but money management firms with trillions of dollars of asset like Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard don’t invest in companies and then try to steer them into bankruptcy. That’s a money-losing proposition every time – except in Mel Brooks’ famous broadway show The Producers in which two scamsters conspire to make a show that would intentionally flop. That was a make-believe comedy. This lawsuit is too, but no one is laughing. Even the claim that the three firms on trial here worked with environmental groups to reduce coal output is highly suspect. It is true that some of the large investment companies promoted the radical climate agenda? And just like Bud Light, they paid a hefty price for their political activism. Unleash Prosperity – a group I cofounded – has done the seminal analysis over the last several years on how investment firms voted on radical green agenda shareholder resolutions dealing with among other things shutting down coal. It is true that State Street has been a strong and persistent supporter of some of these shareholder resolutions aimed at advancing the radical anti-coal green agenda. But Vanguard almost never votes in favor of resolutions hostile to the industry. And Blackrock in recent years has sworn off the ESG investing fad. So they all can’t all be guilty here since their shareholder activism runs in opposite directions! Apparently, their real crime was owning coal stocks at all. If this lawsuit were to succeed, then three of America’s largest investors would pay a giant penalty for that sin. The biggest loser will be the coal industry itself, as a guilty verdict would chase billions of dollars of desperately investment out of the coal industry for many years which will mean coal miners will lose their jobs. This may explain why many of the state attorney generals from coal producing states like Kentucky and Ohio didn’t join this flimsy case. Sadly, Andrew Ferguson, the chair of the FTC, may do more to destroy the coal industry than all of the radical climate change groups put together. But wait. Trump has run for president and signed executive orders to support King Coal in America. He wants an American coal renaissance. How can that happen when the FTC stands ready to sue these company’s investors if they dare make “supra profits?” Sounds like if Trump wants to make American coal great again, he might want to make a call over to his handpicked FTC chair Andrew Ferguson and get him to cease and desist.

Title: SEC clarifies proof-of-stake isn’t ‘security’ – Road clear for spot ETH ETF staking?

There’s only one obstacle for ETH ETF to clear before staking approval. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Division of Corporation Finance, clarified that some staking activities are not security transactions. Commenting on the directive, Commissioner Hester Pierce acknowledged it as a ‘welcome clarity’ for firms offering staking services. “Today’s statement provides welcome clarity for stakers and “staking-as-a-service” providers in the United States. The Division’s statement is applicable to persons who self-stake certain covered crypto assets on a proof-of-stake or delegated proof-of-stake network.” This meant that PoS systems like Ethereum [ETH], Solana [SOL], Cardano, and others are non-securities. Besides, the guidance applied to self and custodial (delegated) staking, including liquid staking, according to Rebecca Rettig, Jito Labs’ legal officer. “This bodes very well for other types of non-custodial staking activity, including liquid staking.” Compared to the Biden-era regime, this was a massive shift. The Biden-era SEC fined Kraken exchange $30M, claiming that its staking service constituted unregistered security offerings. Now, under the new Trump-era SEC, offering such service doesn’t need registration with the agency. This followed a similar update on PoW (proof-of-work) or mining-based blockchains like Bitcoin. Put differently, both PoW and PoS arrangements aren’t securities offerings. This begs the question: Will the agency greenlight the much-sought U.S. spot ETH ETF staking? ETF Store’s Nate Geraci noted that the only remaining hurdle was the IRS tax clarification. “Another hurdle cleared for staking in spot ETH ETFs. Now need clarity from IRS on how staking revenue handled in grantor trust (which is the structure used for spot ETH ETFs).” In Q2, ETH staking saw renewed interest, growing from 33M ETH to over 34M ETH, with an average annualized return of 3%. If approved, ETF buyers could enjoy these staking rewards without worrying about the complicated ways of staking individual ETH or the risks involved. So, staking rewards could improve demand for products apart from relying on price appreciation alone. In fact, most ETH ETF holders were underwater, according to Glassnode. “The average investor in the BlackRock and Fidelity Ethereum ETFs are now substantially underwater on their position, holding an unrealized loss of approximately -21% on average.” Source: Glassnode That said, the positive news didn’t stir the ETH price. In fact, the altcoin’s spot market demand declined further, as shown by the downward movement on the spot CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta). But, the Open Interest (OI) remained elevated, suggesting high speculative interest and market leverage. Source: Coinalyze Unless ETH’s pot market demand improves, the high leverage could complicate the rally and heighten liquidation risks. At press time, the altcoin was valued at $2.62K and has been consolidating between $2.3K and $2.7K in May.

Title: BYD Overtakes Tesla in Europe for the First Time, Sales Jump 169 Percent

Editor Economy Mike Shedlock, MishTalk BYD sold 7,231 battery electric vehicles in April versus 7,165 by Tesla, according to data from Jato Dynamics. BYD Is #1 In Europe Please note BYD overtakes Tesla in Europe BYD sold more battery electric vehicles (BEVs) than market leader Tesla in Europe for the first time last month, as the Chinese carmaker continued to make inroads despite hefty tariffs on cars imported from the mainland. Shenzhen-based BYD, which also makes plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), sold 7,231 BEVs in April, a year-on-year increase of 169 per cent, according to data compiled by market research firm Jato Dynamics from 28 countries in Europe. Tesla’s sales fell 49 per cent to 7,165 units in the same period. “Although the difference between the two brands’ monthly sales totals may be small, the implications are enormous,” said Felipe Munoz, a global analyst at Jato Dynamics, on Thursday. “This is a watershed moment for Europe’s car market, particularly when you consider that Tesla has led the European BEV market for years, while BYD only officially began operations beyond Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022.” Despite huge tariffs imposed by the European Union (EU), Chinese firms’ BEV sales jumped 59 per cent year on year in April to nearly 15,300 units, while carmakers from Europe, Japan, South Korea and the US posted a 26 per cent increase in sales, it added. In the PHEV segment, Chinese carmakers’ sales surged 546 per cent year on year to 9,649 units, accounting for nearly 10 per cent of PHEVs registered in the bloc. In response to disruptions from US tariffs, the EU and China are negotiating the European levies and exploring the possibility of setting a price floor for Chinese EVs. Chinese EV makers are also speeding up the construction of factories on the continent to counter the tariffs. BYD’s first European car factory in Hungary is expected to start production in the second half of this year. BYD also planned to establish its European headquarters and a new research and development centre in Hungary, CEO and president Wang Chuanfu said this week. BYDs would sell in the US too were it not for 100 percent tariffs. Would You Pay $15,000 for this Nice-Looking EV Toyota? On May 4, 2025, I asked Would You Pay $15,000 for this Nice-Looking EV Toyota? Zoomers? I am sure many would say yes, but there’s a catch. But the Toyota bZ3X is real, and it is actually on sale starting at that price. There is a catch: To buy one, you have to be in China. Tesla has two models widely available—Model 3 and Model Y—and both have been on the market for years. China’s BYD has about 25 models, according to the market-analysis firm Inovev, and is constantly introducing more. Pay More – Get Less That is Trump’s unofficial motto as well as the UAW and Teamsters. The BZ3X would be a hot seller in the US at $15,000 or even $20,000. But Trump wants you to to pay more. His 145 percent tariff that would price the car at $37,000 or so. Trump finds it easy to get the economically clueless on his side with chants of “They are stealing out jobs; they are ripping us off; and it’s unfair trade”. Trump never asks, would you like a $15,000 EV Toyota Related Posts April 14, 2025: Trump’s Plan to Make Manufacturing Great Again in Pictures The share of manufacturing employment keeps declining.

Title: Buy MSFT Stock At $460?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 23 May 2025, Bavaria, Munich: The Microsoft logo and lettering can be seen on the Microsoft ... More Deutschland GmbH headquarters building in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on May 23, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has experienced a notable increase of 16% over the last month, surpassing the S&P 500’s 6% rise. This growth is primarily attributed to Microsoft’s impressive Q1 earnings exceeding expectations and a positive outlook, bolstered by its dominance in cloud computing and AI, especially with significant Azure growth. However, following its recent ascent, is MSFT stock still worth buying? Yes, we believe that MSFT stock, which is currently priced around $460, offers an appealing buying opportunity. Though its present valuation is elevated compared to the benchmark index, making it susceptible to negative events, we do not see any significant reasons for concern. Our assessment stems from a thorough evaluation of Microsoft’s present valuation relative to its historical operational performance and financial condition. We have examined Microsoft against key criteria: Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience. This evaluation indicates a robust operational performance and financial status, which we will explain in more detail below. That being said, if you are looking for upside potential with lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — it has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its launch. Separately, see – Nvidia Stock’s 1 Big Risk Based on the price you pay per dollar of sales or profit, MSFT stock appears overpriced in relation to the broader market. Microsoft’s Revenues have experienced significant growth in recent years. Microsoft’s profit margins are significantly higher than those of most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Microsoft’s financial position is very solid. MSFT stock has experienced an impact that was slightly more favorable than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Concerned about how a market crash might affect MSFT stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Microsoft Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a comprehensive analysis of how the stock fared during and after previous market crashes. In conclusion, Microsoft’s performance across the evaluated criteria is as follows: Microsoft has showcased strong performance in key financial metrics. Although its current valuation seems elevated compared to the broader market, it is consistent with Microsoft’s own historical performance. For example, the current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12.6x aligns with its 12.4x average over the past four years. Similarly, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35x is in line with the stock’s average P/E during the same timeframe. Looking forward, significant growth in Azure is expected to fuel further increases in valuation multiples. The company’s revenue growth over the next three years is projected to average in the low double-digits, compared to a 12% average over the preceding three years. Overall, despite its recent increases, we believe MSFT stock continues to be an attractive buy at current levels. In fact, we estimate Microsoft’s valuation to be $535 per share, indicating over 15% upside potential. Nevertheless, it is vital to recognize potential risks. A downturn in economic growth or a recession could result in decreased corporate investments in infrastructure, potentially affecting Microsoft’s revenue growth. Even though MSFT stock has historically performed better than the benchmark index during economic downturns, a decline in its stock price during such situations cannot be dismissed. Not entirely satisfied with the volatile nature of MSFT stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven history of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a more stable investment experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

One answer, and an increasingly popular one at that, is: pivot to crypto—or more specifically, become a crypto treasury company. The previously unknown online gambling marketer SharpLink Gaming did just that earlier this week, when it announced it had raised $425 million in investment to establish an Ethereum treasury. It was a notable departure from the more common route of building a Bitcoin treasury, with Ethereum being the second largest and most liquid crypto asset on the market next to Bitcoin. As part of the raise, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin joined SharpLink’s board of directors. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) Before going all in on Ethereum, SharpLink had a market capitalization of around $2 million, trading for just over $2 per share and was just weeks ago dangerously close to being delisted from the Nasdaq for falling below the $1 per share minimum. On Tuesday, everything changed: The company’s stock jumped 420% to $35 per share, with a market cap above $23 million. It’s a strategy reminiscent of, well, Strategy. Michael Saylor’s company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, laid down the blueprint for how this works: you buy up a bunch of Bitcoin (or, in Sharplink’s case, Ethereum), and your stock functions as a proxy bet on the crypto asset. Shares in a crypto treasury company will often trade at a premium to the digital assets because, for the average investor, it’s much easier to buy stock than fiddle around with crypto directly. Before being worth $101.76 billion and amassing a Bitcoin treasure chest worth over $60 billion, MicroStrategy was floundering at a double-digit share price as a fairly average business intelligence software solutions company. MicroStrategy then bought $425 million in Bitcoin in the fall of 2020. The same amount in Ethereum that SharpLink plans to buy. Back in 2020, MicroStrategy came out of nowhere. Just like SharpLink did Tuesday. So what is SharpLink, and where did it come from? SharpLink was co-founded in 2019 by now-CEO Rob Phythian and former COO Chris Nicholas, who left the company in 2024. Tori Roberts joined the team in 2021 as vice president, in charge of affiliate marketing with Robert DeLucia following in 2022 as chief financial officer. According to the official SharpLink site, there are also three independent directors in Leslie Bernhard, Robert Gutkowski, and Obie McKenzie that make up the board of directors, chaired by Phythian himself. Bernhard has previously served as a director and chairman in multiple Nasdaq-listed companies, Gutkowski helped seal a $486 million cable distribution deal, and McKenzie was a managing director at BlackRock. So, it appears at least, the directors are a capable bunch. Put simply, SharpLink Gaming uses technology to help match sports betting companies with fans. According to its LinkedIn page, the company now uses an AI tool that collects and analyzes behavioral insights on users, pushes relevant betting content onto those users, and converts them into paying customers. Trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker SBET, it currently sits at a market cap of $55 million trading at nearly $80 per share, already doubling its price since Tuesday, according to data on Trading View. If you bought SBET stock five years ago, though, you’re still down around 67%. The company’s revenues declined 26.1% from 2023 to 2024, last year's financial report showed, with cash on hand decreasing by 42.2% to $1.43 million. That said, it saw a positive net income of $10 million, a notable rise from a net loss of $14.2 million. In 2024, SharpLink Gaming sold two of its businesses for $22.5 million, used most of these proceeds to write off outstanding debts, and completed a domestic merger that changed the company from an Israeli LLC to a Delaware corporation, according to a company release. In July 2024, the board of directors started a formal review process to “evaluate strategic alternatives” that would “drive growth and create and maximize value” for stockholders. It appears that in this process, the board of directors started to consider cryptocurrency more seriously. In February 2025, the company announced that it acquired a 10% equity stake in Armchair Enterprises Limited, a company that owns CryptoCasino.com, as part of a strategy to become the “first Nasdaq-listed company focused on crypto gaming.” “We carefully evaluated more than two dozen compelling opportunities,” SharpLink CEO Phythian said in a release, referencing the board’s review process. “And [we] determined that the combination of market expansion, cost efficiency, security and player demand makes crypto gaming one of the most promising growth opportunities in the online gaming industry today.” But this initial crypto pivot wasn’t enough to prevent the price of SBET stock from dropping 60.8%, from $5.75 to $2.26, over the next two and a half months. During this period, SharpLink announced a reverse stock split to stay above Nasdaq’s stock price minimum requirement of $1. And then a $4.5 million public stock offering in order to regain “compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum requirement for total stockholders’ equity.” Things were existential for SharpLink. But that was before the Ethereum treasury strategy led its stock price to surge 420% on Tuesday to $35 a share—and now more than doubling that. Rob Phythian co-founded SharpLink and today serves as its CEO and chairman of the board of directors. And now he’s the Ethereum Michael Saylor. Pythian founded SharpLink after he spent almost nine and a half years as CEO of SportsHub Technologies, a company that created games and apps for sports gaming sites. Prior to that, he’d also co-founded SportsData LLC, a sports experience creator, and served as its CEO and president. During his time at SportsHub, he was named by a local business publication as one of the top 100 people to know in Minnesota. Phythian was hailed a pioneer and a “sports tech godfather.” One former business partner told Decrypt that he has great respect for Pythian. "I worked with Rob maybe 10 or 15 years ago on [an unnamed] skill gaming venture,” Matthew Warneford, CEO of Roblox game creator Dubit, told Decrypt. “Rob's a great guy, very smart, and good to work with. Have nothing but positive things to say." By 2023, now CEO of SharpLink, Phythian and his company started to embrace artificial intelligence. In a guest blog post for Sportico, he outlined a future where AI could help personalize the sport fan experience, while also batting away concerns that AI outputs are too generic as he believed that the tide was turning. A year later, it was clear that the company needed a new direction, and Pythian led the company through its shift to crypto gaming. And now he’s leading SharpLink into its next phase as the Microstrategy of Ethereum. The question now is: Will it work? If Phythian follows Saylor’s playbook, then the next step will be to sell shares, or debt against those shares, to buy more Ethereum. Then rise and repeat. That likely bodes well for ETH—and perhaps even SBET shareholders. But what it means for SharpLink as a business is an open question. It’s a gamble, but one that so far appears to be paying off.

Title: Why Ethereum’s 45.98% Q2 returns might just be the start of what’s next

Stay tuned as ETH looks to extend its outperformance and challenge new highs. Though fleeting, a sharp divergence on the 29th of May threw a curveball at the crypto crowd. Ethereum [ETH] surged 1.87% intraday, breaking out to a fresh three-month high at $2,791. Meanwhile, Bitcoin [BTC] took a counter move, dipping 2.01%. According to AMBCrypto, it underscored a rare ETH-BTC decoupling that’s turning heads on the order books: Could this subtle divergence be the spark that ignites Ethereum’s next power rally? Q2 has been nothing short of a flex for Ethereum. It has nearly doubled returns, leaving Bitcoin’s 30.2% gains eating dust, despite BTC notching fresh all-time highs. Still, most of the liquidity has been BTC-bound, with ETH grinding sideways for weeks. But that script may be flipping. The ETH/BTC pair is perking up, printing a breakout structure that mirrors early May setup. Over the last four sessions, the ratio has climbed close to 6%, while Bitcoin has dropped 5.05% on the week. Ethereum, on the other hand, has only slipped 1.06%, showing notable relative strength. According to AMBCrypto, it is the kind of setup that often front-runs a rotation play. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) Case in point: Back in early May, ETH broke free from a sluggish range and ripped 50% higher in under a week, while Bitcoin chopped sideways near $103k. As May comes to a close, Bitcoin is once again caught in a tight trading range, potentially setting the stage for Ethereum to capitalize on its relative strength. Ethereum’s divergence from Bitcoin wasn’t a coincidence. Instead, it’s backed by some serious flow action. On the 29th of May, while BTC ETFs hemorrhaged nearly $340 million in outflows, Ethereum ETFs raked in a solid $91.9 million. Fidelity and Bitwise both saw fresh inflows, bucking the trend set by Bitcoin’s heavy BlackRock IBIT ETF-driven inflows. Meanwhile, whales (holding 1,000+ ETH) are loading up fast over the past four days, perfectly syncing their moves with Bitcoin’s recent slump. Source: Glassnode On both the charts and the chain, Ethereum looks primed to capitalize on another rotation window, setting the stage for a potential mega rally against BTC’s volatility. As Q2 wraps up, with ETH historically outpacing BTC by a wide margin, all eyes should stay locked on Ethereum, as it looks like it’s gearing up to deliver more alpha for savvy investors.

Title: How Institutional Investors Are Ramping Up Climate Investments In 2025

ByMindy Lubber ByMindy Lubber, Contributor. In today’s investment landscape, large institutional investors are increasingly matching capital with a clean energy future. A recent Mercer Investment study of 74 large asset owners-- with more than $2 trillion in assets--found that 70% now integrate responsible investment goals into their strategies, a seven percentage jump from last year. Despite shifting rhetoric in some corners of the market, momentum continues to build. The Mercer study underscores this powerful trend—a growing majority are not only setting clear responsible investment goals, they’re also increasing how much they allocate to those investments. Responsible Investment Goals Now Central to Portfolio Strategy From New York to Oregon to Ontario, asset owners-- the investors that include pension funds, endowments, insurers, sovereign wealth funds, and wealth managers--are making clear that managing climate risk and seizing investment opportunities are central to long-term fiduciary duty. In 2025, that’s translating into investors pouring more capital into climate solutions at scale, reporting progress on portfolio emissions, and supporting public policies that enable a future-ready economy. Major Pension Funds Raise Expectations for Asset Managers Across North America, public officials and investment leaders are raising the bar for themselves-- and the asset managers they do business with. In April, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees the city’s pension funds, laid out clear transition plan expectations for investment managers. Asset managers working with the New York City Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Retirement System, and Board of Education Retirement System must deliver credible, detailed transition plans—or he would recommend putting those managers’ investment mandates out to bid. Highlighting the financial stakes for states and the public funds they manage, Maryland’s state comptroller released a report in April on how inaction on extreme weather issues is straining the state’s economy and budget. Economic impacts include workforce disruptions, agricultural losses, tourism declines, supply chain disruptions, infrastructure damage, and loss of essential services. And underscoring the critical role of policy advocacy in helping asset owners meet their fiduciary duty, Oregon State Treasurer Elizabeth Steiner backed state legislation introduced in January to strengthen the Treasury’s ability to manage risks. The bill supports the Treasury’s ability to pursue the near- and long-term investment strategies needed to reduce climate-related investment risks and protect the Oregon public employee retirement fund. Momentum is also strong north of the border. In February, a group of Canadian asset owners representing CAD 53 billion issued a call for the country’s financial institutions to stay committed to their net zero goals and to translate them into robust action plans--essential for maintaining a competitive and stable financial system. European Investors Reconsider U.S. Exposure The consequences of wavering on climate action are also becoming increasingly tangible. Major European investors are reassessing their exposure to U.S. asset managers amid concerns about declining policy certainty and a perceived erosion of leadership in the clean economy. Dutch pension fund PME, which manages €57 billion, is reviewing a €5 billion mandate with BlackRock following its exit from a key responsible investing group. Meanwhile, Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, noted last month that clients have “massively repositioned” to avoid U.S. markets, driven by unease over inconsistent clean economy policy signals and other geopolitical concerns. The message from institutional investors in 2025 is clear: climate strategy is foundational to fiduciary duty. As stewards of long-term capital, asset owners are not just adapting to a changing world; they’re shaping it.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 06/01 update below. This post was originally published on May 30 Bitcoin has fallen sharply since hitting an all-time high last week, down 6% despite the U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge bitcoin prediction. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last two years, turbo-charged by Wall Street adoption led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and then U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of the technology (with Elon Musk quietly plotting what could be a bitcoin price game-changer). Now, as fears swirl the U.S. dollar could be teetering on the verge of collapse, a serious BlackRock warning that quantum computing could pose an existential risk to bitcoin has been escalated by a Google research paper that found encryption-breaking quantum computers could be a lot closer than previously thought. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney wrote, referring to the number of quantum computer qubits needed to break a public-key encryption algorithm similar to that used by bitcoin. “If this is even remotely true, combined with everything else happening right now, the only safe trade are hard assets and, dare I say, gold,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya, a vocal supporter of bitcoin who claims to have first bought some when the bitcoin price was just $100, posted to X in response to the paper. 06/01 update: The bitcoin price has now plummeted by almost 10% from its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, falling to just over $103,000 and fast approaching the closely-watched $100,000 level. "Next week will be critical for both the crypto market," analysts with 10x Research led by Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note that suggested long-term bitcoin holders are beginning to sell. This coming week will see slew of economic and labor market data—topped by Friday’s monthly U.S. jobs report—as well as U.S. president Donald Trump’s controversial "big, beautiful" tax bill coming to the Senate and legal back-and-forth expected over Trump’s market-crashing barrage of global trade tariffs. Meanwhile, bullish bitcoin price analysts are predicting small changes in “sentiment” could trigger outsized market swings, with huge volumes of cash still sitting on the sidelines. “With roughly $7 trillion still parked in money market funds and another $2 trillion in fixed income ETFs, even a modest shift in risk sentiment could redirect meaningful capital into crypto and other high-beta assets,” Matt Mena, research strategist at crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) company 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “If bitcoin breaks out of the $105,000 to $110,000 range with conviction, we could see a sharp move to $120,000 and, more importantly, reach our previously year-end price target of $138,500 per bitcoin by the end of the summer.” Earlier this month, BlackRock quietly added a serious warning about quantum computing to the list of risks to its huge spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024. The fund now holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $70 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious “If quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock’s amended regulatory filing for its bitcoin fund read. The quantum computing risk to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, with tech giants including Google making strides in quantum computing research. “At this point, no blockchain is ready to withstand a quantum attack when this becomes possible, which could very well be much earlier than 2030,” David Carvalho, the chief executive of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure blockchain Naoris Protocol, said in earlier emailed comments that warned bitcoin is “sleepwalking into a disaster.”

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 30 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 30 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research.

Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 30 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks.

Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: 50% Downside For SNAP Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/05/30/50-downside-for-snap-stock/
Time Published: 2025-05-30T10:30:27Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. This photograph shows macaron pastries with the Snapchat logo during the inauguration of Snapchat ... More France headquarters in Paris on May 19, 2025. (Photo by JOEL SAGET / AFP) (Photo by JOEL SAGET/AFP via Getty Images) Snap (NYSE: SNAP) stock has fallen more than 20% this year. In fact, the stock has decreased over 50% from its peak in July of last year. It was trading at around $8 per share at the close of the market yesterday. This recent poor performance can be linked to the absence of second-quarter guidance, worries about how macroeconomic conditions are impacting advertising demand, and slower-than-expected revenue growth, particularly in key segments. The current question is – could it decline further—by another 25-30%? What if it drops to 50%, reaching $4 levels? Well, here’s the issue: even at about $8 per share, the stock isn’t inexpensive. It is valued at nearly 35 times its cash flow over the last twelve months. If we invert that figure, it results in a cash flow yield of roughly 2.9% (the ratio of cash flow to price). By comparison, Meta Platforms trades at just 17 times cash flow. Furthermore, Meta is a leader in social networking platforms and has consistently achieved 13% revenue growth over the past few years, in contrast to 9% for SNAP. Is a 35x multiple genuinely warranted for SNAP? What you are willing to pay is significant. We have developed the Trefis High Quality Portfolio with a focus on relative valuation. Notably, HQ has recorded over 91% return since its inception and has outperformed the S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow — all of them. Separately, see – Nvidia Stock’s 1 Big Risk Although Snap’s average revenue growth of 9% over the past three years is relatively modest, and its -13% net margins are inferior to most companies in the Trefis coverage universe, there's a crucial factor influencing its valuation. Snap has notably increased its user base, with daily active users rising from 319 million in 2021 to 460 million currently. This steady user growth has historically been rewarded by the market. The company's appeal to advertisers comes from its primary target audience: younger demographics (Gen Z and Millennials). These groups are particularly appealing due to their significant future spending potential and engagement with emerging trends, prompting investors to pay a premium for access to this valuable audience. While Snap may continue to grow its user base in the short term, the critical challenge lies in enhancing its Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). Failure to achieve this could result in a slowdown in revenue growth. Moreover, the company is currently not profitable, and the necessity to integrate AI into its offerings may further strain its already tight margins. As a result, Snap’s valuation should reflect that of companies experiencing 5-10% revenue growth, assuming it can even maintain that level. In stark contrast to Snap, Meta is a more stable, resilient, and deeply entrenched entity. Its dominance is “embedded” in the essential ways people socialize, communicate, and consume digital content. Meta currently trades at about 17 times cash flow while delivering 13% annual growth. If Snap were valued at a comparable 17x cash flow multiple, its share price would drop to around $4, representing another 50% decline. Could Snap’s multiple even fall below the 17x commanded by Meta? Ultimately, the choice of how much you are ready to pay for SNAP is up to you. Snap’s dependence on digital advertising, especially from sectors like consumer goods, entertainment, retail, and tech services, offers a potential silver lining. There’s always the chance that advertising expenditures will recover. Historically, when economic conditions improve and consumer confidence rises, marketing budgets are among the first to expand. This occurs because companies typically increase advertising spending when they’re optimistic about future sales growth, planning new product launches, or actively competing for market share. If advertising activities and volumes increase, Snap’s revenues are likely to follow. There’s considerable pent-up demand from brands that scaled back their advertising efforts during recent economic uncertainty. Importantly, Snap may not need to significantly elevate its ad prices; it mainly requires a boost in advertiser activity to drive its revenue growth. Comparing SNAP with Meta is essential for understanding the risk-reward profile of investing in Snap. Effective investment decisions rely on gauging relative attractiveness. The central question is: should you invest in SNAP stock, maintain interest-earning cash to avoid market risk, or perhaps choose an S&P 500 ETF? How much higher is the expected return on SNAP stock compared to cash, and what downside risk must be accepted for that potential gain? Utilizing a specific “anchor” asset like Meta Platforms provides a strong framework for assessing this risk-reward dynamic. Note: Choose comparisons wisely. SNAP is currently a “high valuation” stock. When a company trades at around 35x Price-to-Free Cash Flow (P/FCF), anchoring it against Meta offers essential perspective. Meta, with more reasonable multiples, often makes a more compelling investment case than Snap. Regardless of the trade-off, investing in a single stock can be risky. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500over the last 4 years. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the standard index, with a more stable performance observable in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: How Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk fell behind Eli Lilly in the weight loss drug race
URL: https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-eli-lilly-ozempic-zepbound-weight-loss-1851782626
Time Published: 2025-05-30T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO) makes Ozempic, the best-known GLP-1 drug out today. And until quite recently, the Danish pharma giant consistently led the pack in new prescriptions, becoming virtually synonymous with a booming weight loss drug market that could hit $139 billion by 2030. But things have soured since Novo Nordisk stock hit an all-time high last summer. The company has struggled to meet surging demand, ceding ground to both its Big Pharma rival Eli Lilly (LLY), and to smaller firms making compounded versions of weight loss drugs. Its pipeline of next-generation weight loss drugs has underwhelmed. And after the stock fell 50% in a year, Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen resigned earlier this month. So why is the maker of blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs that defined a new market now stuck chasing Eli Lilly? Analysts say the rise of Eli Lilly’s Ozempic competitor Zepbound is just one facet in Novo Nordisk’s struggle to keep pace with its biggest rival. In fact, the market’s transformation is just getting started. Novo Nordisk launched its injectable GLP-1 semaglutide as Ozempic for diabetes in 2018 and Wegovy for weight loss in 2021. While these drugs followed Eli Lilly’s Byetta (2005) and Novo Nordisk’s Saxenda (2014), the hype around GLP-1s didn’t really pick up until 2022, when celebrity weight loss stories, TikTok influencers, and even Elon Musk helped make Ozempic a household name. Around then, Eli Lilly launched tirzepatide — an injectable that targets both GLP-1 and GIP receptors — branding it as Mounjaro for diabetes (2022) and Zepbound for weight loss (2023). “The launch of Wegovy was probably the first issue that Novo ran into, because they really just couldn’t supply the market,” said Evan Seigerman, a managing director and senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets (BMO). He said the company “just didn’t fully understand what the demand for obesity medication was going to be.” Then, as its American rival “was really working hard to build up supply [in 2024], it seemed that Novo was kind of faltering a bit,” Seigerman said. Wegovy shortages made room in the market not just for Zepbound, but also for compounded knockoffs from Hims & Hers, Noom, and Ro under a temporary FDA allowance. But these telehealth companies only filled gaps in the market. They didn’t create them. “I know Novo talks about the impact of compounded semaglutide, but I really think it goes down to the supply issues that created a permanent shift in the market,” Seigerman said. He also noted that Zepbound patients lose more weight than Wegovy patients, as head-to-head studies show. Eli Lilly also seems more proactive about getting its marquee drug to priced-out patients. It started selling discounted Zepbound directly to consumers last August, targeting compounding patients and others without adequate insurance. Six months after Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk followed with its own direct-to-consumer push. In the first week of March, the number of new Zepbound prescriptions in the U.S. exceeded new Wegovy prescriptions for the first time, according to Reuters and clinical research firm IQVIA (IQV). It’s not just the rising Zepbound and Mounjaro prescriptions. Novo Nordisk’s pipeline is also raising concerns. In December, Novo Nordisk released key late-stage trial results for CagriSema, its next-generation weight loss drug that combines semaglutide and cagrilintide — the latter of which mimics the hormone amylin. Novo Nordisk said the treatment yielded 22.7% weight loss, missing its 25% forecast. Subsequent trial data disappointed investors in March. The December results “didn’t look like bad data on the top line,” said Karen Andersen, Morningstar’s (MORN) healthcare research director. “But it was a huge disappointment given that the market was anticipating Novo to be able to leapfrog Lilly.” Instead, Andersen said, Novo Nordisk delivered results that closely resembled existing GLP-1 drugs. Since then, Novo has seemingly been “playing catch-up in terms of trying to find a higher efficacy product [and] an oral to compete with Lilly’s orforglipron,” said Seigerman, the BMO Capital Markets analyst. Orforglipron is an experimental GLP-1 oral drug, and Eli Lilly said in April that it “demonstrated statistically significant efficacy results” in a Phase 3 diabetes trial. Investors await the pill’s Phase 3 trial results for obesity, which could come in the third quarter, Andersen said. The daily pill could be huge, in part because of it would boost GLP-1 accessibility for needle-shy patients. The big GLP-1 drugs on the market today require an injection via a pre-filled pen, or a syringe and single-use vial. A small-molecule oral drug such as orforglipron could be cheaper and faster to make, and “easier to scale,” Andersen said. Investors are also watching for late-stage trial data on a stronger Eli Lilly shot — retatrutide. The company thinks the experimental drug could outdo tirepizide by targeting GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors simultaneously. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk is doubling down on semaglutide — via Ozempic, Wegovy, CagriSema, and an oral version — rather than developing “something that’s truly novel,” Seigerman said. Novo Nordisk stock has dropped more than 50% since its peak of $146 per share last June. The stock has fallen 21% so far this year, to about $69 per share. Eli Lilly stock is only down about 6% this year amid broader market woes. Novo Nordisk has made some big moves recently. Earlier in May, it struck a deal with CVS (CVS) to make Wegovy Caremark’s preferred weight loss drug. Novo Nordisk also expects to benefit from a crackdown on compounded GLP-1s. Then Novo Nordisk abruptly ousted CEO of eight years, Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen. The move reportedly surprised Jørgensen. Analysts were also surprised. In announcing the leadership change, Novo Nordisk said it’s seeking a new CEO “in light of the recent market challenges” and the “development of the company’s share price since mid-2024.” Translation: The CEO behind Novo Nordisk’s wildly profitable bet on weight loss drugs got axed for ceding hype and market share to Eli Lilly. Yet even with its CEO headed for the door, Helge Lund, Novo’s board chair, said that “Novo Nordisk’s strategy remains unchanged as to the plans and initiatives we presented last week in connection with our first quarter financial announcement.” The message has analysts perplexed. “If the stock’s down 50% from your highs, how is that strategy working?” Seigerman said. “It might feel good to fire the CEO, but that doesn’t solve the issues that are causing the performance of your stock.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Middle managers, beware: The Great Flattening layoff trend has moved beyond Big Tech and into retailers like Walmart
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-manager-layoffs-walmart-big-tech-great-flattening-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-30T07:49:02Z
Full Content:
It's a tough time to be a middle manager. Companies are looking for ways to cut costs, and mid-career employees' jobs are increasingly on the chopping block. Earlier this year, Big Tech giants like Google, Intel, and Amazon announced their plans to lay off thousands of workers, mostly managers. Last week, the trend hit Walmart, which said it will "remove layers and complexity" by reducing its labor force by 1,500 people, many of them in midlevel corporate roles. Retailer Wayfair also recently laid off managers, and some companies like fintech firm Block are moving managers into non-management roles. The latest manager purge is partially a symptom of a US economy rocked by recession fears and federal tariff whiplash. Several companies — including Walmart — have begun to raise prices because President Donald Trump's proposed levies are hiking their overhead costs. Reducing higher-paid, midlevel employees is another way for them to save money and streamline corporate bureaucracy. What's more, workplace efficiency is en vogue at the federal level, with Elon Musk and the White House's DOGE office spearheading a widespread staff reduction at government agencies. It's all adding up to 2025's "Great Flattening." Are you a middle manager? Please fill out this quick form, or contact this reporter via Signal at alliekelly.10; here's our guide to sharing information securely. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2023 alongside a bout of Meta layoffs that "flatter is faster." "I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work," he said. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy similarly said in 2024, "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today." Daniel Zhao, lead economist at the job-search platform Glassdoor, told Business Insider that this flattening isn't a random financial fluke, but the result of yearslong labor market trends. He said companies across industries opted for "rapid headcount growth" in the early pandemic years. To accommodate a slew of new hires, many of these companies needed more middle managers to train young talent. Zhao added that some companies were primed to "hand out promotions into the management ranks to attract and retain high performers during the labor shortages era" of the early 2020s. With recent hiring slowdowns, Zhao said that this inflated middle management tier is becoming less necessary. "When the economy shifts into a lower gear, companies start looking for where they can cut workforce costs, often looking at high-salaried managers," he said. "And as companies slow down hiring, the need for onboarding and training new workers diminishes." Despite this trend, the labor market is still strong on paper, and overall, layoffs are low. And, while "The Great Flattening" is ramping up, it also isn't new. Big Tech's layoffs of early- and mid-career workers have been happening on and off for years. Walmart's recent announcement signals that the strategy is gaining broader appeal. Gallup reported that overall employee engagement dropped to its lowest level in a decade last year, and Glassdoor's Employee Confidence Index shows that less than half of midlevel employees have a positive business outlook about their employers as of April, the lowest figure since the job-search platform began measuring employee confidence in 2016. Glassdoor data published in November also shows that laid-off middle managers often have to take lower-seniority or lower-salaried positions to break back into the workforce. Those who aren't laid off and remain managers could find themselves with an overwhelming amount of direct reports. BI has heard from over 750 Americans of all ages about their experiences with the job market. Some are boomeranging back to old employers, while others are left empty-handed despite hundreds of applications. Many job seekers have become so frustrated by rejections and ghosting that they're taking whatever roles they can find. Zhao said the flattening is likely to impact more than just managers. Each industry hit by layoffs could disrupt its traditional career ladder, especially for young people. As Zhao put it: "This trend also creates bunching down at the bottom of the career ladder as former managers compete for roles that traditionally would be opportunities for entry-level or experienced hires to move up the career ladder."

Title: Renovation of social home in Blackrock cost local council €200,000 to bring back into use
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/housing-planning/2025/05/29/blackrock-social-home-renovation-cost-council-200000/

Full Content:
Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council spent more than €200,000 bringing a vacant social home in Blackrock, south Dublin back into use last year. The local authority said it spent €503,142 on “three major refurbishment properties” to re-let in 2024. This included the property in Blackrock, which was built in 1957 and had the same tenant for 63 years. A unit in Glasthule, built in 1934 with the same tenant for 39 years, cost €146,414. The other property was in Dún Laoghaire, constructed in 1932, had same tenant for 49 years, and cost €138,581. “They were all major refurbishments due to the condition of the properties when they were handed back to the council,” a spokeswoman for the council said. “One required an existing extension to be demolished and rebuilt, all required works such as electrical rewiring upgrade works, energy upgrades works, insulation works, external roof works, full new kitchen installations and replastering of internal roofs and walls.” [ Intimidation in a Dublin suburb, and the derelict house being used as stablesOpens in new window ] The Department of Housing and Local Government said it is committed to supporting local authorities implementing an asset management ICT (information and communications technology) system to allow for “strategic and informed planned maintenance work programmes” supported by stock condition surveys. “This approach will ensure that homes are maintained on an ongoing basis and not only maintained at the time of vacancy in some cases after a significant period of time,” it said. “This will result in less works required on re-let, less costs associated and ensure homes are turned around as quick as possible.” The Programme for Government commits to introducing a new voids programme, to implement long-term strategic reforms and mandate local authorities to establish voids frameworks to improve the turnaround of vacant social housing units. However, the department said there is “no set time frame in place” for the new programme. Void is the term given to when tenants vacate houses or flats, either transferring to somewhere more suitable or leaving to purchase their own property. The death of a tenant or a marital breakdown can also result in a void unit. [ Elderly residents of Dublin 8 complex still feel ‘unsafe’ despite installation of security gateOpens in new window ] Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which covers Blackrock, Dundrum, Dún Laoghaire, Sandyford, Killiney, Shankill and Stillorgan, said it re-tenanted 111 properties last year as part of what it would consider to be “normal re-let processes”. The average cost per property was €31,190. “The length of time a property remains vacant depends on the condition of the property when it is returned to the council and the amount of information required to complete the allocation process,” it added. “Every effort is being made to ensure properties are tenanted as quickly as possible. In 2025, re-let works have been completed on 39 properties to date at an average cost of €17,580.” The council’s average re-let time for vacant properties in 2023 was 23 weeks. Dublin City Council said the average cost of refurbishing void units in 2024 was €44,000. It said when a unit becomes vacant it allows two weeks for tenants to remove any personal belongings, a 10- to 16-week period to revamp the property as well as a two-week period to allow a new tenant to inspect the property and move in. Fingal County Council said it refurbished and brought back into use 79 voids, excluding energy efficiency retrofit works, at a total cost of €1.7 million (or an average of €21,519 per unit). The average re-let period was 33 weeks. South Dublin County Council said it allocated 184 re-let properties at an average turnaround time of 20.64 weeks last year. Taoiseach Micheál Martin hit out at local authorities for the delay in releasing vacated properties to those on waiting lists in the Dáil last month. Mr Martin said local authorities take “too long to release a home that has been vacated”. “It can take sometimes months or a year for the local authority fill the same house again, and they cite all sorts of reasons, and it’s not good enough,” he said. “And now they’re looking for more and more grants to fill those voids.” He said those homes “should be filled fairly quickly, within a week or two of a house being vacated, unless there’s some structural issue” but added that the majority of cases did not involve structural issues.

It’s all change in Barna, where chef Nathan Hindmarch has a new diningroom to showcase his talents. With a menu inspired by the elements of land, sea and fire, a new open flame set-up works wonders in dishes such as black sole on the bone or dry-aged rib-eye with ramson capers. Long-serving sommelier Fergal Guiney is always happy to guide you through the wine list. Joanne Cronin With a bright, open room, big windows for people watching and outdoor seating for fine days, Caribou has already established itself as a fun spot in the middle of town for bar food that’s a cut above. Its steak frites with Irish rump steak and peppercorn sauce or double smash burger bring in the weekday lunch crowd, while hearty roast lunches with unlimited gravy fill the seats at weekends. JC Peking duck at China Tang – €88 for a whole duck, ordered in advance – arrives gleaming and is carved tableside by Mr Chan. The skin is brittle and amber – the first bite cracks, melts and disappears. Warm house-made pancakes, dark hoisin, sharp scallions and cool cucumber build the rest. The second course – wok-fried duck with cumin – is darker, crispier, and just as essential. Pricey, yes, but it is one of the best ducks you will eat in Dublin. Corinna Hardgrave [ Great places for sunny outdoor dining around DublinOpens in new window ] Cush recently relocated from the seaside village of Ballycotton to the busy town of Midleton, where Dan Guerin’s cooking remains as sharp and welcoming as ever. A strong focus on locally caught seafood remains at the heart of Cush, with John Dory, roast monkfish and smoked haddock all showcased on the menu. But fear not carnivores, there’s also hearty dry-aged beef chop roasted over charcoal or pork shoulder and mozzarella croquettes. JC A cool Australian coffee vibe in Liscannor. Elaine Slattery’s coffee shop offers a small, well-executed menu with daily baked goods such as brownies, cookies and scones, plus sandwiches made with local ingredients. Headed by coffee expert Richard Mattey, it’s a laid-back spot with a retractable roof, ideal for sunny afternoons or sheltered seating, and an upstairs studio for yoga and Pilates. CH Toulouse out front, La Rochelle in the kitchen – this narrow Ranelagh bistro from Colin Dapot and Sidjy Batista turns out deft French classics. Raclette-stuffed croquettes, pork in mustard sauce with buttery spaetzle, and a fish gratin show up on the short dinner menu from Wednesday to Sunday. By day, it’s a deli for coffee, croissants and charcuterie – with a smart wine list and retail bottles available with €10 corkage. CH Classic French bistro cooking arrived firmly in Dublin to great acclaim, courtesy of industry stalwarts John and Sandy Wyer. Located over M O’Brien’s pub, the L-shaped diningroom is home to a menu packed with Gallic delights. Start with home-made saucisson or seasonally perfect asparagus with cockles followed by chicken au vin jaune or steak frites with pepper sauce. Make sure, though, to leave room for the croissant pudding with Calvados caramel. JC [ ‘People don’t just want dinner – they want an occasion’: Restaurants share their secrets to survivalOpens in new window ] Dublin’s north inner city received a huge boost with the arrival of Joe Smith’s cooking, tucked inside the revitalised Juno pub. The menu is packed with good value downright tasty plates, influenced by Mediterranean flavours. Scoop up smoked cod taramasalata with home-made crisps, crunch through aubergine schnitzel or share a luxurious fish pie for two. Enjoy with one of their excellent cocktails or craft beers. JC Soup hot enough to scald your soul, dumplings fat enough to need a strategy, and French toast that should come with a defibrillator. Hong Kong Wonton is the Pau family’s 16-seater tribute to proper Hong Kong fast food: blisteringly fresh pork and prawn wontons, beef brisket falling apart into spiced broth, and deep-fried peanut butter sandwiches soaked in syrup. It’s a cha chaan teng (Hong Kong diner) drop-kicked into Dublin, serving serious food without apology. CH From former Locks restaurant to new kid on the block, Lena’s transition has been utterly seamless. The old bar is gone, replaced with a sleek new counter, the diningroom is better than ever and the menu is packed with chef Paul McNamara’s unmissable Italian dishes. Sourdough toast with melting lardo, the peppery pici cacio e pepe and the rich veal shin osso bucco will have you coming back for more. JC A Hong Kong native, chef Ben Wong came to Ireland at age 15 and now calls himself a proud Corkman. At Nosh 19, his menu is inspired by Hong Kong cha chaan teng cafe culture, mixing classic Irish-Chinese favourites with authentic Hong Kong and Asian dishes. Recent seafood showcase nights have been a hit, as are dishes like the roast duck noodle soup, Sichuan sour fish and Hong Kong ice milk tea. JC Reggie White could have stayed the guy who fixed everyone else’s pizza. Instead, he built the best one in Dublin – a sharp, low-waste pizzeria set in a reworked redbrick building in Rathmines. Behind a front window rattling with a 1981 Diosna mixer, he’s turning 48-hour fermented Wildfarmed sourdough into blistered, nutty bases topped with whey-braised leeks, Cashel Blue and Andarl Farm sausage. CH Tucked above Conway’s Bar in Blackrock, Sea Shanty is in a creaky-floored room where dinner drifts between anchovies sharpened with ponzu, grilled octopus on smoky muhammara, green curry and oysters straight from Woopstown, Cooley, and Killough Bay and battered seaweed bhajis. Uruguayan chef Sebastian Sainz and Spanish sommelier Elena Segura run the floor like it’s their front room, pouring serious natural wines to match the tide of sardine tins, tacos and tentacles. CH Jalisco and Oaxaca meet in Ranelagh as chefs Victor Lara and Celina Altamirano combine to bring elevated Mexican food to Dublin. Dishes such as Michelada oysters, tostada de ceviche, birria tacos with consommé and incredible charcoal grilled steak would not be out of place in Mexico City itself. It goes without saying that the cocktails made with imported tequila and mezcal are superb. JC The Bucks Head still looks like a Mournes hiking pub from the outside – pint, crisps, dog asleep under the table. Inside, Alex Greene (formerly of Michelin-starred Eipic, Pétrus, Claridge’s), and co-owner Bronagh McCormick are turning out Kilkeel scallops with beurre blanc, black crab and pork ravioli, and a black garlic bread-and-butter pudding that’s worth the drive alone. It’s serious cooking without the ego – a village inn where you can have steak and chips or savour some of the best sauces in Northern Ireland. CH Following a recent hiatus, the Pig’s Ear is back with a menu that is an ode to Irish literature and art. In other hands this would be twee, even touristy, but under owner Stephen McAllister the results are elevated and confident. Indulgent Dublin Lawyer omelette features whiskey flambéed lobster and Béarnaise sauce, holding true to its origin story of being “as rich as a Dublin lawyer”. JC Two restored carriages from the Orient Express, Leona (1927) and Linda (1954), at Glenlo Abbey, set the stage for a dining experience led by Angelo Vagiotis (Terre, Noma, Manresa) and pastry chef Linda Sergidou. The tasting menu combines exceptional technique with creativity: from organic leaves tied in a bouquet to Jerusalem artichoke paired with monkfish liver, and turbot in brioche butter with Champagne sauce. The pastry? Some of the best you’ll find. It’s clear – this is Michelin-level ambition, and one to watch. CH With summer on the way, Two Pups could not have picked a better time to launch its new evening food and wine offering. And while the name may be tongue-in-cheek, there is absolutely nothing pretentious about Adam Kelly’s food. It’s all bang on trend and beautifully executed, ranging from whipped cod’s roe on grilled sourdough and asparagus in Parmesan sauce and guanciale to chunky ham hock croquettes. Oh, and there’s wine now too. JC Vada is a daytime cafe that has livened up Stoneybatter with creative and fun dishes. Chef Hannah O’Donnell maintains a zero-waste philosophy as she serves up breakfast, lunch and weekend brunch. The Vada hash goes a step beyond with Ethersons gammon steak and asparagus, while the croissant French toast is for those with a sweet tooth. Look out for pop-up dinners with natural wines over the summer months. JC The Barrett family of Dunmore House Hotel know more than a thing or two about hospitality. Over the years, they have consistently developed and improved their little piece of heaven overlooking Clonakilty Bay. Under head chef Manuel Canapini, Adrift has become a contender for the country’s top seafood spots – trawler to table. JC It was all change last year at Aniar when owner JP McMahon commissioned architect Aidan Conway to create a new interior for this iconic Galway restaurant. Out went the lighter greens and neutral tones, making way for a darkened interior with dramatic lighting. It makes sense though, acting as a focus for McMahon’s dishes which have evolved into an intense, almost primal, expression of the west of Ireland. JC Baba’de may be the little sibling to Michelin-starred Dede, but this charming spot is standing firmly on its own two feet. Under chef Muslim Karafil, savour fragrant delights such as charcoal grilled chicken thighs with hazelnut satay sauce, spiced crispy chicken with brown butter dip, or a whole west Cork blue lobster with pil pil potato mousseline. Or come for Turkish-influenced brunch on weekends. JC At Ballyfin – a hotel so exclusive it barely seems real – Richard Picard-Edwards has delivered the final flourish: a Michelin star for the diningroom. The €145 eight-course tasting menu is on the familiar side of grandeur, with a thrillingly good Jerusalem artichoke cream topped with chicken jelly and gold leaf, and dishes featuring lobster and caviar. Broths, purées and reductions bring depth without being overwrought. Non-residents can book, but getting a table feels about as casual as applying for citizenship. CH Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix turns out sharp, confident cooking built on serious pedigree – Sam cooked at Ballyfin and Bath Priory – and produce from their own walled garden. The lunch menu and midweek Supper at Six are great value, but it’s at dinner that the kitchen really hits its stride, with a la carte and tasting menus (€80) delivering dishes such as seared scallops, honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion, pan-fried wild halibut with mussels, and slow-roast organic duck. CH The dark wood panelling of Ashford Castle’s George V diningroom might scream old-school but under executive head chef Liam Finnegan the food has taken a fresher turn. French-rooted, yes, but lighter, with sauces built on serious stocks rather than just butter and cream. Much of the produce now comes from a new two-acre kitchen garden, run by head gardener Alex Lavarde using no-dig methods and supplying everything from beets to honey. The twice-baked Hegarty’s cheese soufflé is a must; the wine cellar, as always, is formidable. CH It’s not every day a stonewalled cottage on the wild west coast lands a Michelin star, but Robbie McCauley’s precise cooking makes it feel inevitable. Along with his wife Sophie, he has transformed this former cafe into something rooted in tradition but unmistakably modern, serving a nine-course dinner (€125) and six-course lunch (€85). McCauley works tightly with local producers, using Burren outwintered beef, and lobster and crab from Michael O’Connell, they raise their own chickens and have an impressive vegetable garden. There’s even a small terrace for pre-dinner drinks – if the weather behaves. CH When Bryan Meehan – the Irish entrepreneur behind Blue Bottle Coffee – bought The Park Hotel from the Brennan brothers last year, two things changed in the diningroom. The tasting menu was dropped in favour of a focused a la carte, and Meehan hung two Sean Scully paintings – one of which gives the room its name, The Landline. Local chef James O’Sullivan keeps things classic but special with seared scallops, Kerry Hill lamb, and pan-seared sole. Non-residents can book. CH One of Dublin’s smallest restaurants and one of its mightiest, Liath is an intimate space where food is staged as art. Damien Grey and team perform manoeuvres with grace through service in the fully open kitchen, allowing guests to see the artists at work. Grey is looking to move to a larger space, so make sure to get a booking at Blackrock market before they leave. JC Chef Stevie McCarry recently won the Northern Ireland final of the Great British Menu, a well-earned accolade for this self-taught chef. With wife Rebekah, he has developed Lir into a truly exciting seafood restaurant. The Japanese konro grill is put to good use in the kitchen which turns out cod collar schnitzel, ling kofta with burnt apple sauce and smoked dogfish corndog. Look out for the upcoming summer music nights on the terrace. JC After more than 30 years in business, Denis Cotter is planning his transition away from his legendary fine-dining vegetarian restaurant. Long-term restaurant manager Dave O’Mahony is in line to take over, with head chef Miguel Frutos continuing to lead the kitchen into the future. With produce grown in a unique partnership with Gort na Náin farm and a super natural wine menu, Paradiso continues to set the standard. JC There isn’t another restaurant quite like Rare. Drawing on his classical French training, chef Meeran Manzoor has invented a cuisine that is all his own, using the best of local produce accented with flavours from his home city of Chennai. His menu descriptions may sound simple but they belie a complexity of spice and nuanced technique that is simply delightful. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin-starred Chestnut offers three routes – a €55 two-course prix fixe, a four-course for €75 or the full €120 tasting menu. Ingredients are local and fiercely seasonal – Lisheen Greens, Twomey’s butchers, Union Hall fish – with much of it cooked over a custom wood-fired grill. Expect wild halibut with mussels or aged Skeaghanore duck with coal onion and sour cherries. His food is exacting, mature and restrained – one of the country’s top chefs. CH Sitting in a little glen outside Ballyvaughan, Gregans Castle is the quirky but extremely stylish countryside hotel of dreams. Chef Jonathan Farrell moved from Dublin to take over the kitchens and is producing food perfectly harmonised with the stunning landscapes. Choose from dishes such as wild garlic spaetzle, Atlantic scallop with XO, butter-poached cod, roast rack of Burren lamb or forced rhubarb direct from the hotel garden. JC The Olde Glen bar would have a serious chance in any “Ireland’s most traditional pub” competition, and is worth a visit in its own right. But it’s the cooking of Ciaran Sweeney to the rear of the pub that brings the punters in night after night. The menu is packed with local produce including roast Mulroy Bay scallops, fermented potato bread with Gortahork cabbage and glazed Killybegs cod. JC Former Michelin-star chef Danni Barry keeps things razor sharp at the Owenmore Restaurant, with a four-course table d’hote menu (€95) that lets the ingredients do the talking. Kilkeel scallops with caramelised kohlrabi, line-caught mackerel with blood orange and horseradish, barbecued quail with soy and honey, and wild sea bass with salt-baked celeriac are cooked with precision. Bookings are available for non-residents. CH Five years ago Eunice Power opened her upmarket chipper in Dungarvan, setting a new benchmark for fish and chips by the sea. While the menu offers classic fish suppers, fish burgers and even fish tacos, there’s also chicken and beef burgers, plus a fish spice box for those feeling adventurous. The real standout? Eunice’s commitment to local produce, sourcing from a range of fishing boats in Cork and Waterford whenever possible. CH Morning starts strong with dosa, idli, vada, peserattu and uttappam, hammered out fast and hot with proper chai. By lunch, it’s birianis, thali platters and mutton fry, all packed with heat, spice and serious firepower. The original on Marlborough Street now has a second branch on Abbey Street – newer, just as sharp. The menu runs deep, from Gobi 65 and lamb Chettinadu to rich fish curry, and is built for repeat visits. CH Bart and Nicole Pawlukojc’s cafe runs an all-day brunch on one side of the street, with world flavours drawn from Poland, the Philippines and beyond, punched up by jars of pickles and ferments lined along the high counter. It swings from sharp, umami-rich plates to comforting classics, backed by natural wines and a sharp seasonal menu. Across the road, their bakery draws steady queues for award-winning sourdough, pastries and coffee. CH Dublin’s wine bar scene has exploded, but Bar Pez – Star Wine List Grand Prix winner – sets the standard. Manager Tommy Vivian runs the floor, while the 300+ list focuses on pet-nats, biodynamics and serious growers. Chris McCann (Volpe Nera) leads the kitchen, with Simone Tamilio (Allta) in rotation. Hake ceviche with rhubarb is cold and clean; boudin noir with Coolea rarebit is rich and exact; and scallop toast with plum chilli jam brings real heat. Open Sunday and Monday nights, it’s where chefs and sommeliers go when they’re off the clock. CH Enjoy a little taste of southern comfort cooking down on Cork’s own Bayou. Located in a gorgeous space on MacCurtain Street, start the day with a breakfast of coke and bourbon glazed ham with biscuits, eggs and fried potatoes. For lunch, try the New Orleans classics of po’boys, muffuletta, jambalaya or gumbo, finished with a powdery sweet beignet. In the words of head chef Joshua Crawford, this is non-fussy food, prepared well. JC Bearú in New Ross has a new look – a public square and outdoor seating ready for summer – but the kitchen stays tight. Breakfast and lunch run daily, with pastry from Claire Griffin. Dinner is Friday and Saturday only: a three-course a la carte with hand-rolled gnocchi, Kilmore Quay scallops and Wexford strawberries. Three choices per course, built around whatever the boats and farms bring in that week. CH Don’t be deceived by the apparent simplicity of Feast, the little village restaurant from Melissa McCabe, a former contestant on the Great British Menu, and Roisin McCaffrey. The devil is in the details, from the sleek ceramic coffee cups on wooden coasters to some truly innovative flavour combinations. Try the breakfast sausage roll with peanut butter and chilli jam, toasted sandwiches that pack a punch or an elegant creamy chowder. Feast is just as charming as Rostrevor itself. JC Always buzzing, Takashi Miyazaki‘s bistro and natural wine bar is the place to go for casual Japanese food. The Michelin star has been handed back, but it’s been replaced by fun and a whole lot of hand-pulled noodles. The creativity has never been higher, with plates such as grilled aubergine with red yuzu miso and chicken or udon noodles with white curry topped with creamy potato foam. JC Pillowy flatbreads, creamy hummus and smoky babaganoush are always a good bet at Izz, Alkarajeh and Eman Abu Rabi‘s superb Palestinian cafe. Fill up with manaeesh, a traditional topped flatbread, or swoon over the rich, showstopping magloubeh, a mix of rice, chicken and vegetable served upside down from the pot. Finish with flaky warbat filled with rose water cream and make sure to look out for their first cookbook, Jibrin, this summer. JC Jess and Dave Murphy opened their Galway restaurant in 2011, keeping it casual by day with a revolving lunch menu and shifting to a tighter, more serious dinner service at night. Dishes run to Connemara crab with kohlrabi and roe, lamb with asparagus, and agnolotti del plin stuffed with Connemara surf clams. Their Michelin Green Star reflects a serious commitment to local sourcing and sustainability, built around the circular economy rather than lip service. CH Still one of the best-loved Chinese restaurants in Dublin, this Sichuan stalwart just off O’Connell Street draws Chinese diners first, and everyone else second. Fresh dumplings, green beans with garlic and chilli, glossy aubergine, and deep-fried sea bass show a kitchen that has never lost its edge. Go with a gang – you’ll want to hit the menu properly – and there’s a private room upstairs if you need it. BYOB with €7 corkage keeps the tables packed. CH The little sibling to Good Day Deli, Nádúr occupies a charming small 18th-century building, with seating indoors and outdoors. The ethos here is sustainable plates, coffees and natural wines which celebrate the connection between the food and the natural world. Try Gort na Náin asparagus with burette on sourdough, Goatsbridge smoked trout smørrebrød or the chipotle béchamel and Hegarty’s cheddar toastie. JC Alain Morice runs a 20-seat deli, daytime bistro and wine bar, mixing French technique with Irish produce. The small menu changes weekly, with pâté en croûte – pork, fig and herbs wrapped in pastry – as a regular feature. Galway snails come drenched in garlic butter. Roast chicken with Dauphinoise is straightforward and serious. Desserts are made in-house by Morice’s sister, keeping it all tight and in the family. CH Conor Halpenny cooks with confidence and a sense of fun. Home-made crisps buried under a flurry of cheese, a warm Coolea biscuit with whipped ricotta and walnuts, and lamb mince on toast with cucumber and mint set things off fast. The Square “KFC” and trofie pasta with courgette and Boyne Valley Bán cheese keep the mood lively. Bigger plates follow – slow roast lamb, sirloin steak, monkfish with pickled mussels – backed by a tight, thoughtful wine list. CH St Francis Provisions shines all year around, but with summer on the way, everything truly bursts into life in Kinsale. Chef Rebeca Recarey Sanchez’s plates are deceptive, packed with flavours that are bigger than the cosy little room. Grilled ox tongue, cod with confit peppers or salty gildas, everything is magical, especially when paired with one of their excellent pet-nat wines. JC David O’Halloran and Martin Buckley – better known as “the lads from The Lifeboat” – bought their Courtmacsherry pub in 2017 and became a low-key TikTok sensation documenting the renovation. Now Martin’s cooking videos are getting a following too. The food is sharp but unfussy, with a focus on locally landed fish and seafood through the summer. Prime tables sit across the road with views over the river Arigideen. CH Set in the former O’Brien’s Pub building, which was subsequently home to The Chop House, this is now a serious diningroom with a long counter for walk-ins and a smaller room at the back. The menu sticks to local and seasonal produce – seafood chowder, deep-fried calamari, pan-fried halibut with leek and mussel sauce, duck leg confit with spring onion champ and buttered carrots. There’s also an 18-seat garden terrace – uncovered, unheated, and fully weather dependent. CH When the sun is shining there is no better place to be than outdoors at Fisk with a selection of their original seafood dishes lined up in front of you and a cold drink in hand. Think gochujang glazed trout, buttery brioche roll stuffed with prawn cocktail or spicy Bloody Mary topped with oyster and shrimp. It turns out that chef Tony Davidson is also rather handy with Mexican food too, so dig in. JC A Green Egg barbecue runs hot here, chargrilling vegetables such as asparagus for brunch, served under a heated 80-seat yurt-style tent. Rose O’Toole (formerly of Misunderstood Heron, Aimsir) runs the kitchen, serving up Irish crab and smoked black pudding benedict, Doyle’s sausage brunch burger and house-made sourdough with romesco. The wood-fired oven slow-cooks meats for sandwiches and will fire up again for Grangecon Kitchen pizzas on summer weekends. Sunday pop-ups offer a set menu (€45-€55) built around local produce. CH It’s a bit of a drive to Helen’s Bar, but the reward is a table outside overlooking Kenmare Bay – boats bobbing below, mountains stacked behind. The menu keeps it simple: bowls of mussels, plates of crab claws, fresh fish pulled from the bay and straight on to the plate. Good value, easy-going service and seafood that repays the detour in full. CH Lobster grilled with garlic butter and chips sets the tone here, backed by wild Irish fish and chips, mussels with cream, garlic and white wine and crab claws caught aboard the Atlantic Freedom, served swimming in garlic butter. There’s also wild Irish smoked ling – “smokies” – baked with crème fraîche. A heated terrace with a permanent roof and three beach huts makes outdoor eating possible whatever the weather. CH In Clifden’s former post office, Michael and Hannah Nagle serve a seafood menu that gets straight to the point. Fish and chips (€21), half lobster and chips (€28), mussels with sourdough (€15), and crab claws (€16) are the backbone, while daily specials like mackerel with apple and cucumber (€12) keep things fresh. The live-fire konro grill adds a smoky edge, and outdoor seating with heaters and blankets makes it a great spot, rain or shine. Larger groups can book a two-set menu (€30-€65). CH Diarmuid Ó Mathúna runs one of the best daytime spots around – breakfast, brunch and lunch built on proper seasonal produce. The taco with deep-fried Ros an Mhíl haddock, Aran Islands crab salad with Velvet Cloud yoghurt, and the toastie with Feeney’s pulled bacon collar are all worth the trip. Outside, there’s now a 40-seat garden, half covered, backed by 22 solar panels. They even make their own condiments, from honey mustard mayo to berry compote. CH Casual by day with small plates and sandwiches, more focused at night, William Browne’s Blackrock spot has James Strathern (ex-Dede, Orwell Road, Roe Wines) in the kitchen. There’s a short a la carte and a six-course tasting menu at €64. Cod and nduja arancini, red mullet crudo, wild garlic gnocchi and sausage and ricotta ravioli keep it tight. A sea-view heated deck with 12 uncovered seats makes the most of the setting. DJ nights and summer events are planned. CH Keith Coleman – formerly of Roots, Fumbally and Fia – is behind some of the best casual food in Dublin. The evening menu runs Thursday to Saturday: roast Iona Farm carrots with labneh and chermoula, cauliflower with smoky cashew sauce, free-range chicken thigh with tzatziki and hot honey. The sheltered 42-seat garden, planted and properly thought through, is one of the best places in the city to sit and eat when the weather behaves. A new bakery and test kitchen are on the way later this year. CH In a restored 1820s coach house, Ciaran Kiely (ex-Oliveto) is cooking over a bespoke ember pit, working with Ballincarey Organic Farm, An Tairseach and Higgins butchers. The menu runs from Sheelagh’s beetroot with St Tola’s goat’s cheese to Kilmore Quay monkfish, pork belly, and a Wagyu cheeseburger that means business. Outside, a 40-seat terrace – half covered, marble tables, wood stove and heaters – makes outdoor eating worth a gamble. Thursday nights run a two- or three-course neighbourhood menu. CH Situated on Cork’s historic Cornmarket, David Devereaux and Anne Zagar’s small restaurant has become known in the city for exacting classic cooking executed with local ingredients on a seasonal menu that changes weekly. Start with Anne’s home-made brown bread and burned onion butter, followed by unctuous duck liver parfait with spring Cork asparagus, anchovy and crispy egg followed by monkfish grilled on the bone finished with ‘nduja cream. JC Bastible continues to stand proud on Dublin’s Leonard’s Corner, serving its unique Irish take on Nordic-style cuisine. Under owner Barry Fitzgerald and chef Killian Walsh, the clean, crisp cooking is sprinkled with rich notes. Think crab tartlet with fermented sweetcorn and tart grape juice, grilled sika deer with the glossiest port jus or a creamy mushroom custard made with mushrooms grown right across the road. JC When most Michelin-starred places are heading for three figures before you’ve ordered a drink, this one still turns out three courses at lunch and early-bird for €50. Garrett Byrne’s food is rooted in the classics – ravioli of hand-dived scallop with fennel butter sauce, pancetta royale of Challans duck with spiced greengage purée, grilled octopus with braised chickpeas, Hereford beef with ox cheek croquette and green peppercorn salsa. Great ingredients, great cooking, great value. CH You don’t expect one of the country’s best set menus to come out of a 15th-century building in Waterford, but Peter Everett cooks with precision and care. Lunch is €38, pre-theatre €41, dinner €55 – for proper dishes like soft-boiled free-range egg with toasted brioche and cheese and onion cream, Wexford scallops with lentils and garlic sausage, and fillet of hake with smoked bacon, cabbage and potato. Eight outdoor seats sit under an awning, with heaters primed for Irish summers. CH At Lignum, Danny Africano leads a kitchen where every plate passes over kiln-dried birch, ash and oak, threading smoke through some of the country’s most precise cooking, while his wife, Molly Keane, runs front of house. The €145, 10-course tasting menu has included Killary Fjord mussel and sea urchin flan, red mullet and gambero rosso pasta, and wild venison just barely kissed by flame. A €70 five-course lunch runs at weekends. The Michelin star finally landed in 2025 – three years later than it should have. CH Big windows flood Ox with light, but the real draw is Stephen Toman’s cooking – precise, inventive, and rooted in the seasons. Refurbished in 2023, the calm, understated room sets the stage for a kitchen quietly recognised as one of the sharpest on the island. Expect dishes like smoked Ballywalter veal with black garlic, or lobster brightened with broad beans and lemon grass, while Alain Kerloc’h’s smart wine pairings pull it all together. CH In case the name hasn’t already given the game away, a parrilla grill sits at the heart of this Ranelagh restaurant. From restaurateur Jules Mak and head chef Hector Ochoa, charcoal flavour is infused into as many dishes as possible, from grilled half chicken in arbol and habanero sauce to caramelised pineapple with pickled onion and tangy tajin. The margarita menu is absolutely banging, especially the Verdita. JC Fidelity Studio connects to Fidelity Bar through a slick interior door, making it easy to move between beers and bao. Sister 7 – a Big Fan collaboration – serves Chinese-style tapas using Irish produce and ingredients repurposed from Whiplash Beer’s brewing waste. The dumplings and bao are solid, but the “lip sticks” – fried cakes of fermented rice, yam, tofu and celeriac – are the move. Don’t miss the Sichuan-style Irish lamb with cumin, chilli, sesame and curried chickpea popcorn. DJs keep the place buzzing. CH Laser sharp classical cooking, intense glossy sauces and innovative flavours all combined this year to land a first Michelin Star for the beautiful Morrison Room. It has been achieved under the leadership of local man Adam Nevin, who learned his craft at spots such as The Hand and Flowers in Buckinghamshire and The Grill at the Dorchester in London. Expect much, much more from this modest, immensely talented chef. JC When Gwen McGrath and Ken Doherty recently announced the reopening of Dublin’s smallest restaurant, there was much rejoicing. This time out they accept bookings, much to the relief of those who struggled to get tables before, and there’s also wine to accompany lunch. Small sharing plates of smoky aubergine, calf’s liver with fenugreek butter, and radicchio dressed with guanciale fat epitomise the eclectic Italian influence for which this cosy spot is much loved. JC Mickael Viljanen’s Chapter One isn’t just Ireland’s best restaurant – it’s one of the best anywhere, and not just for the two-Michelin-star, €90 three-course lunch. At a recent meal, a parade of canapés (warm mushroom beignet, pissaladière hidden in transparent pastry) was followed with Loire Valley asparagus, wild turbot, Anjou pigeon and razor-sharp desserts. Bookings open quarterly – next round June 24th at 9.30am for September–October. Tables for two go first; fours have more chance. Get on the waiting list now and sign up for the newsletter. CH Peter Hogan and Jumoke Akintola have stripped things back at their Victorian town house seafood spot in Tramore, now running a casual Fish & Chips Café on the ground floor. Light beer-battered fish – John Dory, haddock, whiting – leads the menu, backed by daily specials like Woodstown Bay oysters, Boatstrand crab salad and Roaring Water Bay mussel curry. It operates as a diningroom from Friday to Sunday. The wine list is as impressive as ever, and organic and biodynamic wines are poured by the glass, bottle or carafe. CH There are dishes at Goldie that make you want to eat nothing but seafood for the rest of your life. Aisling Moore’s creativity seems to know no bounds, creating pâté made from local meaty Rossmore oysters, Mexican-inspired pibil monk cheek sope or pan-fried megrim with cafe de Paris butter. There are generous mounds of crushed colcannon for sides and a modern wine selection available by the glass, carafe or bottle. JC Grano is one of Dublin’s hardest reservations to secure, but it’s worth it if you want pasta excellence. All pasta is made fresh every day, using flour from an ancient Italian grain grown by owner Roberto Mungo himself. New additions to the menu include cappellacci stuffed with slow-cooked beef and onion, romanesco artichoke ravioli, and spaghetti with asparagus, saltwort and Calabrian chilli breadcrumbs. Ask for recommendations from the all-Italian wine list. JC When a meal starts with a chunk of potato focaccia, carbonara butter and guanciale, you might justifiably feel that you’re in good hands. At Kicky’s, chef Eric Matthews and team will take you through a spectrum from refined to indulgent. Think mussels bound lightly in taramasalata with smoked eel and kohlrabi, wild brill cooked over charcoal or rabbit Bolognese. Make sure to finish with Audrey Cahatol’s signature Irish Coffee dessert. JC Kevin Burke’s restaurant is one of Dublin’s toughest reservations, and for good reason. The room fizzes with energy and the food is smart, focused and inventive. The choux with horseradish and Cantabrian anchovy has been there since day one. Small plates include marinated peppers with salsa verde and kohlrabi, followed by a tranche of turbot with jus gras, sorrel and Béarnaise. The wine list, put together by ace sommelier and restaurant manager Ann-Marie Duignam, is just as sharp. Book via their website – and if only 5pm shows, email for cancellations. CH Variety Jones has finally settled into its new home at the junction of Thomas Street and Francis Street. The attractive high windows allow passersby to gaze in at the kitchen and chef Keelan Higgs at the pass. This is exactly what a neighbourhood Michelin restaurant should be, with a tasting menu that combines comfort and fine dining. The old premises a few doors down will reopen soon as a wine bar. JC Always evolving, Niall Davidson’s allta is returning to a tasting menu format for lunchtime and dinner which is designed to showcase the restaurant’s journey over the years from Library Place, Setanta Street and now the Dublin docklands. With an unwavering commitment to Irish produce in the main restaurant and the buzzy allta bar, the punchy wood-fired cooking is well worth the trip. JC Ever since reopening, Coppinger has captured the buzzy and fun vibes of the original venue. Listen to the cocktails shaking while you browse the Mediterranean-inspired menu which uses the best of Irish ingredients over a barbecue grill. Everything is delicious, especially when it’s the incredible value “menú del día,” available Wednesday-Friday, which offers two courses for €15 or three for €20. Where else would you get it? JC Small plates, bigger tables, better chairs – Daróg in Galway has sharpened up without losing its edge. The cooking leans into smoke and charcoal, from grilled white asparagus with lovage hollandaise to dry-aged lamb with confit leek and swede. There’s a five-course tasting menu at €55, or you can build your own from the blackboard, where more than 40 wines by the glass change weekly. Run by Zsolt Lukács and Edel McMahon, with Attila Galambos on fire in the kitchen. CH There are two main features to the diningroom at Elbow Lane, the open charcoal grill right in the middle, and the stainless steel microbrewery tanks to the rear. Put simply, it’s all about the grilling and the beer here, although the cocktails are pretty damn good also. Start with the intensely flavoured pork belly with fish sauce caramel, followed by the signature slow-smoked baby back ribs or wood-grilled steaks. JC Flame-finished mains hold their own at this neighbourhood spot. Andarl Farm pork belly, crisped and tender, pairs with radicchio and hazelnuts, while monkfish is perfectly charred. For €29, the prix fixe (5–6pm Wed–Fri) offers a snack, main, and glass of wine – perfect pre-cinema. Otherwise, settle in for grilled lamb or free-range chicken, all cooked over live fire. CH At Mister S, they proudly state that all mains are cooked over charcoal and wood. But, to be honest, every piece of produce that enters the kitchen is in danger of finding itself over the glowing embers. The smell of smoke permeates the entire room and everything is delicious, from charred leeks with romesco and smoked mozzarella, to piri piri chicken, or their incredible beef sourced from Co Donegal. Everything gets a turn on the embers. JC Cooked over live fire on an Ox grill – tomahawk steaks, Black Angus chateaubriand, and porterhouse steaks are the stars, with pizzas from a full pizza oven and flatbreads to round it out. The recently renovated “secret garden” provides a relaxed outdoor setting. Set menus (€34.50 for two courses, €39.50 for three) make it easy to dive into fire-cooked flavours, while a revamped cocktail bar adds a finishing touch. CH The tomahawk for two (€79) is the headline at The Fern Grill – a slab of Hereford beef, carved at the table and kissed hard by the Basque Josper grill. Seamus Commons fires Black Angus, lamb and daily fish with the same precision, but nothing matches the depth and smoke of the beef. CH Flavour is at the heart of everything that chef patron Brian Murray does. Under Darren Kennedy, the kitchen turns out smoke-kissed plates built for sharing, using local seasonal ingredients. The signature milk buns with cultured butter are mandatory, then try grilled cuttlefish with leeks and smoked aioli, or lamb saddle and belly with smoked carrots. A second live-fire restaurant, Birdsong, is coming soon to the Coal Quay. JC Denis Vaughan runs this newly refurbished spot on the prom, firing meat and shellfish over a Spanish Josper to exacting effect. The menu is tight and fire-driven: barbecued Aran Island monkfish with a hazelnut crust, roasted chicken supreme with satay crust and fregola, and aged Irish Black Angus steaks with bone marrow butter, beef jus and dripping chips. It’s about proper fire cooking, heavy plates and the freshest fish he can lay his hands on. CH Walking from the busy Dublin quays into the diningroom at Achara, gently fragranced with the smell of grilled meats, is like being briefly transported far away. Chef Graeme Reynolds pulls no punches, delivering authentic Thai flavours such as chicken wings in fish sauce caramel, Wagyu basil chilli beef krapao and XO mushroom larb. Check out the €15 weekday lunch menu for some of the best value in town. JC Diningroom in Castlebar has been quietly serving one of the best-value prix fixe menus in the country since 2016. €42 or €59 gets you three courses and a sorbet – brown soda bread, scallops with Kelly’s black pudding, Hereford sirloin with gratin dauphinoise, and a sticky toffee pudding that justifies the drive. Service is calm, the room is dark wood and Prussian blue, and every plate feels thoroughly composed. CH The mark of a great wine bar is shown in how they share their enthusiasm for wine with their customers, and the charming L’Atitude 51 leads the way when it comes to a calendar packed with wine tastings and food and wine pairing events. The food menu is designed for sharing, with simplicity and quality shining through. Try Macroom burrata with olive oil, radishes with anchoïade or haddock and mussel croquettes, and of course, some magnificent wines. JC In a bustling neighbourhood, this spot still delivers a solid early evening menu – two/three courses for €42/€52 – proving that early bird doesn’t have to be bland. David O’Byrne, with his Michelin Bib Gourmand since 2018, keeps the menu fresh with creative dishes like grilled sea bass with orange and kohlrabi or pan-seared halibut with fennel, shellfish, and chorizo barley broth. A five-course tasting menu is also available on the first Tuesday of each month for €72. CH [ This just might be the best-value restaurant menu in the countryOpens in new window ] It’s all systems go in Dingle for the Flannery family who have increased the number of seats at The Fish Box as well as moving the takeaway to Paddy Bawn Brosnan’s. New this summer is Fish Outside of the Box, offering lobster, crab and prawn rolls along with cocktails, wine and beer. With fish direct from their own fishing vessel and commitment to a sustainable supply chain, it’s among the country’s top seafood spots. JC Darren D’Arcy always has a perfect bottle of wine on hand to match the dishes that flow from Barry Sun’s kitchen. It’s no easy task, given Barry’s broad range of skill and flavours. Think Flaggy Shore oysters with a dab of home-made chilli oil, his signature mushroom dumplings, BBQ brill for two or a classic rum baba with strawberries. It’s worth noting that the evening neighbourhood menu offers seriously good value. JC After 20 years in business, Dax still oozes quiet class. Graham Neville’s superb classical cooking is a joy – seared Castletownbere scallops with coral bisque, Tipperary beef, and a mille-feuille of Irish rhubarb are textbook examples. Owner Olivier Meisonnave has compiled one of the country’s great wine lists – from smart biodynamic finds to serious Grand Cru. CH Since opening, Killian Durkin and Jess D’Arcy have worked tirelessly to deliver wonderful hospitality and modern Irish cooking from their seaside restaurant. Killian uses local and Irish ingredients such as “lamb lobster” (lamb neck), Winetavern Farm pork and Howth honey to great effect. Don’t miss the iconic cod chip or their exquisite tarts. JC Recently refurbished, mrDeanes is a bistro-style restaurant that encapsulates the very best of chef Michael Deane’s 28 years in business, and this year received a Michelin Bib Gourmand. It’s exactly what a busy city bistro should be, serving up Portavogie crab on toast, entrecôte au poivre, sugar pit pork chops and fish and chips. Look out for their new own label white wine. JC Ruchii is a riot of Indian flavours and bright jewelled colours. Marinated jumbo prawns are cooked to perfection in the tandoor oven while the slow-cooked lamb shank nalli nihari is sheer warmth. Chef Sateesh Sayana also serves up authentic South Indian specialities including rava dosa, masala uttapam and a Sunday special of Hyderabadi chicken dum biryani. Read our full review here. JC John Coffey does not stand still but continues to develop, always cooking with flair. The focus here is on quality produce, resulting in a glossy golden pithivier of potato, onion and Mossfield cheddar; roast cod with cauliflower, capers and golden raisins or a dark chocolate and sesame ganache. JC The words “Asian fusion” can sometimes strike fear, but diners are in safe hands at Umi. Owners Seán Lafferty and Gary Moran have created a fun atmosphere that seamlessly marries great Irish produce with Japanese techniques. Think binchotan grilled steak or crispy dumplings made with local pork and a fiery rayu sauce. They even offer their own wine, a fresh Austrian Blaufränkisch made by ex-employee Jack Mcateer.

Full Content:
Connor recently starred in Warfare, which Garland co-directed. Garland (Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War) is set to direct and write the Elden Ring film at A24. Peter Rice is producing alongside Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich from DNA, with George R. R. Martin and Vince Gerardis also credited as producers.

Title: Apple falls behind Magnificent 7 rivals as its AI floundering hits stock

Update font size. Reset The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks have led the market’s recent boom. But as Big Tech motors into the AI future, Apple is dangerously behind and, so far, looks to have little hope of catching up any time soon. Shannon Carroll for Quartz: ‎ While the others — Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook parent Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla— race ahead thanks to leaps in AI and demand for data centers, Apple is stuck in reverse. Its share price is down about 18% so far this year, making it the worst-performing member of the Mag 7 — and a drag on the very tech rally it once helped drive. Once the most valuable company in the world, Apple’s market cap is now in third place, behind Microsoft and Nvidia. The message from Wall Street? Apple still matters, but it’s not setting the tone anymore. Apple’s Mag 7 peers have blazed new paths with AI in recent years. Microsoft has embedded generative AI into Office, Windows, and Azure — and is working on the next frontier, agentic AI. Google has rolled out Gemini across just about all of its products. Meta is pivoting from the metaverse to machine learning. Amazon has gone deep on infrastructure and developer tools through AWS to position itself as the AI enabler. Tesla has staked out a position at the forefront of embodied AI, from cars to robots. And Nvidia’s chips have become synonymous with the infrastructure powering the industry. Meanwhile, Apple, late last year, finally unveiled Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-driven features and a Siri revamp powered by ChatGPT. But Apple was late to the party, largely relied on a partner rather than a breakthrough, and has barely made a dent since. Rollout has been sluggish, features are still limited and easily found elsewhere, and Apple hasn’t announced much else. While Apple’s Mag 7 peers seem to be building the future, Apple is updating the present. It makes cyclical hardware updates, but they’re evolutionary, not revolutionary. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Again, as we’ve been saying for many years now, Apple is suffering a crisis of leadership and is paying the price for having visionless caretaker Tim Cook at the helm for far too long. Apple pays and has been paying John Giannandrea, Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, millions upon millions of dollars for years. WTF of any import does he really do? WTF of any import has he really delivered? Have you used Siri lately? Yup, it’s still a steaming pile of dogshit. Where’s Apple’s generative AI, John? “Too hard; too late; look for partners; gimme my paycheck and stock options.” AAPL shareholders need to start asking real questions of these executives, especially those who are supposedly in charge of Apple’s “AI Strategy,” when the company clearly has none. How about some accountability for once? – MacDailyNews, March 18, 2024 Apple was caught flat-footed, due to a lack of vision on the part of leadership… So, the only solution is to partner with a [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.] for the real GenAI stuff while pretending (marketing) really hard that some on-device AI Apple has whipped up in a few months is “insanely great Apple innovation” that’s at the heart of Apple’s 2024’s AI announcements when it’s really just an adjunct… Watch Apple make a big show of its on-device AI at WWDC and run many ads touting it from June onwards. Apple hopes to buy time for the data center buildouts and investments that will be required for them to someday own their own AI technology and not have to license it from the likes of [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.]. This is what happens after a decade plus with a caretaker CEO at the helm after he hits the last page of his iteration playbook, yet attempts to stay in the game for too long. – MacDailyNews, April 1, 2024 Clearly, Apple is not as innovative as it was under Steve Jobs who even started the company’s work on Apple Silicon, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro, but, thanks to Jobs and Cook’s subsequent management of iterations of products and services conceived during Jobs’ tenure, including the retail store buildout which is responsible for a significant portion of Apple’s growth, the company now has more than enough money to make up for Cook’s lack of vision. – MacDailyNews, April 23, 2024 The new “AI features” for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS to be revealed at WWDC is mainly a marketing exercise. The pressure is on Apple’s marketing team to position the company as an innovator in the space (“only Apple does so much on-device AI which enhances users’ privacy to ‘stunning’ effect,” etc.) that also makes “smart partnerships” with other AI companies (OpenAI, for example; even though it’s currently forced to partner if they want to offer any real GenAI features). Now, more than ever, finding themselves so far behind, Apple needs to sell, sell, sell! – MacDailyNews, May 28, 2024 When you’re caught flat-footed like Tim Cook’s Apple, you pop into scramble mode to try to catch up. Early on, you hit it with a big marketing flourish (WWDC24) in order to buy some more time. Then you dribble out features as they get finished and actually exist. Classic vaporware. – MadDailyNews, July 31, 2024 Executing a vaporware strategy is an unfortunate necessity without a visionary CEO and it takes time to actually realize (code, test, build out datacenter infrastructure, etc.) a grand marketing vision. – MacDailyNews, September 10, 2024 You know, some people get upset when we point out that Tim Cook is a boring, reactive caretaker who’s not really the best person to be running Apple today or for at least the past several years. Operations manager Cook should have been a 3-5 year stopgap after Steve Jobs’ untimely passing, running the iteration playbook, providing continuity for the company while it found a real CEO. Instead, he hung on — and keeps hanging on — well past his sell-by date. Sigh. You can be upset with us for having the temerity to call it like we see it, but the fact remains that Apple would be doing significantly better today with a visionary who’d have seen AI on the horizon, who’d have recognized the intrinsic importance of Siri and therefore invested in it instead of criminally neglecting it, and who wouldn’t have squandered the company’s gigantic leads in things like personal assistants and podcasting. – MacDailyNews, August 22, 2024 Until it gets another visionary leader (fingers crossed; Apple’s history has shown – cough, Sculley, Spindler, cough – that the next CEO could be far, far worse than the very competent caretaker Cook), Apple can afford to miss things like generative AI – which they clearly did – and then use its huge war chest to catch up – which they’re doing right now (fun times and 80-hour weeks inside Apple Park!) – and, hopefully, [someday] surpass rivals (or at least be as good). Apple will very likely unveil their catch-up work within months (this June at WWDC 2024) in iPhones (and iPads, Apple Watches, etc.) with built-in on-device generative AI and other new AI-driven features. – MacDailyNews, February 14, 2024 Apple needed new blood years ago, but the old blood simply won’t let go. – MacDailyNews, January 22, 2025 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Another sign of strength; show solid concern for the planet by announcing the company-wide carbon neutrality date will be moved up a year to 2029 (even if December). Maybe some banjo playing by some of the C’s during June’s WWDC? Here’s my guess: Apple is developing their own AI GPU to rival, replace, or mitigate the need for NVIDIA. It’ll take 3-5 years to get there and everyone is holding their breath hoping they can get there before AI goes post singularity and the race is lost. You make a good point there, Jobs always wanted apple to make the whole widget hence the migration from intel to their own version of the ARM architecture and their acquisition of Intel’s modem project. I also think that the importance of AI is overrated. I remember when I would try to keep track of all the stupid answers Siri gave me. That was five years ago, and it hasn’t changed yet. And it hasn’t changed yet. The jury is still out on how much of a money maker AI will be. For now it’s an add-on to most of these products, from the MS Office suite, to Google/Android/Samsung, to X to Meta Ray Bans, all of which I own, subscribe to or have tried. Do we have any hard numbers on AI subscriptions or how much it has boosted device sales? As far as I can tell NVIDIA has been the only clear winner as the seller of hardware that enables AI that POTENTIALLY will be a big deal but so far is still Silicon Valley hype. Super Grok is amazing and I’ve used it for research but it was already part of my X subscription. I don’t see average consumers flocking to this stuff aside from the free versions. Apple is of course way behind but they also aren’t only building commodified AI like its competitors. The main appeal of Apple is a Siri that can work within Apple’s ecosystem, no one else’s AI will ever have access to the coveted Apple user data and no one else has premium consumer hardware to sell the AI on like Apple does. Even this OpenAI, Jony Ive device is going to be tied to a smartphone (iPhone above all) and it will never be allowed to tell you what is coming up on your calendar or make plans based on your data no matter how sophisticated ChatGPT becomes. Apple could be the new Intel. Had it all and missed the next big thing. I do think a potential devise by Jony Ive for Open AI is a real threat to Apple. The fact that Apple can simply delay updates for a year and not think they could ultimately destroy the company is insane. The IO Device from Ives and Open Ai is NOT standalone … it relies on cellphones to be the core for their operation! Your email address will not be published.

Title: Where Will CrowdStrike Stock Be In 5 Years?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/where-will-crowdstrike-crwd-stock-be-in-5-years/
Time Published: 2025-05-29T19:37:43Z

ByNicolas Straut ByNicolas Straut, Contributor. While risks to Crowdstrike's growth do exist, the bull case for the stock seems more likely than the ... More bear case. CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: CRWD) is a dominant player in the cybersecurity market known for its cloud-based endpoint protection and threat intelligence solutions. Investors have been impressed with CrowdStrike’s past growth and are curious about its longer-term prospects both as a company and a stock. This article will explore how Crowdstrike is currently performing, how you can expect it to perform in the future, and whether CRWD will remain one of the best stocks for 2025. CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 in Austin, Texas by George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston, with Kurtz serving as the current CEO of the firm. CrowdStrike changed the cybersecurity game with the launch of its Falcon platform which is a cloud-native solution that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide real-time threat detection and response. CRWD is used across industries and institutions from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies to government agencies. The firm’s business model is based on subscriptions paid by its clients, providing reliable, recurring revenue. Clients can choose their security solutions from CrowdStrike’s offerings from cloud security to ID protection, providing a suite of offerings depending on the client’s industry and needs. As of May 28, 2025, the CRWD stock closed at $468.83 a share, marking a 34.98% growth year-to-date. This strong growth is based on CrowdStrike’s reporting that they delivered $224 million of net new revenue in Q4 2025 and an annual revenue of $3.95 billion for fiscal year 2025, a 29.39% growth from 2024. While CRWD experienced a GAAP net loss of $92.3 million, they reached a non-GAAP net income of $987.6 million. CrowdStrike’s future outlook is influenced by a number of key features including expansion into new markets, more demand from the digitization of business, and global growth. CrowdStrike has heavily invested in artificial intelligence and machine learning to better respond and neutralize threats. For example, the firm’s Charlotte AI combines intelligent automation and human cyber expertise to find and address threats swiftly. The global cybersecurity market is expected to reach over $504 billion in revenue by 2030 based on the increasing digitization of business and the need for solutions to protect from cyber threats. CRWD is expected to continue to profit greatly from this rising demand. With notable rising cybercrime committed by malicious state actors, political activists and other bad actors, organizations are investing more in cybersecurity to defend themselves. CrowdStrike provides expansive security and fast response capabilities to their clients from these attacks and is even more in demand to provide protection. CrowdStrike currently has contracts with the Department of Defense as well as other government agencies which provides stable income as well as legitimacy as a trusted cybersecurity provider. CrowdStrike has seen more adoption by small-to-medium sized businesses due to the launch of Falcon Go built for the needs of SMBs. This move provided diversification and expansion for the business. Analysts rate CRWD as a strong buy, according to TipRank’s ratings from 38 analysts. The average price target for the stock by April 2026 is $431.97. The highest forecast stands at $520 and the lowest forecast is $347. Both strong revenue growth and its dominance in the cybersecurity market are some of the key factors in the stock’s positive ratings. Year-to-date, CRWD has grown by 26% compared to the S&P 500’s mere 0.6% rise. The bullish scenario for CRWD is that the company continues to grow based on increasing demand for cybersecurity products and that its adoption of AI will continue to accelerate its dominance in the market. The firm’s bullish prospects also seem realistic given that Barclays raised their price target for the firm to $500 and the total addressable market for cybersecurity services continues to rise. A bearish scenario could be caused by expanding competition, failure of technology offerings, or worse execution in new markets. If a recession were to occur and affect CrowdStrike’s markets, their revenue growth could also stall. In this scenario, the $347 bear case could unfold. According to some analysts, CrowdStrike is expected to rise to over $1,000 a share based on their market expansion into new markets both nationally and globally. With rising demand for cybersecurity solutions, the total addressable market (TAM) for CrowdStrike offerings would rise as would their market penetration if their technology investments pay off and their reputation holds. This prediction is highly reasonable given their current share price, as of May 28th, 2025 at $468 per share and their growth over the last 5 years of over 433%. Bottom Line CrowdStrike’s innovation in the cybersecurity space with AI and ML investments, major clients including SalesForce and government agencies, and industry growth have all caused this growth stock to rocket in price over the last five years. With strong financial performance, increasing demand for cybersecurity services, and an expanding arsenal of tools for businesses and organizations, it’s realistic to recommend CRWD as a buy for 2025. While risks to CRWD’s growth do exist, the bull case for the stock seems more likely than the bear case. Is CrowdStrike A Good Long-term Investment? Yes, CrowdStrike is considered a good long-term investment because of its AI-led technology, strong revenue and market performance, and increasingly-necessary need for cybersecurity protection. What Is Driving CrowdStrike’s Growth? CrowdStrike’s growth is driven by the increase of cybersecurity threats, the company’s AI adoption, and their expansion into global markets and more industries. Does CrowdStrike Pay Dividends? No, CrowdStrike does not pay a dividend currently as it is a growth stock which reinvests profits for growth. What Are CrowdStrike’s Biggest Competitors? CrowdStrike’s primary competitors in the cybersecurity space are Cynet, SentinelOne, and Symantec.

Mae Anderson, Associated Press Mae Anderson, Associated Press Paul Harloff, Associated Press Paul Harloff, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply. Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can’t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits. The Associated Press’ CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30. Here are the key takeaways from the survey: The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year. CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong. The stock market’s main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%. “2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,” said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent “long-overdue” increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world’s richest countries still struggle to pay their bills. Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon’s shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023. Almost all of Smith’s pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted. READ MORE: Warren Buffett will remain Berkshire Hathaway chairman after Greg Abel takes over as CEO in 2026 Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospace ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards. The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar. “For CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,” said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. “Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.” Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is “that share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.” But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a “phenomenal rise” in CEO compensation “tracking recent years’ market performance,” which has “widened the pay gap within workplaces.” Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett’s compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla’s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle. Other notable CEOs didn’t meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks’ Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30. At half the companies in AP’s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company’s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018. The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald’s CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company’s median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries. Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included. “With CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,” Anderson said. “These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value – they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.” For the 27 women who made the AP survey — the highest number dating back to 2014 — median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts. The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks’ compensations was in the form of stock awards. Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million). Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs. “There are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we’re really not moving the needle significantly,” she said. Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson. Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023. Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.

Title: Nvidia's China problem is big. Just not big enough to stop it

Time Published: 2025-05-29T17:21:00Z

Most companies can’t shrug off an $8 billion loss. Then again, most companies aren’t Nvidia (NVDA). On Wednesday’s first-quarter earnings call, Wall Street zeroed in on Nvidia’s obvious weak spot: China. Thanks to U.S. export restrictions, Nvidia’s custom-built H20 chips, designed to skirt earlier rules, have essentially been made worthless. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress confirmed the damage: “Had the export controls not occurred, we would have had orders of about $8 billion for H20” in the quarter. That $8 billion is more than rival AMD’s (AMD) total quarterly revenue — and Nvidia seems ready to just shrug off the loss The tech giant reported another monster quarter: Revenue soared 69% year-over-year to $44.1 billion, while net income grew even faster. The stock popped more than 4.5% on Thursday, and Nvidia, with a $3.4 trillion market cap, is the most valuable company in the world — just ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) and now well ahead of Apple (AAPL). Nvidia’s data center business alone grew 73% year-over-year and brought in over $39 billion. And with its next-generation Blackwell chips ramping up, inference workloads scaling globally, and governments racing to build AI capacity using Nvidia infrastructure, China has become — if not an afterthought — then certainly just one node in a much larger empire. Nvidia has bigger chips to fry. “This is the start of a powerful new wave of growth,” CEO Jensen Huang said. Still, Nvidia isn’t abandoning China. According to a recent report, the company is designing a modified Blackwell AI chip specifically for the Chinese market that will comply with U.S. export restrictions. Huang didn’t confirm this directly — he said Nvidia doesn’t “have anything at the moment, but we’re considering it.” He did, however, address the broader implications. The question, he said, isn’t whether China will have AI — “it already does” — but whether one of the world’s largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Export controls, in his view, should “strengthen U.S. platforms, not drive half of the world’s AI talent to rivals.” Kress made the financial stakes clear: Nvidia expects a “meaningful decrease” in China data center revenue in the second quarter. Losing access to what it believes will be a $50 billion AI accelerator market would, she said, have “a material adverse impact” on the business and benefit rivals in China and beyond. As for the politics, Huang said that President Donald Trump “has a plan, and I respect it.” But the bigger picture is that Nvidia isn’t betting on any single market. It’s betting on a global AI infrastructure boom that’s only just getting started — what Huang called “sovereign AI.” The company’s strategy isn’t about selling to tech firms anymore. Entire countries could soon become Nvidia customers. “Nations are investing in AI infrastructure like they once did for electricity and internet,” Huang said. “Sovereign AI is a new growth engine for Nvidia.” “Every nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution, a new industry that produces intelligence and essential infrastructure for every economy,” he added. “Countries are racing to build national AI platforms to elevate their digital capabilities.” Nvidia’s recent moves show how seriously it’s playing this global game. At Computex, Huang announced Taiwan’s first AI factory, a collaboration with Foxconn (HNHPF) and the Taiwanese government. Shortly after, Huang was present as Sweden launched its inaugural national AI infrastructure. But perhaps most notable is Nvidia’s opportunity in the Middle East. Huang was there for Trump’s tour through the region, where the president announced a 500-megawatt AI infrastructure project in Saudi Arabia and a 5-gigawatt AI campus in the United Arab Emirates. Wedbush Securities analysts called it a “watershed moment” for Big Tech that could be a $1 trillion opportunity. Nvidia is positioned to capitalize on that global wave of AI infrastructure investment. As Huang said, this includes everything from powering cutting-edge training models to overhauling $500 billion of enterprise IT with its AI-ready systems. Add in industrial AI — robotic factories, digital twins, and more — and the company’s footprint keeps expanding. “Just about every country needs to build out AI infrastructure,” Huang said. “There are umpteenth AI factories being planned.” Behind all of this is a bigger technological shift — from generative AI to what comes next. “Reasoning AI really busted through,” Huang said, referring to AI agents that can make decisions, use tools, remember, and plan. “Reasoning AI agents require orders of magnitude more compute.” He added that the demand for AI reasoning is up, and “we would like to serve all of it, and I think we’re on track to serve most of it.” That shift — from model training to full life-cycle AI infrastructure — is fueling demand. Huang said Nvidia’s Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is “the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI.” And agentic AI, which takes reasoning a step further by acting autonomously, is making waves, too. “Enterprise AI is ready to take off,” Huang said. “Much more than generative AI, agentic AI is game-changing.” CFO Kress said the transition from generative to agentic AI will “transform every industry, every company, and country.” She said Nvidia envisions AI agents as a “digital workforce capable of handling tasks ranging from customer service to complex decision-making processes.” Huang said that Nvidia is in the “beginning of the build-out” — and that “there should be many, many more announcements in the future.” More AI means more chips. More chips need bigger clusters. Bigger clusters demand faster networking. And Nvidia is scaling every layer of that stack. Huang called Spectrum-X — the company’s AI-optimized Ethernet platform — “a home run,” noting that it added two major cloud providers in the past quarter. The platform can effectively turn $10 billion AI clusters into $14 billion ones through increased efficiency. And NVLink is also becoming foundational to the AI data center — it exceeded $1 billion in the April quarter. Now analysts see networking as a meaningful second leg of Nvidia’s AI infrastructure business. The U.S. export controls don’t appear to be going anywhere, especially as tense — and tech-heavy — trade talks between the U.S. and China continue. But Nvidia seems prepared for what’s ahead. The company just lost billions in China, and that might have been the least interesting thing about its quarter. As Nvidia continues to navigate a geopolitical minefield, it’s not that China doesn’t matter — it’s that everything else now matters more. As Huang said: “We’re off to the races.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Nvidia briefly returned to the top of the list of the world's most valuable companies when its stock soared in early trading Thursday following a strong first-quarter earnings report. Nvidia (NVDA) shares jumped more than 6% in early trading on Thursday, adding more than $200 billion to the company’s market value and pushing the company's market cap to $3.49 trillion, edging out Microsoft’s (MSFT) $3.41 trillion value. Nvidia stock gave up ground throughout the day, and Microsoft ultimately overtook the AI chip giant in market value by Thursday's close. Nvidia shares reacted on Thursday to a solid quarterly report on Wednesday afternoon. Nvidia reported record revenue in its fiscal first quarter as AI demand remained robust. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple (AAPL) have been jostling to be the world’s most valuable company for nearly a year. The three are the only companies to have ever achieved a market value of more than $3 trillion. Nvidia reached that milestone almost exactly a year ago, while Apple first closed at $3 trillion in June 2023 and Microsoft reached $3 trillion in January 2024. All three stocks have been hit to a certain degree by economic and trade uncertainty this year, but only Microsoft and Nvidia have shaken off the worst of it. Nvidia's and Microsoft's stocks are up about 5% and 9%, respectively, since the start of the year. Apple shares, meanwhile, are down about 20%, battered by President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs on China, where the company assembles the majority of its products, and insistence that it move production to America. Nvidia’s market cap, despite Thursday's gains, remains below its record of $3.66 trillion from earlier January when shares set their all-time high. Update—May 29, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest share price and market value data.

Title: Wolfe Research: “We Think The Pain Trade For NVIDIA Is Higher”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Now that the market has had a few hours to digest NVIDIA's earnings for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, the emerging view is coalescing around a distilled nugget of thought: NVIDIA was able to holistically address investor concerns, but the corresponding euphoria remains capped by the idiosyncratic factors inherent in the earnings report - the consensus estimates for various line items became irrelevant when some analysts chose to incorporate H20-related headwinds, while others did not, rendering the overall beat/miss computation an exercise in futility. Enough? - Nvidia $NVDA Earnings Recap Ultimately this report is a big mess because of mis-matched analyst estimates with the China inventory write-off. Tough to read much into the beats and misses below as a result. No blow ups but not overly bullish either. https://t.co/yFFf61ExcH pic.twitter.com/vpPIa4PAnL — Consensus Media (@ConsensusGurus) May 28, 2025 As a refresher, NVIDIA reported $44.06 billion in revenue for its fiscal Q1'26, beating the consensus estimate of $43.29 billion. Under the hood, however, its AI-critical data center revenue topped off at $39.1 billion, falling short of the $39.22 billion consensus estimate. In Q1, following the Trump administration's decision to impose licensing requirements on NVIDIA's China-specific H20 GPU, the company incurred $4.5 billion in charges related to inventory write-offs and purchase commitments, which then hammered the GPU giant's gross margin to 61 percent. On an adjusted basis, which often provides a clearer picture by removing one-time inflows and outflows, NVIDIA's gross margin topped off at 71.3 percent vs. the 78.9 percent figure that the company recorded in last year's comparable period. As far as guidance is concerned, NVIDIA now expects to record $45 billion in revenue for Q2, plus or minus 2 percent. The midpoint of this guidance fell short of the consensus estimate of $45.5 billion. Do note that NVIDIA's guidance for Q2 excluded ~$8 billion in H20-related sales. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Wolfe Research has now penned an interesting note, arguing that "the pain trade for NVIDIA is higher." Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso correctly points out that NVIDIA's Q1'26 earnings report was able to address "all investor concerns," which included "rack production, China (now out of numbers) and AI diffusion (not being enforced)." Caso also believes that NVIDIA's rate of rack shipments to customers is currently pushing ahead of its revenue run-rate, "and we would expect both to converge at some point." On the whole, the Wolfe Research analyst believes NVIDIA was under-owned heading into its Q1 earnings, which means that the pain trade remains in the bullish direction: "Net, we think the consensus view had been to own this stock for 2H and CY26, but the concerns heading into the report caused some to wait out this report. With the concerns now addressed, the stock up and a bullish outlook for 2H, we think the pain trade for NVDA is higher." Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Nvidia Revenues Up 69 Percent to $44.1 Billion

Nvidia reported a net income of $18.8 billion on revenues of $44.1 billion in the quarter ending April 27, 2025. Those figures represent gains of 26 percent and 69 percent, respectively, year-over-year (YOY), which is shocking when you consider that U.S. export rules preventing the company from selling some of its products in China went into effect during the quarter. “Our breakthrough Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer, a ‘thinking machine’ designed for reasoning, is now in full-scale production across system makers and cloud service providers,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said. “Global demand for Nvidia’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure, just like electricity and the internet, and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation.” Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday — and get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift! "*" indicates required fields Δ Thanks to the new U.S. export rules, Nvidia was hit with a $4.5 billion in charge in early April because of excess inventory and an inability to complete its obligations to customers in China. It sold $4.6 billion in H20 processor products in the quarter, but would have sold another $2.5 billion worth if it weren’t for the new restrictions. Nvidia saw $39.1 billion in revenues from its Data Center business in the quarter, a gain of 73 percent YOY. Gaming and AI PC revenues were $3.8 billion, a record, and up 42 percent YOY. Professional Visualization revenues were $509 million, up 19 percent. And Automotive and Robotics revenues hit $567 million, up 72 percent. Looking ahead, Nvidia expects revenues in the current quarter to be roughly $45 billion, about $8 billion less than would be the case without the China sales restrictions. But Nvidia’s stock price gained 5 percent, with U.S. Big Tech companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft expected to purchase a combined $345 billion in Nvidia hardware in 2025. Nvidia lashed out at the chaotic, nonsensical trade policies of the United States. “With half of the world’s AI researchers based [in China], the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally,” Mr. Huang said during the firm’s post-earnings conference call. “Shielding Chinese chip makers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad.” Paul Thurrott is an award-winning technology journalist and blogger with 30 years of industry experience and the author of 30 books.

Mae Anderson And Paul Harloff Associated Press Published: May 29, 2025 at 8:31 AM Updated: May 29, 2025 at 1:21 PM Mae Anderson And Paul Harloff Associated Press Invision FILE - Ted Sarandos arrives at the premiere of "The Electric State" on Monday, Feb. 24, 2025, at The Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File) NEW YORK – The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply. Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can’t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits. Recommended Videos The Associated Press’ CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30. Here are the key takeaways from the survey: A good year at the top The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year. CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong. The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%. “2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,” said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent “long-overdue” increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills. The top earners Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023. Almost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted. Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospace ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards. The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar. “For CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses," said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. "Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.” Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is “that share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about." But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a “phenomenal rise” in CEO compensation “tracking recent years' market performance,” which has "widened the pay gap within workplaces." Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla’s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle. Other notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30. The pay gap At half the companies in AP’s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company’s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018. The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries. Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included. “With CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,” Anderson said. "These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value – they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.” Some gains for female CEOs For the 27 women who made the AP survey — the highest number dating back to 2014 — median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts. The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards. Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million). Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs. “There are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we’re really not moving the needle significantly,” she said. Prioritizing security Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson. Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023. Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel. __ Reporters Matt Ott and Chris Rugaber in Washington contributed.

Administration News CMS Requests Hospitals' Data Related To Transgender Care In Children Hospitals will have to submit information on their policies and procedures as well as any adverse events related to gender-affirming procedures, The Hill reports. Plus, HHS has a new deputy general counsel to work on psychedelics policy, and news outlets list Medicaid's defenders. The Hill: CMS Demands Hospital Data About Gender-Affirming Care For Minors The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sent letters Wednesday to hospitals that provide transgender care services to children, demanding data on their quality standards and finances. CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz sent letters to “select hospitals,” giving them 30 days to provide specific information on “medical interventions for gender dysphoria in children.” (Choi, 5/28) The 19th: Where Anti-Trans State Bills Stand In 2025 Since 2020, every new year has brought a new record of state bills attempting to roll back transgender rights. Most of that legislation has not become law. Even as the sheer volume of bills continues to grow, LGBTQ+ advocates continue to defeat the majority of them. But each year, Republicans introduce more and more bills. And each year, those bills become broader and more extreme, as politicians look for new ways to enforce a binary definition of gender — and that escalation is turning up in the bills that do pass. (Rummler, 5/28) In federal hiring and cuts — Politico: A Psychedelics Hire At HHS A well-known drug-policy lawyer is joining the Department of Health and Human Services to work on psychedelics policy, according to two sources with knowledge of the move who requested anonymity because it hasn’t been announced yet, POLITICO’s Natalie Fertig reports. Matt Zorn ... has been involved in numerous cannabis and psychedelics cases over the years, including representing one of the parties selected to participate in the DEA’s administrative law hearings regarding the ongoing effort to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. (Schumaker, 5/28) KFF Health News: Language Service Cutbacks Raise Fear Of Medical Errors, Misdiagnoses, Deaths Health nonprofits and medical interpreters warn that federal cuts have eliminated dozens of positions in California for community workers who help non-English speakers sign up for insurance coverage and navigate the health care system. At the same time, people with limited English proficiency have scaled back their requests for language services, which health care advocates attribute in part to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and his executive order declaring English as the national language. (Sánchez and Orozco Rodriguez, 5/29) KFF Health News: Feds Chop Enforcement Staff And Halt Rules Meant To Curb Black Lung In Coal Miners In early April, President Donald Trump gathered dozens of hard-hat-clad coal miners around him in the White House East Room. He joked about arm-wrestling them and announced he was signing executive orders to boost coal production, “bringing back an industry that was abandoned,” and to “put the miners back to work.” Trump said he calls it “beautiful, clean” coal. “I tell my people never use the word ‘coal’ unless you put ‘beautiful, clean’ before it.” (Sisk, 5/29) Regarding Medicaid — The Hill: Josh Hawley Stakes Ground As Chief GOP Defender Of Medicaid Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is staking out his spot as a populist defender of Medicaid in opposition to the steep cuts contained in the House-passed megabill to fund President Trump’s domestic agenda. The senior senator from Missouri — who as the state’s attorney general once signed on to a lawsuit seeking to overturn the Affordable Care Act — has made his position clear: He will not support a bill that cuts Medicaid benefits. Hawley has long warned his party against Medicaid cuts; the $800 billion question is whether other senators will join him. (Weixel, 5/28) CBS News: Philadelphia Protesters Urge Sen. McCormick To Vote Against Medicaid Cutting Legislation A rally in Philadelphia Wednesday drew dozens of people to fight against proposed cuts to Medicaid. It's legislation that Republicans say will only go after wasteful spending and fraud. That legislation is now headed for the Senate. Wednesday's message was focused on the Republican senator from Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick, urging him to vote against legislation passed by the House that would cut an estimated $800 billion from Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for low-income Americans. The reductions would come from work requirements and other provisions. (Stahl and Nau, 5/28) North Carolina Health News: Medicaid Work Rule Could Burden N.C. Agencies The possibility of North Carolinians who depend on Medicaid being subject to a work requirement to keep their coverage has grown more plausible with the U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of a GOP-backed budget bill that includes the measure. Legislation approved by the U.S. House on May 22 would require “able-bodied” adults enrolled in Medicaid, which provides health insurance to more than 3 million people in North Carolina, to prove that they work, volunteer or attend school for at least 80 hours a month. (Baxley, 5/29) KFF Health News: A Medicaid Patient Had A Heart Attack While Traveling. He Owed Almost $78,000 On Christmas Day at the WaTiki indoor water park, Hans Wirt was getting winded from following his son up the stairs to the waterslides. Wirt’s breathing became more labored once they returned to the nearby hotel where they and Wirt’s girlfriend were staying while visiting family in Rapid City, South Dakota. (Zionts, 5/29) Global actions — MedPage Today: Germany Plans Global Alternative To PubMed On March 1, the world's largest database for biomedical literature -- PubMed -- went down, immediately causing a global panic that the nation's essential publishing resource was yet another casualty of the new administration's many budget cuts and executive orders. ... Though the outage was apparently just a glitch and PubMed was back up the next day, the pause in the ability to access published research prompted the fear that PubMed could disappear, and soon. ... Now that fear has spurred some to action, but not in the U.S. (Clark, 5/28) Axios: China Looks To Grow Its Influence Over WHO China is becoming a top donor country to WHO after promising this month that it'll make a $500 million gift over five years to the group. President Trump announced in January that he's pulling the United States out of WHO, leaving a power vacuum within the global health consortium that Beijing is trying to fill. (Goldman, 5/29) Also — CBS News: If These Items Are In Your Medicine Cabinet, It's Time To Throw Them Away. Here's How To Do It Safely While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration agrees taking expired medications carries certain health risks, the agency also recognizes, in some cases, "testing has shown that certain properly stored medical products can be used beyond their labeled expiration date if they retain their stability." ... The Cleveland Clinic suggests keeping a few things in mind if you are considering taking an expired medication, including the type of drug. "Taking some expired ibuprofen for a headache is probably OK. But using expired insulin for diabetes or nitroglycerin for angina is a different story," the clinic says. (Moniuszko, 5/28) CNN: Elon Musk Says His Time In The Trump Administration Has ‘Come To An End’ Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who was granted special government employee status to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, said Wednesday evening that his time in the Trump administration has come “to an end.” During his time helming DOGE, Musk oversaw major cuts to the federal workforce as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce federal spending. (Iyer and Blackburn, 5/28) Vaccines Health Experts, Industry Sound Alarm Over New Covid Vaccine Guidance News outlets unpack the public health effects of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s revised vaccine recommendations for children and pregnant women. In other vaccine news, HHS cancels its bird flu vaccine contract with Moderna; 'Hotel Influenza' will aid in developing new flu vaccines. CBS News: Health Experts Fear Potential Public Health Impacts From RFK Jr. Halting COVID Vaccine Recommendations For Kids, Pregnant Women Health experts are raising concerns about the potential public health impacts after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy announced the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is rolling back COVID-19 vaccination recommendations for kids and pregnant women. ... Kennedy called the latest move "common sense and good science", but some health experts said the restrictions could have some significant public health impacts. Chicago-area doctors call this change unscientific and "incorrect." (Price and Rezaei, 5/28) Becker's Hospital Review: COVID-19 Shot Guidance Change Draws Industry Scrutiny The CDC’s decision to remove COVID-19 vaccines from its recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women has sparked significant concern from healthcare industry groups. While some groups, like the American Hospital Association, took a more neutral stance, others scrutinized the move for bypassing the CDC’s expert advisory group and potentially threatening vaccine access and public health. (Bean, 5/28) NBC News: FDA Chief Says Pregnant Women Should Decide On Covid Vaccine With Doctors The Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, said Wednesday that the decision of whether a pregnant woman should get a Covid vaccine should come down to a conversation with her doctor — not a recommendation by the federal government. Makary took part in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s announcement Tuesday revoking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation that Covid shots should be offered to pregnant women and healthy children. (Lovelace Jr., Tsirkin and Sonnier, 5/28) The 19th: What The Latest COVID Vaccine Changes Mean For Pregnant People And Children Removing COVID vaccines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for pregnant people or children could impact the availability of the vaccines or if they are covered by insurance. Dr. Sean T. O’Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that removing the recommendation “could strip families of choice.” (Rodriguez and Kutz, 5/28) The Washington Post: CDC Blindsided As RFK Jr. Changes Vaccine Recommendations Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are scrambling to understand Kennedy’s decision, announced in a 58-second video on X on Tuesday morning, which took agency staff by surprise. Five hours later, CDC officials received a one-page “secretarial directive,” dated May 19 and signed by Kennedy, that contradicts some of what he said in his video, according to two current and one former health officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. (Sun, 5/28) Also — CNN: HHS Cancels $590 Million Contract With Moderna For Bird Flu Vaccine The US Department of Health and Human Services is terminating a contract with drugmaker Moderna to develop a vaccine to protect against bird flu amid the agency’s broader efforts to reevaluate therapies that use mRNA technology. (Dillinger, 5/28) St. Louis Public Radio: SLU Seeks Flu Test Subjects To Aid Vaccine Development Reservations are once again open at St. Louis University’s “Hotel Influenza,” where amenities include furnished rooms, daily nasal swabs and a special HVAC system that keeps the viruses infecting each guest from escaping beyond the sealed facility. This unusual arrangement is the university's Extended Stay Research Unit. Converted from a former hotel, the facility’s 24 rooms are reserved for test subjects willing to be infected with the flu for 10 days in exchange for about $3,500. (Wicentowski, 5/28) Health Industry Wait Times Up For Doc Appointments Across Many Specialties, Survey Finds A recent survey of six medical specialties in 15 U.S. metropolitan areas finds that the average wait time for physician appointments has increased significantly in recent years. Specialties most affected include OB-GYN and cardiology. MedPage Today: Wait Times For Physician Appointments Surged In Recent Years The average wait time for a physician appointment has dramatically increased in recent years, according to a new survey. Across six medical specialties in 15 large U.S. metropolitan areas, the average wait time for an appointment was 31 days, up 19% since the last survey in 2022 and up 48% since the first survey in 2004, according to AMN Healthcare's 2025 Survey of Physician Appointment Wait Times and Medicare and Medicaid Acceptance Rates. (Henderson, 5/28) Newsweek: US Shutting Nursing Facilities Despite Ageing Population The number of nursing facilities in the United States has declined sharply despite a rapid growth in the country's ageing population. More than 820 nursing facilities closed across the U.S. between 2015 and 2024, according to the hospital bed company Opera Beds. It revealed that 45 out of 51 states saw a reduction in nursing facilities despite a nationwide increase in the older population. (Cameron, 5/28) Fierce Healthcare: How Grow Therapy Hopes To Curb Patient Dropout During Referrals When providers work together, patients are more likely to get their needs met at the right place and the right time. This leads to better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs. In outpatient behavioral health, a certain subset of patients need intensive or specialized care. But referrals to higher levels of care are often inefficient and risk patients dropping out of treatment altogether. (Gliadkovskaya, 5/28) From the health care sector — Modern Healthcare: ChristianaCare To Run Operations At 5 Crozer Health Facilities ChristianaCare plans to assume operations of five Crozer Health outpatient facilities in Pennsylvania after submitting the highest bid of $50.3 million. The auction was held as Prospect Medical Holdings, Crozer's parent company, seeks to sell the system's assets after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January. The sale to Wilmington, Delaware-based ChristianaCare is subject to court approval, according to a Wednesday news release. (DeSilva, 5/28) Modern Healthcare: Cleveland Clinic Updates Outpatient Copay Policy After Backlash Cleveland Clinic is revamping an outpatient copay policy before it was scheduled to take effect, following concerns about disrupting care. Cleveland Clinic said earlier this month it would require copays for nonemergency outpatient services at or before appointment times starting June 1. If patients couldn't pay, their appointments would be canceled or rescheduled. However, the health system is backing away from that tactic and instead offering to set up 0% interest payment plans for patients to keep their appointments. (Hudson, 5/28) St. Louis Public Radio: Phelps Health Expands Ambulance Service For Rural Missouri Rural hospitals closing and population and traffic increasing along Interstate 44 are putting more pressure on the hospital in Rolla to handle growing patient loads, especially for emergency services. To meet those demands, Phelps Health has constructed an $8 million EMS base that will put its ambulance and helicopter crews in the same facility and allow for expansion in the coming years.

(Ahl, 5/28) Modern Healthcare: HarmonyCares' Matt Chance Bets On CMS' In-Home Primary Care Push HarmonyCares CEO Matt Chance said companies moving primary care into the home are in the right place at the right time as the Trump administration looks to rein in healthcare costs. The Troy, Michigan-based company delivers home-based primary care to people with complex conditions through value-based care arrangements with Medicare Advantage plans and accountable care organizations. Chance said that strategy aligns with a plan the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation recently laid out calling for new delivery models that help save money and offer healthcare where people want it, including their homes. (Eastabrook, 5/28) Modern Healthcare: Elevance Sues Providers, HaloMD Over No Surprises Act Allegations An Elevance Health subsidiary is suing the billing dispute consulting company HaloMD and two hospital-based Georgia providers, alleging they conspired to exploit the No Surprises Act. Blue Cross Blue Shield Healthcare Plan of Georgia, which operates under Elevance Health's Anthem brand, filed the suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on Tuesday. The company alleges HaloMD and its out-of-network clients inappropriately won higher reimbursements through the No Surprises Act's independent dispute resolution, or IDR, system. (DeSilva, 5/28) Modern Healthcare: Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans Reverse Course On GLP-1 Coverage A handful of nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurers dipped their toes into expanding coverage for blockbuster weight-loss drugs. Then they quickly pulled them back out. It’s still early days of the glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, or GLP-1, drug phenomenon with no definitive clinical or cost-savings evidence and no blueprint for how to control spending. What is clear is the immediate consequences these costly medications have had for health insurance company bottom lines.

Experts Are Worried Paula Soldner inspected meat and poultry plants around southern Wisconsin for 38 years: "I'm talking brats, hot dogs, summer sausage, pizza." Her Department of Agriculture job required daily check-ups on factories to ensure slicers were cleaned on schedule, for example. Her signoff allowed plants to put red-white-and-blue "USDA inspected" stickers on grocery-store packages.

Politico: States Take The Reins On Insurance Reform Congressional lawmakers have tried and failed several times to push through a bipartisan, health-industry-backed bill that would speed up health insurers’ prior authorization processes for certain prescription drugs and medical services. Congress will launch another attempt this year, but a growing number of blue and red states have taken the matter into their own hands. In 2024, at least 10 states passed laws to reform the prior authorization process, according to a report from the American Medical Association. Insurers use prior authorization to control costs. The state action continues to increase in 2025.

TOKYO - May, 2025 - Tokyo-based video game developers and publishers Frontwing and Bushiroad have released the visual novel “Perennial Dusk -Kinsenka-” on Steam. The game is available with Japanese, English, and Simplified Chinese text options, retailing at $29.99. “Perennial Dusk -Kinsenka-” is a kinetic novel about a group of exorcists-in-training who face horrific beings known as Maledicts, set in a strange world where the living and the dead mingle. Told through the perspective of multiple narrators, it explores how the human heart endures relentless violence and limitless cruelty. The game features well-known anime voice actresses including Manaka Iwami (Akane, “Oshi no Ko”)—who voices both Matsuri and her alter-ego Nobody as two separate heroine characters in the game—and Yumiri Hanamori (Yuka, “Blue Period”; Hanasaka, “Kaguya-sama: Love is War”)—who voices male protagonist Sai. Sample voice clips of all characters who have already been revealed are available on the game's official website. The story is written by Yukito Urushibara, a well-established writer for popular visual novels such as “Irotoridori no Sekai” and “Sakura, Moyu. -as the Night's, Reincarnation-.” The illustrations are done primarily by Saine, who also created the character designs for most of the game's characters, and Akio Watanabe of “Monogatari” series fame. The theme song, “Anata no Kioku no Naka de,” (“Inside Your Memories”) is sung by Mao Uesugi, one of the vocalists of internationally renowned musical group fripSide. The game's opening video can be viewed on its Steam store page and the Frontwing YouTube channel. An Expansion Patch is also available specifically for the Steam version of the game. The game with the Expansion Patch does not contain explicit sexual imagery, but features depictions of extreme violence, references to abuse and other mature themes that call for viewer discretion. STORY Tachibana Sai lives only to protect his sister from harm, often resorting to lethal means to do so. Weary of the persistent numbness in his heart, he welcomes the prospect of death... That is, until a fateful meeting with Matsuri fills him with a searing pain—a feeling he can only interpret as love. Upon Sai joining their ranks as the newest resident, the ill-assorted group of exorcists-in-training and their reckless mentor find a home together in an old apartment building. A ruthless boy who knows no pain in his heart. A lonely girl without any friends. A friendly girl who struggles to make connections. A prickly, ambitious girl who is keen to be of help. A boy who loves his own cute self above anything else. A mess of a woman who tries to solve everything through brute force. And a boy with a tender heart who knows no pain in his body. Bathed in the light of an everlasting sunset, they begin to experience contentment for the first time in their miserable lives. Yet, with their occupation leading to increasingly vicious foes, they are doomed to violent deaths. With Sai now in their midst, only time will tell whether they encounter the hearts they never knew or succumb to the horrors of the dusk.

Title: CEO pay rose nearly 10% in 2024 as stock prices and profits soared
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/05/29/ceo-pay-rises/
Time Published: 2025-05-29T12:47:59Z

By MAE ANDERSON and PAUL HARLOFF, AP Business Writers NEW YORK (AP) — The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply. Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can’t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits. The Associated Press’ CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30. Here are the key takeaways from the survey: The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year. CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong. The stock market’s main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%. “2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,” said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent “long-overdue” increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world’s richest countries still struggle to pay their bills. Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon’s shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023. Almost all of Smith’s pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted. Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards. The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar. “For CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,” said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. “Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.” Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is “that share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.” But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a “phenomenal rise” in CEO compensation “tracking recent years’ market performance,” which has “widened the pay gap within workplaces.” Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett’s compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla’s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle. Other notable CEOs didn’t meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks’ Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30. At half the companies in AP’s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company’s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018. The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald’s CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company’s median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries. Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included. “With CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,” Anderson said. “These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value – they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.” For the 27 women who made the AP survey — the highest number dating back to 2014 — median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts. The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks’ compensations was in the form of stock awards. Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million). Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs. “There are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we’re really not moving the needle significantly,” she said. Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson. Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023. Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.

May 29, 2025 08:46 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: CEO pay rose nearly 10% in 2024 as stock prices and profits soared

The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply NEW YORK -- The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply. Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can’t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits. The Associated Press’ CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30. Here are the key takeaways from the survey: The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year. CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong. The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%. “2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,” said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent “long-overdue” increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills. Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023. Almost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted. Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards. The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar. “For CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses," said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. "Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.” Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is “that share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about." But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a “phenomenal rise” in CEO compensation “tracking recent years' market performance,” which has "widened the pay gap within workplaces." Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla’s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle. Other notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30. At half the companies in AP’s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company’s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018. The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries. Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included. “With CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,” Anderson said. "These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value – they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.” For the 27 women who made the AP survey — the highest number dating back to 2014 — median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts. The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards.

Title: What Recent Tech Layoffs Reveal About The 2025 Job Market

ByAndrew Fennell ByAndrew Fennell, Contributor. In April alone, more than 23,000 tech workers lost their jobs. Klarna, Duolingo, Cisco, and Amazon all made sweeping cuts – but not in the areas you might expect. While some teams are shrinking, others are growing. The 2025 job market isn’t collapsing – it’s restructuring. These layoffs aren’t just about cost-cutting. They’re a signal of how the workplace is shifting: automation is accelerating, skill demands are evolving, and job security is increasingly tied to how adaptable you are. Here’s what the recent tech layoffs reveal – and what you can do about it. The current wave of layoffs isn’t a simple result of poor earnings or pandemic aftershocks. Companies are streamlining to shift investment into AI and automation. Klarna announced cuts to its customer experience and marketing departments shortly after revealing a major AI chatbot rollout. Cisco trimmed 4,000 roles to focus on AI-enabled networking. Duolingo, despite strong growth, cut staff as it leans into automated content generation. According to Layoffs.fyi, tech job losses in April 2025 marked the second-highest monthly total since early 2023. These aren’t panic layoffs – they’re part of a realignment toward a leaner, AI-augmented future. If you dig into the affected departments, a clear pattern emerges. Customer support, operations, and marketing teams are taking the brunt of cuts – especially where automation is viable. Generalist and mid-level roles, particularly those without tech specialisation, are proving vulnerable. Internal functions like HR, recruiting, and learning and development are also being consolidated or outsourced in many organisations. The pressure is greatest on roles that don’t directly contribute to AI products or data infrastructure – or can be replaced by them. This doesn’t mean you need to be a coder to stay employed. But it does mean you need to understand how your role interacts with emerging tech. The same companies issuing layoffs are aggressively hiring in other departments. Salesforce has opened dozens of new roles in AI product strategy, for instance. Even Amazon, after recent cuts, is recruiting for machine learning engineers and data architects. As Jack Kelly notes in Forbes, AI-driven productivity gains are enabling companies to achieve more with fewer employees, leading to a reduced demand for entry and mid-level roles. Jobs aren’t disappearing – but they are moving up the skill chain. Tech layoffs are rising — but they reveal a broader shift in where opportunity lies. Despite headlines, many parts of the job market remain active – and even booming. AI and machine learning roles continue to grow, with engineers and product managers in high demand. Cybersecurity and compliance are also thriving, particularly in finance and healthcare. Data and cloud infrastructure roles – like DevOps engineers and data analysts – are seeing consistent hiring. And consulting giants like McKinsey and Deloitte are scaling digital transformation and AI advisory teams. Even public sector and nonprofit tech teams are expanding – especially in climate, healthcare, and education tech. LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky has highlighted how jobs are evolving faster than ever, noting that “even if you’re not looking to change your job, your job is likely changing on you.” His point reflects a broader trend in the 2025 job market: the most secure careers are those that combine domain expertise with adaptability and emerging tech literacy – particularly AI. If you’re in a role that feels at risk – or just uncertain – the smartest move is to upskill in a direction the market is already heading. Take Rachel, a mid-level marketing manager affected by a recent restructure. Rather than chasing the same title, she completed a six-week prompt engineering course and began freelancing on generative AI campaigns. Within months, she landed a role leading AI content strategy at a fintech startup. Her path reflects a broader trend: roles that blend business insight with emerging tech are in high demand. If you're in marketing, explore AI content tools or data-driven growth roles. For those in operations or support, learning automation platforms or customer analytics can offer a competitive edge. HR professionals can gain traction in tech recruitment or people analytics. Platforms like Coursera, edX, and Google Career Certificates offer affordable routes into these growing areas. McKinsey’s 2024 Technology Trends Outlooksupports this shift, noting a 111% year-on-year increase in generative AI job postings and underscoring the value of “fusion” roles that pair technical fluency with business acumen. In a 2025 job market shaped by AI, your most valuable assets are adaptability and a skill set aligned with where your industry is going – not where it’s been. If you’re job hunting, don’t limit yourself to your current title. Ask yourself what parts of your role can’t be automated. Identify adjacent skills that are gaining demand. And scan for sectors still investing in talent. Because the future of work won’t belong to those who never face disruption. It will belong to those who know how to pivot through it.

Title: The CEO of a top AI startup gave a stark warning about the tech's impact on the labor market

Good morning! A federal court ruled President Donald Trump doesn't have the authority to impose some of his tariffs. The three-judge panel's unanimous ruling declared the tariffs would be vacated, throwing a massive wrench into what has been a key piece of Trump's second term. The federal government has filed a notice of appeal on the court's decision. We're also looking at Anthropic's CEO stark warning about the tech's impact on the labor market. What's on deck Markets: The internet has a new favorite meme trade. Tech: Nvidia shows no signs of slowing down amid tariff uncertainty. Business: Elon Musk says his time as a government employee is coming to an end and thanks Trump. But first, AI in the office. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A top AI executive is ringing the alarm bell on … AI. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and push unemployment to as high as 20% within the next five years. The above might seem like a coy way of touting a product's power in an ultra-competitive space, but Amodei told Axios he has "a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming." Some companies are ready to push the limits of an AI-led workforce. Take Retool, a platform for building AI applications. Its CEO, David Hsu, told BI's Lakshmi Varanasi its clients are asking "How do we get LLMs to actually replace labor?" It wasn't always supposed to be like this. Remember when AI was going to supercharge employees? The tech was going to make us as efficient as possible! Humans and AI — the best collab since peanut butter and jelly. So what happened? AI costs a lot of money to develop, and that's a problem with so much economic uncertainty. Sprinkle in an industry push to increase efficiency and reduce bureaucracy, and robots suddenly look much better than humans. The great AI automation comes with risks, though. (And I'm not talking about entrusting your business to a black box you don't really understand.) As BI's Katie Notopoulos recently detailed, the excitement a CEO (and their investors) has over AI adoption isn't always matched by their customer base. Just ask Duolingo. It's not all bad news when it comes to AI. I hate to leave you on such a downer, especially right before a summer Friday. Here are some ways people are making AI work for them. Finally, something for the young developers out there. Plenty of tech executives have said junior coders are an endangered species thanks to AI's programming capabilities. But AWS executive Rory Richardson sees AI giving a big boost to people early in their careers, allowing them to catch up to veteran employees. She's not alone in viewing AI as the great equalizer in the workplace. 1. GameStop made its first-ever crypto investment. Making good on its promise to buy bitcoin, the gaming retailer announced that it purchased 4,710 tokens, which are worth about $510 million. It's the latest company to add bitcoin to its balance sheet. 2. For Wall Street, TACO Tuesday is now every day. Investors are living by a new rule to play the market: TACO, or "Trump Always Chickens Out," the idea that markets can bet on Trump walking back tariff proposals. 3. Wealthy clients wanted. JPMorgan is opening 14 new financial centers across four states, offering highly specialized services to people with at least $750,000 in deposits and investments. It's part of the bank's greater mission to woo the millionaire class. 1. Meta wants to get physical. The tech giant is working on a project to open physical stores and hire retail workers, per an internal communication seen by BI. The plan could boost its hardware products' sales, although it's unclear how many stores Meta might open and when. 2. Apple's playing catch-up in the AI race. Apple has very few of the AI building blocks its competitors enjoy, some of which have been in the making for 25 years. It may need to partner with rivals or make acquisitions to catch up, BI's Alistair Barr writes. 3. Nvidia beat Wall Street's Q1 forecast. The chip giant reported revenue of $44.06 billion, compared to estimates of $43.32 billion, with the stock up 3% in after-hours trading. However, Nvidia's China sales were hit hard by US export restrictions, and it expects to take $8 billion in losses of H20 chips revenue in Q2. 1. Millennial divorce is here, and it's expensive. Divorce isn't as common among millennials as it was among boomers, but it's much more financially disruptive. It can potentially decimate savings and lock divorcees out of the housing market. Often, women pay the steepest price. 2. Elon Musk's exit from the government. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO announced on Wednesday his time as a US government employee is coming to an end, and thanked President Trump for the opportunity to "reduce wasteful spending" at DOGE. His announcement came a day after he criticized Trump's "big beautiful bill," saying it undermined DOGE's work. 3. Trump's Big Law losing streak. Federal judges have blocked the Trump administration's executive orders targeting WilmerHale, Jenner & Block, and Perkins Coie, and they're citing Trump's deal with Paul Weiss as an example. Here are five of the sharpest takedowns from judges so far. Costco, Gap, and Best Buy report earnings. The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market performance and candlestick charts visible in the background, highlighting CrowdStrike's real-time financial trends, stock price fluctuations, market volatility, and investment developments within the cybersecurity, cloud security, and technology sectors, on March 3, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is set to announce its earnings on Tuesday, June 3, 2025. For traders focusing on events, grasping the stock's historical behavior around earnings announcements can provide valuable insights. Over the last five years, CrowdStrike's shares have exhibited a pattern of positive one-day returns following earnings announcements in 55% of cases. The median positive return on these days was 9.3%, with the highest single-day gain reaching 13.6%. While the actual outcomes relative to consensus and expectations will significantly impact the stock's trajectory, historical trends can give traders an advantage. Traders may contemplate two primary strategies: Analysts expect CrowdStrike to report earnings of $0.66 per share on revenue of $1.11 billion. This compares to the same quarter last year, when the company disclosed earnings of $0.93 per share on revenue of $921 million. From a fundamental standpoint, CrowdStrike currently holds a market capitalization of $117 billion. Over the previous twelve months, the company realized $4.0 billion in revenue. Nonetheless, it reported operational losses, with -$120 million in operating losses and a net income of -$19 million. That being said, if you’re looking for upside with reduced volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative—having surpassed the S&P 500 and yielding returns greater than 91% since its launch.

View earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights regarding one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional information regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post-earnings is compiled along with the statistics in the table below. CRWD 1D, 5D, and 21D Post-Earnings Return A relatively less risky strategy (although it may not be effective if the correlation is low) is to analyze the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post-earnings, identify a pair that demonstrates the highest correlation, and make the necessary trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader can take a "long" position for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. CRWD Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 21D Historical Returns Sometimes, the performance of peers can impact post-earnings stock reaction. In fact, the pricing-in may commence even before the earnings are revealed. Below is some historical data regarding the past post-earnings performance of CrowdStrike stock in comparison with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings shortly before CrowdStrike. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also reflect post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. CRWD Correlation With Peer Earnings Discover more about Trefis RV strategy, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), yielding strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you desire upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock like CrowdStrike, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception.

(Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Yes, we think so. Currently, Nvidia (NASDAQ; NVDA) stock trades at 44 times its trailing earnings of $3.19 per share. This figure aligns with the stock’s average P/E ratio over the last two years, and growth has remained solid thus far. The real question is whether this growth will continue, which we’ll delve into in the sections below. First, let's examine what happened in the recently reported Q1. Nvidia recently announced its fiscal first-quarter results for the period ending April 2025, reporting adjusted earnings of $0.96 per share on revenues of $44.1 billion. This represents a significant 69% year-over-year increase in sales and a 57% growth in earnings. The company performed better than Wall Street’s expectations, which had projected adjusted earnings of $0.93 per share on sales of $44.3 billion. However, the company’s outlook of $45 billion in Q2 sales missed the Street’s estimates of around $46 billion. This weaker guidance was primarily due to an expected $8 billion hit to the top line from recent export restrictions on the company’s H20 chips bound for China. During the quarter, the company spent $14.1 billion on share repurchases and paid $244 million in dividends. Separately, see – What's Happening With CRM Stock? After exceeding analyst estimates, Nvidia’s stock surged around 5% in after-hours trading on Wednesday, May 28. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Looking at segments, data center revenue reached $39.1 billion, marking a 73% year-over-year increase. Gaming & AI PC was up 42%, Professional Visualization sales grew 19%, and Automotive & Robotics revenue increased by 72%. This growth was primarily driven by continued strong demand for the company’s GPU chips, which are heavily used in generative AI applications. Nvidia has also ramped up large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, with their advanced AI capabilities and premium pricing, have contributed significantly to top-line growth. Nvidia’s Blackwell cloud is now available on major platforms including AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Microsoft has been a substantial buyer of these Blackwell chips. However, the company’s gross margins of 61% were down 1,790 basis points from 78.9% in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the one-time charge from H20 sales restrictions, the gross margin would have been 71.3%. Nvidia stock is a market darling, and its Q1 performance may lead to a further spike, possibly pushing it towards its 52-week high. However, consider this: can such growth truly be sustained? Is a valuation of 44 times trailing earnings justified? Nvidia's phenomenal growth is a recent phenomenon, and it might not last. Indeed, the entire AI boom could fizzle, or perhaps large AI models, in particular, could be deemed unnecessary. Deepseek's demonstration that smaller models can perform just as well, without even utilizing Nvidia's latest chips, raises questions. However, what are the odds that Nvidia's chips will cease to be in high demand? That's where the speculation begins. Nvidia's revenues have grown by more than 80% annually for each of the last three years, with last year exceeding 100% growth. Could this growth decelerate to 60% or even 40%? It almost certainly has to—and soon! Why? Nvidia’s largest customers include tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon. Each of these companies spent tens of billions last year on Nvidia chips. Can these companies continue to increase their spending on Nvidia chips by 100% year after year, especially when their own revenues are growing at only about 15% annually? No, absolutely not. The era of Nvidia’s 80-100% growth must eventually come to an end. When this period of rapid expansion concludes, Nvidia’s valuation will likely drop significantly. In fact, we currently estimate Nvidia’s Valuation to be around $100 per share, reflecting a downside of over 25% from the current levels. Note that we will revise our model shortly to reflect the latest quarterly results. However, growth could then stabilize at a more sustainable pace of 20-30%, which, while not exceptionally high, is still respectable. That’s why you build a portfolio. A resilient one. Balance risk-reward. We did it in spades with the Trefis High Quality (HQ) portfolio. Balancing risk-reward is how HQ outperformed the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, and the Russell 2000. HQ outperformed all of them, and clocked >91% returns since inception!

Title: Apple is falling behind its Magnificent 7 rivals. Here's why

The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks led the market’s post-pandemic boom. But as Big Tech sprints into the AI future, one big name is falling dangerously behind: Apple (AAPL). Once an undisputed tech heavyweight, it risks becoming the least magnificent of them all. While the others — Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook parent Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) — race ahead thanks to leaps in AI and demand for data centers, Apple is stuck in reverse. Its share price is down about 18% so far this year, making it the worst-performing member of the Mag 7 — and a drag on the very tech rally it once helped drive. Once the most valuable company in the world, Apple’s market cap is now in third place, behind Microsoft and Nvidia. The message from Wall Street? Apple still matters, but it’s not setting the tone anymore. Apple’s Mag 7 peers have blazed new paths with AI in recent years. Microsoft has embedded generative AI into Office, Windows, and Azure — and is working on the next frontier, agentic AI. Google has rolled out Gemini across just about all of its products. Meta is pivoting from the metaverse to machine learning. Amazon has gone deep on infrastructure and developer tools through AWS to position itself as the AI enabler. Tesla has staked out a position at the forefront of embodied AI, from cars to robots. And Nvidia’s chips have become synonymous with the infrastructure powering the industry. Meanwhile, Apple, late last year, finally unveiled Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-driven features and a Siri revamp powered by ChatGPT. But Apple was late to the party, largely relied on a partner rather than a breakthrough, and has barely made a dent since. Rollout has been sluggish, features are still limited and easily found elsewhere, and Apple hasn’t announced much else. In a market moment defined by fast, flashy AI moves, the company has showed up late — and quietly. The last big thing Apple announced was Vision Pro, its $3,500 headset that was pitched as a new computing platform. But sales have been underwhelming, and developer interest has fizzled. Analysts now say fewer than 500,000 units were sold in its first year, a fraction of expectations. The company’s attempt at an autonomous vehicle also flopped. It was shelved after 10 years and more than $10 billion. Technology is a hit-based business, and Apple, the company behind the iPhone and the iPad, hasn’t had a hit in a while. Meanwhile, former Apple design chief Jony Ive is working with OpenAI on a big bet: 100 million physical AI “companions” that the company hopes to roll out by the end of next year. In other words, devices that could threaten the iPhone’s dominance. While Apple’s Mag 7 peers seem to be building the future, Apple is updating the present. It makes cyclical hardware updates, but they’re evolutionary, not revolutionary. Read more: Apple’s brutal year keeps getting worse Apple is expected to make announcements in the coming months. The most interesting might be AI-powered glasses that Bloomberg reports could feature built-in cameras, microphones, and speakers. But Meta already has a smart glasses partnership with Ray Ban (EL). Mark Zuckerberg’s company has sold two million pairs since the collaboration’s 2023 launch and is planning to produce 10 million units a year by 2026. Apple’s first-quarter earnings report showed that hardware margins are dropping as its product line matures. Apple’s crown jewel Services segment (which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV) is growing, but it’s not growing fast enough to offset hardware stagnation. And legal scrutiny of Apple’s App Store looms large. Wall Street loves high-margin, high-growth stories. Right now, Apple is high margin but low growth. China has been central to Apple’s strategy for years, but the country is now a source of stress, slippage, and softening sales. In late 2024, iPhone shipments in China cratered by more than 20%, according to Counterpoint Research. Based on Canalys data for the first quarter of 2025, Apple now ranks fifth in China’s smartphone market. And Apple can’t even lean on its AI play as a differentiator in China. The company’s ChatGPT integration, part of Apple Intelligence, had to be stripped from iPhones to comply with China’s generative AI rules. The company’s struggles in China don’t even take into account the swirling — and massive — economic headwinds from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. On Apple’s last earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said the company could see an estimated $900 million added to its costs this quarter, assuming tariff rates stayed the same. Trump’s tariffs on China have come down, but they remain unpredictable, and Apple is almost certain to feel their impact. Apple has had to reassess its once-vaunted China-centric supply chain as geopolitics, nationalism, and business risk converge. Over the past two years, the company has aggressively shifted manufacturing out of China — pumping billions into India and shifting select operations to Vietnam for components such as AirPods and MacBooks. But Trump has repeatedly attacked Apple and Cook for moving production to India, not the U.S. The president recently floated the idea of a 25% tariff on all imported iPhones. And Cook was notably missing from Trump’s Middle East tech tour, which featured other Big Tech leaders. Once considered the Trump whisperer of Big Tech, Cook has become a more distant figure from the White House in recent months. Announcements in the coming months could, of course, change things for Apple. Microsoft stock languished for 14 years after Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and Steve Ballmer took over, but the company has been a rocket ship since Satya Nadella succeeded Ballmer in 2014 and reoriented the company toward the cloud — and then AI. Apple could likewise surprise Wall Street with a flashy AI demo, a set of tools, or a shift in strategy. Yes, Apple still dominates in devices. But in a moment defined by ambition, speed, and AI supremacy, that hasn’t been enough. Right now, Apple isn’t losing. It’s just not leading. And in an AI-driven market, that might be worse.

However, the NCLT’s order did not specify the reliefs. Media reports said relief included freezing of accounts held by Gensol and its promoters, among others. Gensol Engineering Ltd. along with other respondent companies and associated individuals, have committed grave violations of corporate governance norms, the counsel for the Ministry of Corporate Affairs told NCLT. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd.’s board will consider a buyback of certain dollar-denominated bonds in this financial year, subject to market conditions. The board will meet on Saturday to mull the proposal, according to a stock exchange filing late on Wednesday. As per their latest financial reports, the company’s cash balance stood at Rs 8,001 crore as of the period ended March 31, 2025. Dollar bonds constitute 23 per cent of the total long-term borrowing of the company in FY25. Radico Khaitan has withdrawn the product to abide by consumer sentiment. The top court’s order came in response to a plea filed by investor Manu Rishi Gupta, who had challenged the fairness of the share valuation. He had also argued that the use of a reverse book-building (RBB) process could have ensured a better price for minority shareholders. Supreme Court has upheld the delisting of ICICI Securities, clearing the way for its merger with ICICI Bank. The Apex Court order came in response to a plea filed by an investor who had challenged the fairness of the share valuation. He had also argued that the use of a reverse book-building process could have ensured a better price for minority shareholders. ICICI Securities was delisted this year in March and became a wholly owned subsidiary of ICICI Bank. In his plea, Gupta said that the delisting process was not transparent and ‘shocking’ in its execution. Reliance Power’s subsidiary, Reliance NU Energies Private Limited (Reliance NU Energies), has received a Letter of Award (LOA) from SJVN Limited, a Navratna Central Public Sector Enterprise, for a 350 MW inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected solar power project coupled with a 175 MW/700 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo), India’s preferred airline, announced the appointment of Vikram Singh Mehta as the Chairman of the Board. Mehta has been a Member of the Board of InterGlobe Aviation Limited (IndiGo) since May 2022. He succeeds Dr. Venkataramani Sumantran, who stepped down from the post after completion of his five-year term as a Board Member. Dr. Sumantran was appointed as the Chairman of the Board in May 2022 and post COVID, navigated the Board during IndiGo’s strong recovery and incredible growth over the past three years. Wardwizard Innovations & Mobility Ltd. (WIML), one of India’s leading EV manufacturers under the brands ‘Joy e-bike’ and ‘Joy e-rik,’ has entered into a strategic partnership with XiCon International Ltd., a Mumbai-based engineering and manufacturing company and a subsidiary of Kaiser Corporation. Through a detailed MoU, XiCon will lease electric scooters from Wardwizard to enhance last-mile delivery solutions, marking its entry into the electric mobility sector and expanding its diversified portfolio across power, telecom, and infrastructure. Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran will step down as Chairman and Director of Tata Chemicals, effective May 29, 2025. The development was disclosed in a regulatory filing by the company. The Tata Chemicals Board of Directors formally acknowledged Chandrasekaran’s decision to step down and appointed S Padmanabhan, an existing director of the company, as the new chairman, effective May 30, 2025.

Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human. The results announced Wednesday for the February-April period came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again trade war that has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward. But Trump’s tariffs — many of which have been reduced or temporarily suspended – hammered the market values of Nvidia and other tech powerhouses heading into the springtime earnings season as investors fretted about the trade turmoil dimming the industry’s prospects. Those worries have eased during the past six weeks as most Big Tech companies lived up to or exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, capped by Nvidia’s report for its fiscal first quarter. Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, for the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government’s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts. In another positive sign, Nvidia predicted its revenue for the May-July period would be about $45 billion, roughly the level that investors had been anticipating. The forecast includes an estimated $8 billion loss in sales to China due to the export controls during its fiscal second quarter, after the restrictions cost it about $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter. “Global demand for NVIDIA’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. The performance bolstered Nvidia’s shares, which gained more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. Nvidia’s stock price ended Wednesday’s regular trading session at $134.81, just slightly below where it stood before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. The price had plunged to as low as $86.62 last month during a nosedive that temporarily erased $1.2 trillion in shareholder wealth. The outlook began brightening for Nvidia last month after AI leaders such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms reaffirmed their plans to invest heavily in AI. That spending has been a boon for Nvidia because its chipsets provide the technology’s brainpower, an advantage that has helped the company's annual revenue from $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years. Wedbush Securities analyst estimates Big Tech companies will spend about $325 billion on long-term investments primarily revolving around AI this year, with a substantial chunk of that money budgeted for Nvidia’s chips. Trump’s trade war has been raising doubts about Nvidia’s ability to maintain its astounding momentum by threatening to close off key market, especially China. In apparent attempt to curry favor with the president, Huang last month announced Nvidia will help boost U.S. manufacturing by building some of its AI chips and supercomputers in plants located in Arizona and Texas. Huang also accompanied Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, signaling Nvidia’s ambitions to sell more of its AI chips in the Middle East as that region attempts to lessen its economy dependence on oil. Trump also extended a helping hand to Nvidia of by rescinding the scheduled start export controls that had been drawn up under President Joe Biden’s administration that would have broadened the restrictions on chips sales in foreign markets beyond the limits already in place on deals with China and Russia.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) Jarrett Stepman / @JarrettStepman Jarrett Stepman is a columnist for The Daily Signal. He is also the author of "The War on History: The Conspiracy to Rewrite America's Past." Send an email to Jarrett Trust in corporate media has disintegrated in recent years and even the most powerful legacy institutions are facing a reckoning. The Washington Post, which is owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, announced Monday that it was laying off a sizable chunk of its staff. “Today, we are announcing that The Washington Post is offering a Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) to news employees with 10 or more years’ service at The Post, as well as to all members of the video department and to all members of the copy desk and sports copy desk,” Washington Post executive editor Matt Murray wrote in a staff memo obtained by Fox News. The memo further said that this was part of the Post’s “ongoing newsroom transformation efforts aimed at reshaping and modernizing the newsroom for the current environment.” It’s been a turbulent decade for the Post. It was one of the most aggressive defenders of the bureaucracy and the deep state in President Donald Trump’s first term. It leaned even further to the Left in the Biden years and went from denying that the deep state exists to actively celebrating it. It hired social media columnist Taylor Lorenz in 2022, a COVID-19 lockdown extremist to say the least. Lorenz eventually parted ways with the Post in October after she called President Joe Biden a war criminal, then seemingly tried to cover it up. By the way, she’s made a full transition from Left to bloodthirsty Left, openly gushing (might I say swooning?) over Luigi Mangione, who allegedly shot and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in cold blood. Lorenz was just a small part of the newspaper’s problems as their readership plummeted and it burned through money. In 2023 it laid off about 10% of its staff. Yet, the former media giant’s financial troubles continued. According to a January report in Semafor, the Post had “22.5 million daily active users” in January 2021 when Biden took office. By the middle of 2024, those numbers had dropped to “2.5-3 million daily users.” It gets worse. The Wall Street Journal reported in January that the Post lost “around $100 million” last year. “The Post’s loss in 2024 was roughly 30% greater than the loss a year earlier, according to people close to the company,” The Wall Street Journal reported. “Advertising revenue fell to $174 million from $190 million in 2023, missing a target, according to a person familiar with the Post’s finances.” Bezos is a rich man but it’s clear that even he had his limits with a publication that was bleeding readership and money at an astounding rate. He seemed to conclude that the issue wasn’t merely a bloated staff, but something more fundamental. The publication didn’t endorse a presidential candidate in 2024. This was met, to no surprise, by much internal wailing and gnashing of the teeth. The publication continued laying off its staff as Trump was on the eve of retaking his office, despite The Washington Post Guild’s insistence that the publication was “growing.” A statement from the Guild on today's unconscionable layoffs at The Washington Post. pic.twitter.com/Xnn5NcNJFb Not long after, Bezos sent out a memo to staff that he shared on X saying that the publication was going to start focusing on two pillars: “personal liberties and free markets.” He also announced there would be a change in leadership for the opinion page. This appeared to cause another internal meltdown, with some Washington Post journalists lashing out publicly. Changes at the Post clearly haven’t come quickly enough given Monday’s news about additional layoffs. The publication remains reliably left-wing and produces a steady stream of anti-Trump news and editorials. It’s been one of the most constant critics of entrepreneur Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency layoffs of government employees, which is interesting given that its publication is currently getting the internal DOGE treatment. Much like the Democratic Party, The Washington Post hasn’t found a way to find its footing in the Trump years. Its audience has dwindled, Americans no longer implicitly trust it, and the true reboot has yet to take place as alternative media outlets thrive and take its place. Maybe, just maybe, legacy media outlets can try not being hyperbolically negative toward the Trump administration, supported by more than half the country, nearly 100% of the time. They could try finding just a little balance in their coverage and get back to basics. If they don’t, I imagine that the bottom will continue falling out and the layoffs will continue. Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us DeepSeek has gone viral. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms. In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free. DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math. There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. In March, DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. “[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March. In May, DeepSeek released an updated version of its R1 reasoning AI model on the developer platform Hugging Face. If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. It’s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined. DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” The company’s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18% in January, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers that DeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. In March, OpenAI called DeepSeek “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek. During Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” saying that it and other “reasoning” models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute. At the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments, including South Korea. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices. In May, Microsoft vice chairman and president Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing that Microsoft employees aren’t allowed to use DeepSeek due to data security and propaganda concerns. As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices. This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly.

Title: Part 3: Building an AI-powered assistant for investment research with multi-agent collaboration in Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Bedrock Data Automation

In the financial services industry, analysts need to switch between structured data (such as time-series pricing information), unstructured text (such as SEC filings and analyst reports), and audio/visual content (earnings calls and presentations). Each format requires different analytical approaches and specialized tools, creating workflow inefficiencies. Add on top of this the intense time pressure resulting from rapidly evolving industry conditions and narrow decision windows. Delayed analysis can mean missed opportunities or failure to identify emerging risks, with potentially significant financial consequences. AI-assistants boost productivity by automating routine data collection and processing tasks, surfacing relevant insights, and allowing analysts to focus on higher-value activities. However, a single AI agent struggles with complex, multistep investment research workflows to effectively handle the full spectrum of multiple specialized tasks. This is where multi-agent collaboration provides an advancement. By creating specialized AI subagents that excel in specific tasks and functionalities and using them together under a coordinated framework using an AI supervisor agent, we can address the full complexity of investment research workflows. A supervisor agent can intelligently decompose complex queries, delegate specialized tasks to subagents, and synthesize their outputs into comprehensive answers—similar to how a research team functions in the real world. The benefits of this approach are substantial, stemming from distributed problem-solving and specialization, improved accuracy through specialized expertise, enhanced scalability by adding new agent capabilities without rebuilding the entire system, and greater transparency because the reasoning process of each specialized agent can be tracked and verified. Amazon Bedrock Agents uses the reasoning of foundation models (FMs), APIs, and data to break down user requests, gather relevant information, and efficiently complete tasks. With the multi-agent collaboration capability of Amazon Bedrock, you can build, deploy, and manage multiple AI agents working together on complex multistep tasks that require specialized skills. Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) enables the generation of useful insights from unstructured multimodal content such as documents, images, audio, and video for your AI-powered applications, and it can be used as a parser when setting up a knowledge base for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. In this post, we walk through how to build a multi-agent investment research assistant using the multi-agent collaboration capability of Amazon Bedrock. Our solution demonstrates how a team of specialized AI agents can work together to analyze financial news, evaluate stock performance, optimize portfolio allocations, and deliver comprehensive investment insights—all orchestrated through a unified, natural language interface. We use BDA as a parser when setting up a knowledge base for RAG workflows with multi-modal data. Anthropic Claude models in Amazon Bedrock are used as the large language models (LLMs) associated with the supervisor agents and subagents. Check the video that demonstrates the solution, Results from these agents are demonstrative, not to be taken as financial advice. The multi-agent investment research assistant is composed of a supervisor agent and three subagents (quantitative analysis agent, news agent, and smart summarizer agent) working together in a coordinated framework, as shown in the following diagram. The supervisor agent uses the instructions you provide to understand the structure and role of each collaborator agent. The supervisor agent orchestrates the overall investment research process by breaking down user prompts, delegating subtasks to specialized subagents, and consolidating their outputs to generate the final response. Each subagent is configured to carry out specialized tasks as follows: Multi-agent collaboration works as follows: This architecture uses the strengths of the different specialized agents to comprehensively address the various aspects of investment research, and the supervisor agent provides the intelligent orchestration. The following diagram is the technical architecture. Some of the key components and the associated codes of the technical architecture are: To deploy this solution, attach the appropriate permissions for Amazon Bedrock, AWS Lambda, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to your execution role. You also need to deploy two AWS CloudFormation stacks: web_search and stock_data. For more information on the permission policy, CloudFormation stacks, and setting up the environment, refer to the README.md in the investment_research_agent repository on GitHub. To dive deeper into the solution and the code shown in this post, refer to the investment research assistant agent GitHub repo. The repo contains instructions for the end-to-end solution, including setting up the supervisor agent and subagents, associated action groups, unstructured data (earnings reports PDF files and earnings call audio files), and structured data (stocks time series). In the appendix at the end of this post, we share different questions asked by a financial analyst to the supervisor agent, the subagent invoked, and the answers from the supervisor agent. To clean up this solution, make sure to delete all agents, knowledge bases, and associated Amazon OpenSearch Serverless instances. Delete both the web_search and stock_data stacks. This will make sure that no charges are incurred after you’re finished testing this solution. Read the associated notebook in the GitHub repository for more instructions on cleaning up the agents. The multi-agent investment research assistant built using Amazon Bedrock Agents with its multi-agent collaboration feature represents how financial professionals can use AI to enhance their analytical capabilities. By using specialized agents—each focusing on distinct aspects of financial analysis—orchestrated by a supervisor agent, we’ve created a system that can process diverse data types, apply appropriate analytical techniques, and synthesize comprehensive insights in response to complex investment queries. The result is an AI assistant that can handle multistep financial analysis workflows that would otherwise overwhelm a single-agent system. The application of multi-agent collaboration extends broadly across the financial sector, from equity research and portfolio management to risk assessment and compliance monitoring. A complex financial workflow that requires multiple specialized skills and data sources can benefit from this architectural approach. The implementation uses key AWS services, including Amazon Bedrock for foundation models, the multi-agent collaboration capability of Amazon Bedrock Agents, Amazon S3 for document storage, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless for vector search capabilities, and Lambda functions for specialized actions. This serverless architecture provides scalability, and the knowledge base integration provides context from financial documents to ground the AI’s responses in factual data.

Nvidia is scheduled to report quarterly results after the bell on Wednesday, in what could be a major test of the AI trade’s resilience. Nvidia earnings are a blockbuster, market-moving event for Wall Street. Investors parse the results for any sign that AI demand or investment is waning, making the report a catalyst for AI infrastructure stocks. Most of these AI stocks are currently trading at or above their price heading into Nvidia's last earnings report at the end of February. Those results weighed heavily on the majority of AI beneficiaries. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and nuclear energy provider Vistra (VST) outpaced Nvidia’s (NVDA) 8.5% decline the day after its last report, tumbling 16% and 12%, respectively. Constellation Energy (CEG), also a nuclear power provider, slumped about 7.5%. Nvidia’s position as the world’s largest semiconductor company has made it something of a bellwether for the entire industry. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) tumbled more than 6% after Nvidia’s last report, its biggest decline since January’s DeepSeek panic caused the index to nosedive. Major Nvidia competitors Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tumbled 7% and 5%, respectively. Chip fabrication services provider Lam Research (LRCX) and memory chip maker Micron (MU) also closed sharply lower. The companies that supply data centers with essential networking equipment also tend to move on AI demand signals parsed from Nvidia’s earnings. Shares of Arista Networks (ANET) slid 5% following Nvidia’s February report, while fiber optic technology provider Corning (GLW) shed 2% and network provider Lumen Technologies (LUMN) dropped 4%. Granted, stocks within the AI ecosystem don’t always move in tandem. Nvidia shares soared more than 9% on its earnings report one year ago, but the boost its results lent to other AI infrastructure stocks fizzled out before the day’s end. Supermicro shares rose as much as 11% that day before sliding to close 3% lower.

May 28, 2025 12:10 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, May 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until July 21, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. Captioned Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc., No. 25-cv-04332 (S.D.N.Y.), the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit charges DoubleVerify and certain of DoubleVerify’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-doubleverify-holdings-inc-class-action-lawsuit-dv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify provides media effectiveness platforms. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where DoubleVerify’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (ii) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (iii) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted DoubleVerify’s profits; (v) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 28, 2024, DoubleVerify issued lower revenue growth expectations for the first quarter of 2024 due to “a slow start by brand advertisers and a slow ramp by recently signed” customers. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 21%, according to the complaint. Then, on May 7, 2024, as the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges, DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook due to customers that were pulling back on their ad spending. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell nearly 39%, according to the complaint. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending, and defendants further disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting DoubleVerify. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 36%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired DoubleVerify common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, May 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

May 28, 2025 09:11 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, May 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) on behalf of purchasers of Elevance securities between April 18, 2024 through October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period may, no later than JULY 11, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Elevance, based in Indianapolis, Ind., is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets, including contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits for eligible beneficiaries. States regularly conduct an eligibility review to “redetermine” whether Medicaid beneficiaries still qualify for coverage. According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, Defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the “redetermination” process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the cost profiles. Defendants acknowledged rising Medicaid expenses, yet assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. In truth, however, the redeterminations were causing the utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was not adequately reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to a closing price of $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Finally, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its financial results for Q3 2024, revealing that the Company had missed earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for Q3 by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Further, Elevance lowered EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to a closing price of $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024. To learn your rights or for more information, CLICK HERE or please contact Berger Montague: Andrew Abramowitz at aabramowitz@bm.net or (215) 875-3015, or Peter Hamner at phamner@bm.net. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

Geost, based in Tucson, Arizona, has a two-decade track record supporting both classified and unclassified missions with EO/IR sensors. These systems are integral to missile warning, surveillance, reconnaissance, Earth observation, and space domain awareness. The acquisition aligns with U.S. Department of Defense initiatives aimed at developing resilient space infrastructure, such as the Golden Dome architecture and the Tracking Layer from the Space Development Agency. Bringing Geost's payload technologies under Rocket Lab's umbrella enables the company to deliver more integrated spacecraft systems tailored for defense. This vertical integration is expected to reduce cost and risk while accelerating delivery timelines. Geost's sensor technologies will support real-time threat detection and situational awareness for military operations in contested space environments. The move adds Optical Systems to Rocket Lab's capabilities and further establishes the company as a disruptive force in the national security space sector. CEO Sir Peter Beck emphasized Rocket Lab's founding vision to challenge the status quo, stating: "With the acquisition of Geost, we're bringing advanced electro-optical and infrared payloads in-house to support secure, responsive, and cost-effective systems at scale." Bill Gattle, Geost General Manager and CEO of Lightridge Solutions, noted that the acquisition is a strategic fit, adding: "By bringing high-performance optical technologies in-house, Rocket Lab is strengthening its ability to deliver responsive, full-stack solutions for government and commercial missions." Rocket Lab will also acquire Geost's production assets, labs, and facilities in Arizona and Virginia, along with intellectual property and inventory. Geost's 115 employees will join Rocket Lab's growing team, expanding its global workforce to over 2,600 across multiple U.S. states, Canada, and New Zealand.

Title: An Amazon exec says junior developers have the most to gain from AI, not the most to lose

Time Published: 2025-05-28T11:50:20Z

Tech leaders have been warning that AI is coming for junior developer jobs, but one Amazon executive says entry-level engineers shouldn't be worried — and they might actually have the most to gain. Rory Richardson, director of go-to-market for generative AI at Amazon Web Services, said that AI is leveling the playing field between junior and veteran developers. "A lot of studies that we're seeing as far as the impact of generative AI on this particular population is about getting your most junior noobs more performant," she said on an episode of the "Digital Disruption" podcast that aired Tuesday. AI tools that use natural language make it easier for early-career developers to learn and contribute, Richardson said. "I don't see anyone being left behind in this, mainly because it's so darn easy to use," Richardson said. "It's not like you have to learn a new programming language. It's all through natural language." She sees the biggest shift coming for newcomers rather than veteran developers. "It's opening the aperture of who's going to be able to relate to the technology," Richardson added. Richardson's optimism stands out in an area where layoffs have been widespread and job postings for software engineers are down more than a third from five years ago. This month, Google's Jeff Dean said AI may perform at a junior coder's level "within the next year-ish." Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott predicts "95% of code is going to be AI-generated" within five years, while Anthropic's Dario Amodei expects AI to be writing "essentially all of the code" by next year. Richardson instead sees AI as changing what entry-level developers do, rather than replacing them. She compared it to when graphing calculators reshaped database administrator jobs. "We're gonna see that same shift within all of our job families, I think, over the next two years," she said. "What they actually do is probably going to change as well, meaning you're going to not see this area as just a cost center that you have to maintain old code." Richardson said that when her kid is applying for a job in 2027, they probably wouldn't relate to computer language in the same way. "But the role of invention, context switching, synthesis, those higher-order ideas that make humans super valuable are going to be even more valuable," she said. The real risk, Richardson said, isn't being too junior but refusing to adapt. "Grit, creativity, those are those are still very important, the most human things possible," she said.

Title: Govt To Hold High-Level Meet To Tackle Dark Patterns On Apps
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/05/223-govt-high-level-meet-dark-patterns-apps/
Time Published: 2025-05-28T05:20:10Z

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India Union Consumer Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi will today address consumer concerns around dark patterns on e-commerce apps at a high-level stakeholder meeting in New Delhi. This meeting aims to identify more effective ways to tackle manipulative design practices used by digital platforms. Companies such as Amazon, Swiggy, Flipkart, Zomato, MakeMyTrip, Meta, WhatsApp, Ola, and Apple will attend the meeting. National Law Universities (NLUs) and Voluntary Consumer Organisations (VCOs) have also been invited to participate. The meeting comes nearly 18 months since the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) issued guidelines to curb deceptive user interface practices. Notified in November 2023, the guidelines identified 13 dark patterns, including basket sneaking, forced action, drip pricing, confirm shaming, and false urgency. Despite notified guidelines from the Government, many platforms have made few visible changes. On Swiggy, users still see a message claiming they saved Rs 9 on delivery. That message appears above a Rs 11.80 platform fee that is added quietly in the bill. The app also nudges users to buy a Swiggy One Lite subscription by promising 10 free deliveries for three months at Rs 15. These tactics rely on presentation and timing to influence decisions. Screenshot from Swiggy showing Rs.9 savings with free delivery, even as Rs 11.80 is charged as platform fee Screenshot from Swiggy prompting users to subscribe to Lite for Rs 15 to get 10 free deliveries for three months MakeMyTrip continues to use fare tiers like Regular and Premium. Phrases such as “You are missing out on these benefits” encourage users to choose a more expensive option. The total cost builds up in stages, reflecting what the CCPA guidelines describe as drip pricing. Screenshot from MakeMyTrip showing tiered fare options like Regular and Premium Elsewhere, Zomato shows how much a user “saved” through its Gold membership, even though that discount comes from a paid subscription. A Rs 10 platform fee appears only at the final step before payment. Users are also prompted to donate Rs.4 to Feeding India, a non-profit initiative by Zomato that works to reduce hunger among underserved communities in India. While the donation is optional, it sits in the middle of the billing flow, making it easy to add without much thought. Screenshot showing “You saved Rs 21 with Gold,” a Rs 10 platform fee added at checkout, and a prompt to donate Rs 4 to Feeding India These small nudges may seem harmless, but they add up. They may play on user hesitation, create confusion, or make it easier to spend without noticing. A study published in 2024 by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) Academy and UI/UX design agency Parallel helps put these design choices in context. The researchers examined more than 12,000 screens across 53 apps, and found that nearly every app studied (98%) contained at least one dark pattern, and each app showed an average of 2.7 such patterns. The study identified the following dark patterns as most prevalent in Indian apps: The CCPA had released the guidelines to curb deceptive user interface practices after public consultation, but it removed Clause 8 from the notified guidelines. This clause, which had appeared in the draft version, had stated that the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, would apply in case of any guideline violations. This gap allows platforms to continue using dark patterns without facing legal consequences. While some may view these as common interface choices, they raise questions about how far design can go in guiding user behaviour before it becomes misleading. At the high-level stakeholder meeting held later in the day, Union Consumer Affairs Minister urged companies to conduct internal self-audits and proactively remove dark patterns from their platforms. “Companies must not wait for the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) to intervene. They should proactively recognise and remove these deceptive practices before notices are issued. This is not just regulatory compliance but it’s about building trust with your consumers,” the Minister said. Officials from the Department of Consumer Affairs highlighted a surge in consumer complaints about dark patterns on the National Consumer Helpline (NCH). They also showcased digital tools developed earlier through the Dark Patterns Buster Hackathon 2023 in collaboration with IIT-BHU. These include the Jagriti App, which enables consumers to report dark patterns; the Jago Grahak Jago App, which offers real-time safety scores for e-commerce links; and the Jagriti Dashboard, which generates analytical reports on platforms under the CCPA’s scrutiny. Officials also noted that companies who took the Safety Pledge on National Consumer Day 2024 are expected to uphold that commitment. They said that continued use of dark patterns infringes the pledge. The meeting brought platforms and regulators back to the table, but for users, it leaves a critical question unanswered: if companies are still relying on these design tricks 18 months after the guidelines were issued, what action will the government take next? The ASCI study confirmed that dark patterns are not one-off design quirks-they are systemic and widespread, especially in delivery and travel apps that continue to use tactics the government itself has labelled harmful. The guidelines offered a roadmap. The meeting reaffirmed the government’s commitment to consumer protection but whether that commitment translates into enforceable rules, legal action, or stronger penalties remains to be seen.

Title: Ad tech’s IPO dreams are stirring again – MNTN just made them look a bit more real

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead For ad tech bosses, the IPO dream is no longer just a late-night fantasy, it’s starting to look like a real possibility. “Look” being the operative word. Nothing’s guaranteed but there is momentum. MNTN’s splashy debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week didn’t just grab attention, it lit a signal flare. Priced at $16 a share on May 21, the company hit the market with a $1.2 billion valuation – right at the top of investor expectations. By Friday, it was already at $28. On Tuesday, it was around $26. “This could be a meaningful moment for the CTV advertising ecosystem, even if MNTN itself is still relatively small in the grand scheme of AdTech,” said Karsten Weide, principal and chief analyst at W Media Research. “They’ve got a few strong things going for them: the backing of Morgan Stanley gives the IPO some institutional credibility, and the cachet of Ryan Reynolds as chief creative officer continues to generate attention well beyond the industry bubble.” But as good as all this sounds for MNTN, its fate is far from sealed. At 16 years old, it’s a veteran in ad tech terms but one that’s trailing behind peers. The Trade Desk and Criteo had already crossed the billion dollar revenue mark by this point in their life cycles. MNTN, by contrast, is pulling in $225 million. “This [the IPO] is a big tell in the market that reinforces the idea that not all ad tech companies are equal in so far as the ones that are doing well are rooted in performance,” said Brian Mandelbaum, CEO of Attain, a consumer data platform focused on outcomes. Here’s a closer look at that tightrope walk, based on the company’s S-1 filing with the SEC. Since 2020, MNTN has posted a tenfold revenue jump and 769% customer growth, riding the momentum of CTV and performance-driven advertising. That’s impressive. But the gloss fades with a $32.9 million net loss in 2024. Yes, adjusted EBITDA came in positive at $38.8 million (up from $32.5 million the year prior), suggesting it’s still squeezing more out of operation, but it’s not enough to silence the skeptics. And skeptics there are. Questions around MNTN’s legacy, especially from its earlier SteelHouse chapter – and ongoing concerns about transparency haven’t gone away. In today’s ad tech market – where hype no longer sells itself – that kind of baggage could weigh heavy with institutional investors. For now, though, the market’s buying what MTNN’s selling – and that’s sending a clear signal to private equity firms. PE has long been the default exit for ad tech startups, typically offering seven to 10 times adjusted EBITDA. MNTN, by contrast, hit the public market trading at a staggering 32 times adjusted EBITDA – a multiple that puts it closer to The Trade Desk than a typical mid-market player. “This [the MNTN IPO] could put a spanner in the works when it comes to private equity investors’ plans for ad tech,” said former MNTN executive Dan Larkman, now CEO of CTV advertising partner Keynes Digital. “Even if it settles at 30 times EBITDA, that changes the PE firm’s view of trying to pay seven to 10 times EBITDA to much higher.” A recalibration of this magnitude could shift the entire trajectory for a swath of mid-sized ad tech firms. If public investors are once again willing to reward growth – especially in hotter corners of the market like CTV – the IPO window starts to look less like a last-ditch plan B and more like a viable, even preferable, way out. But only for those with the stomach for it. Going public is no cake walk. It’s a gauntlet of competing stakeholders, relentless scrutiny and virtually no margin for error. That’s why so few ad tech companies, notably The Trade Desk and Criteo, have truly stuck the landing. Still, if MNTN can handle the heat, hold the line and deliver in the quarters to come , it could change the calculus for others. After all, the risks are steep, but so is the upside. Just ask an unnamed ad tech CEO who recently relocated to New York to be closer to the action as they prepare to take their own shot at going public. “He [the CEO] told me as recently as last fall that the aim is to start that process in the near future,” said one ad exec who exchanged anonymity for candor on those plans. Then again, “in the near future” is vague enough to stretch from next quarter to next year. And that’s the tension: the return of the ad tech IPO is far from guaranteed. Solid business fundamentals don’t mean much when the markets they rely on are anything but. A choppy macroeconomic outlook, shaken by trade wars, shifting tariffs and global uncertainty, has consumer spending wobbling. When that happens ad dollars tend to follow. “MNTN isn’t about to challenge the big DSPs like DV360 or The Trade Desk,” said W Media Research’s Weide. “The functionality is much more streamlined by design for smaller advertisers, and might not be feature-rich enough for marketers at bigger advertisers. But where it could create pressure is among smaller demand-side players like StackAdapt or FreeWheel’s Beeswax.” Needless to say, if there’s a moment to make the leap, this might be it. There’s more maturity in the public market’s view of ad tech than there was a decade ago. Back then, hype outpaced clarity. Companies went public on arbitrage plays and fat margins on ad spend, with little transparency into how the sausage was made. The bubble burst, and the scars of rocky IPOs lingered. This time feels different. “Investors have a better handle on the market than they did back then, but I still don’t think they know how to value it properly,” said Keynes Digital’s Larkman. “Ad tech companies don’t own the full ecosystem the way Google or Meta do. They control just a piece of the infrastructure, which makes it harder for investors to understand where the value actually lies – and how to price it accordingly.” While Target continues to contend with sluggish sales and external economic pressures, Roundel, the retailer’s ad business, seems to be a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy financial picture. The 24-page pitch deck for Amazon’s demand-side platform is telling: it puts its off-Amazon’s ambitions in black and white. As the ceiling on sport sponsorship investment rises, room for non-standard approaches is also growing for a variety of brands.
