getty Looking to secure huge growth potential with artificial intelligence stocks? The timeline may be short. While few expect AI spending to decline in the short term, stock prices often reflect a promising outlook long before expected profits materialize. With AI adoption poised to go mainstream in the coming year, now is the time to stake your claim. Below is a brief overview of the state of AI, followed by a list of six AI stocks that look promising for 2025. A McKinsey report characterizes 2023 as the year "the world discovered generative AI (gen AI)." 2024 is when businesses began realizing value from using gen AI. The rising adoption has sparked extreme demand for AI-capable computing power. Data centers, in turn, invested billions in hardware and software for powering, developing and training AI applications. In 2025, companies like OpenAI will look to move AI's capabilities into increasingly complex tasks. Use cases for AI will expand across industries and into the personal computing space. Organizations that have invested in AI will attempt to quantify the business value of those investments. How those business value questions resolve will influence the S&P 500. Steven Wu, founding and managing partner of Carthage Capital Management, notes that nearly half of the S&P 500 is concentrated in tech stocks. "With AI expectations running high," Wu explains, "it's crucial for AI to continue meeting expectations or there may be severe consequences." Spending on AI infrastructure will likely continue, but the pace and focus of that spending may change. TechInsights predicts a greater emphasis on cost efficiency over performance. This will pressure the dominant hardware providers to evolve to meet those changing priorities.

To capitalize on the trends, I sought out the best artificial intelligence stocks with acceptable valuations, profitable business models, positive outlooks and healthy debt levels. These are the screening criteria: Only two stocks on this list have PE ratios above 40: Nvidia (NVDA) and Synopsys (SNPS). The higher valuation is an acceptable trade-off, given that these are also the only two stocks in the group with gross margins above 70%. The table below introduces the six largest AI stocks that meet the five criteria noted. Table data source: Stockanalysis.com. Now, let's explore each of these AI companies in more detail. Nvidia designs and sells high-performance semiconductors and related hardware and software. The company's hardware is used in AI-capable data centers, gaming applications, robotics and automotive applications. For the last year, Nvidia has been showing the world what's possible in terms of monetizing AI. Leveraging its reputation and the extreme demand for AI-capable chips, Nvidia has nearly tripled its enterprise value to become one of the few $3 trillion companies in the world. Nvidia's expertise and AI positioning are unrivaled. The question for investors is whether the growth opportunity is already built into NVDA's share price. The company's PE ratio is on the high side, but NVDA also has the highest EPS growth outlook and the second-highest gross margin among the stocks on this list. While the greatest gain potential for NVDA may have passed, the stock still has room to run. Taiwan Semiconductor makes semiconductors and related devices on contract for customers. The company has fabrication facilities in Taiwan, China, Japan and the U.S. TSM is the world's leading semiconductor foundry with an estimated market share of 61%, according to Statista. The closest competitor is Samsung, with 11% market share. TSM customers include leading chip designers that outsource manufacturing, such as Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. TSM has a long track record of performance and growth, built on technological expertise. The well-managed company is also critical to the AI infrastructure buildout. While Nvidia, Apple and AMD are designing the chips that will power the AI revolution, TSM is making them.

Photolithography uses light to transfer a pattern to another surface. The process is used with silicon wafers to make semiconductors. ASML is the dominant market share leader in photolithography machines for semiconductors. The company has long-term relationships with major chip foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel and Samsung. Those foundries cannot easily switch to another provider since a tooling change would require expensive downtime. ASML stock hit a high point in July 2024 and then fell 35%. Investors got nervous when the company announced a conservative guidance for next year. The dip creates a nice buying opportunity for a company that will be essential to semiconductor manufacturing for the foreseeable future. Synopsys makes electronic design automation (EDA) software that supports the design, manufacture and testing of integrated circuits. Customers span several verticals, including automotive and semiconductor design. Synopsys has been a high-performing stock for years. Morningstar quantifies its 15-year total return at 23.7%, which outperforms peers in the software infrastructure industry. The track record of performance is comforting, but it looks even better alongside Synopsys' current positioning. The company's product suite will support the AI revolution directly by enabling ongoing innovation in integrated circuit design and manufacturing. Synopsys is also in the process of acquiring engineering simulation provider Ansys (ANSS). The merger will expand Synopsys' market position and be accretive to revenue and earnings in 2025. Teradyne makes automated test equipment for semiconductors, electronic systems and wireless devices. The company also offers robotics equipment and technology. Morningstar categorizes Teradyne as a wide-moat company, meaning it has a significant and enduring competitive advantage. The heart of that advantage is Teradyne's expertise in testing high-performance semiconductors, which is largely unmatched by competitors. The company's testing solutions will be essential as semiconductors evolve to meet the performance and efficiency needs of more mature AI applications. In its third-quarter earnings release, Teradyne reported guidance-beating EPS—citing AI demand as a factor. Teradyne also offers investors revenue diversification, strong margins and good financial discipline. Since 2020, the company has reduced its debt by more than $500 million. Shutterstock licenses third-party graphics and images to corporations, broadcast companies, small and medium-sized businesses and individuals. Shutterstock recently completed the acquisition of competitor Envato. Envato expands Shutterstock's offering with a subscription for unlimited downloads—formerly a gap in the SSTK's product suite. The company is also seeing organic momentum, with improvements in content performance and growth in its Data, Distribution, and Services segment. As of the third-quarter earnings release, Shutterstock's data business had grown 40% year to date. This is how Shutterstock benefits from the AI buildout. The company currently has about two dozen deals licensing its content to train generative AI tools. As of August 2024, those deals were cumulatively worth $238 million. AI will be a driving force in the financial markets in 2025. Well-run, high-margin, adaptable businesses that support the development, training and deployment of AI applications are well-positioned for growth as the technology evolves.

The latest rally was spurred by Broadcom's better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday, and an uplifting outlook for the first quarter. Broadcom, which sells semiconductors and infrastructure software, is seeing soaring demand from the boom in generative artificial intelligence and reported a 220% jump in AI revenue for the year to $12.2 billion. Goldman Sachs analysts, who recommend buying Broadcom shares, lifted their 12-month target to $240 from $190, citing additional large customers for custom silicon. They also referenced management's execution following the $61 billion purchase of VMware, which closed last year. "We now have even higher conviction on the company's forward revenue and earnings growth outlook," the analysts wrote in a report dated Dec. 15. Barclays raised its priced target on the stock to $205 from $200, while Truist raised its call to $260 from $245. Broadcom shares are now up 126% for the year, closing at $250 on Monday. Nvidia, which has been the primary beneficiary of the AI craze due to the popularity of its graphics processing units, or GPUs, is up more than 165% this year, reaching a market cap of $3.2 trillion. The Nasdaq has gained 34%. Broadcom refers to its custom AI accelerators as XPUs, which are different than the GPUs Nvidia sells. Broadcom said it doubled shipments of XPUs in the quarter to "our three hyperscale customers." The company does not name the customers, but analysts say the three are Meta, Alphabet and TikTok parent ByteDance.

Title: Here Is How MicroStrategy Could Qualify For An Inclusion In The S&P 500 Index In 2025

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. As a levered bet on Bitcoin, which itself is one of the most volatile assets to ever exist, MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares are in the limelight these days, with investors and analysts alike honing in on the company's ever-increasing BTC holdings, which then serve to precipitate a circular "tail wags the dog" effect on the price of the world's preeminent cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD. As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/SaWLNBVkrl — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 16, 2024 In what has, by now, become a fairly predictable pattern, MicroStrategy announced on Monday that it again increased its Bitcoin holdings last week, spending ~$1.5 billion to acquire 15,350 BTC, which increases the size of its total holdings to 439,000 BTC. MicroStrategy's ever-increasing Bitcoin stash in an overall bullish crypto market could unlock a significant milestone for the company in 2025, courtesy of a recent accounting change spearheaded by the FASB. To wit, the FASB's Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 23-08, which went into effect on the 15th of December 2024, posits that entities holding crypto assets must use the fair value (market-based) approach to revalue those assets for each reporting period, with the resulting gains and losses incorporated within the net income for the pertinent period. This means that, in an environment where Bitcoin's price continues to increase in a consistent fashion, MicroStrategy is likely to record significant quarterly gains. BREAKING: Bitcoin hits $107,000, a new all time high. — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) December 16, 2024 As of the time of writing, Bitcoin has notched another all-time high of $107,000, precipitated by expectations that President-elect Trump will approve a strategic Bitcoin reserve on his very first day in office. Beyond these extrinsic factors, BlackRock recently recommended an optimal multi-asset portfolio allocation of between 1 and 2 percent to Bitcoin. For context, global reserve assets are currently valued at ~$900 trillion. A theoretical 2 percent allocation to Bitcoin can easily boost the cryptocurrency's price to $900,000. The only requirement left for $MSTR to enter the S&P 500 is to have positive earnings over the SUM of the previous 4 quarters. On a theoretical basis once FASB is implemented in Q1 2025 and with a $BTC price of $120,000 and no increase to their $BTC holdings, $MSTR will have… pic.twitter.com/4LJUCweADU — James Van Straten (@btcjvs) December 15, 2024 This brings us to the crux of the matter. For MicroStrategy shares to qualify for an inclusion in the S&P 500 index, the company has to show positive earnings on a cumulative basis for a period that covers the previous 4 quarters. MSTR has yet to satisfy this significant requirement. However, with ASU 23-08 in effect now, and paired with an environment where Bitcoin's price continues to increase, MicroStrategy can show a net income of $25 billion for Q1 2025, which should qualify it for the inclusion in the S&P 500 index, assuming an average Bitcoin price of $120,000 for the period and no additional significant BTC purchases. Bear in mind that the high-flying stock has now been added to the Nasdaq 100 index, unlocking significant passive inflows. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: BlackRock Identifies 1% to 2% as Optimal Bitcoin Allocation
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/blackrock-identifies-1-to-2-as-optimal-bitcoin-allocation/
Time Published: 2024-12-16T17:30:50Z
Full Content:
If an institutional investor wants to incorporate bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio, what is an appropriate allocation? A white paper from the BlackRock Investment Institute, “Sizing bitcoin in portfolios,” identifies a 1% to 2% allocation to bitcoin as reasonable. Any higher, and bitcoin would account for too much risk. The paper stated that a 1% to 2% allocation to bitcoin lifts the digital currency’s share of portfolio risk to 2% to 5%, in line with the average “Magnificent Seven” tech stock, which contributes approximately 4% of portfolio risk, based on current index weights. As bitcoin’s allocation in a portfolio increases, its estimated contribution to risk becomes outsized, compared with those large-cap tech stocks. For example, a 4% allocation to bitcoin would account for 14% of portfolio risk, according to the paper. Therefore, the white paper stated that an allocation to bitcoin of less than 2% would introduce a different source of return and risk, while managing risk exposure. The paper’s authors—Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s CIO of exchange-traded-fund and index investments; Paul Henderson, a senior portfolio strategist; Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets; and Vivek Paul, global head of portfolio research—wrote that bitcoin cannot be compared to traditional assets and that the main driver of the price of bitcoin will be an increase in adoption. Bitcoin is less correlated with major risk assets in the long term, with a very low correlation between bitcoin and equity returns, the authors wrote. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  Institutional ownership of bitcoin could possibly dampen the asset’s volatility, but mass adoption could also dampen future returns, according to the paper. “Broad adoption could also mean bitcoin loses the structural catalyst for further sizable price rises,” the paper stated. “The case for a permanent holding may then be less clear-cut and investors may prefer to use it tactically to hedge against specific risks, similar to gold.” BlackRock noted the high volatility of the asset. Since 2015, there have been six times when bitcoin saw a drawdown of more than 70% from its previous high, including twice—in 2015 and 2019—when the asset had a drawdown of more than 80%. “Taking all this into account, we do see a case for including bitcoin in multi-asset portfolios—provided you believe it will become more widely adopted in the future and are comfortable bearing the risk of potentially rapid price plunges,” the paper stated. Bitcoin is becoming easier to own; several firms, including BlackRock, have launched ETFs which track the price of bitcoin. These bitcoin ETFs have seen $10 billion in inflows since the U.S. election on November 5, according to data from Bloomberg. In total, more than $100 billion has flowed into these ETFs, according to the white paper. Some asset owners have included bitcoin ETFs in their portfolio, including the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which allocated $160 million to two such ETFs, one from Grayscale and one from BlackRock.

BioLineRx Ltd . (NASDAQ:BLRX) shares tumbled to a 52-week low of $0.21, reflecting a stark downturn in the biopharmaceutical company's market valuation to just $22.41 million. InvestingPro analysis indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, with analyst price targets ranging from $2 to $9. Over the past year, the stock has witnessed a precipitous decline, with the 1-year change data showing a staggering -86.35% drop. Investors have been grappling with the company's performance amidst a challenging healthcare market, regulatory hurdles, and competitive pressures. The company maintains a moderate debt level with a current ratio of 1.52, though it reported negative EBITDA of -$25.49 million in the last twelve months. The significant decrease in share price has raised concerns among stakeholders about the company's future prospects and its ability to recover from the current lows. As BioLineRx continues to navigate through these turbulent times, the market will be closely watching for any signs of a strategic turnaround that could potentially revive investor confidence. According to InvestingPro, which offers 12 additional key insights about BLRX, the company appears undervalued based on its Fair Value calculations. In other recent news, BioLineRx reported significant developments in its Q3 financial results. The company recorded a net loss of $5.8 million, showing an improvement from the $16 million loss in the same quarter of the previous year. The revenue for the quarter was $4.9 million, including $3.2 million from an upfront payment by Gloria Biosciences, and $1.7 million from U.S. sales of APHEXDA. H.C. Wainwright adjusted its outlook on BioLineRx shares, reducing the price target to $9.00 from the previous $21.00, while maintaining a Buy rating. In addition, BioLineRx secured a major licensing agreement with Airmid Limited for the drug Motixafortide. The company's cash position remains robust at $29.2 million, and it has completed debt repayment and restructuring with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). BioLineRx is also advancing its pancreatic cancer program, with interim data expected in 2026. These are recent developments that highlight the company's strategic focus on clinical development and its efforts to improve its financial standing.

So the Bitcoin revolution, the revolution will be televised. So, starting off. First, what is Bitcoin? Why does it matter? So I think the 1st important critical thing is trying to consider and think you know what is Bitcoin we’ve all heard about in the news we heard about Bitcoin as being a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme. And honestly, my mom has gone through her fair share of Ponzi schemes like she she got suckered by the whole Amway scam. I think the reason why Bitcoin is so important and critical is, Bitcoin is like the early days of the Internet. So if you go into a time machine and you could tell somebody in the past, okay, you know, in the days before email existed. Right? So okay, once one day, you know, everyone’s gonna have a supercomputer in their pocket. They’re using it to check all their bank statements. You’re going to be able to use your camera on your phone to scan your you know your checks, your bank account balances. You can use this to send money and messages and videos to everyone on the planet. Instantly everyone would have thought you were crazy.and I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. So a constructive way of thinking about bitcoin is trying to figure out what bitcoin is not. ￼My personal opinion is, I do not think that Bitcoin is actually cryptocurrency. I think currency is the Us. Dollar, and I think one of the biggest problems about the whole field of crypto and cryptocurrency is everyone is like a crypto anarchist, which means that they want to see the Us. Government and all the governments on the planet fail, and they can essentially live in peace and silent without interference from the Government. Yet, you know, obviously, at the end of the day, it’s nice to have public streets. It’s nice to not get robbed in the streets. And actually, I think one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is. People think that Bitcoin is trying to replace the Us. Dollar. But my personal thought is, Bitcoin is going to be a supplement to the Us. Dollar. Essentially, I thought this a long time ago that essentially Bitcoin is digital gold to hedge against inflation, which means, as our money, our Us. Dollars, or our euros, or our local currencies become devalued. The upside is, our Bitcoin will become more valuable. I think the best analogy that I got was from chairman of microstrategy mstr Michael saylor, essentially thinking that Bitcoin is is not digital currency, but digitalreal estate. So I think this analogy is better, because nobody’s on their zillow, you know, 20 times a day, checking their home prices right? And this is my mad Max Post Apocalyptic perspective. So imagine the future where there’s, you know, essentiallythere’s this like nuclear fallout. And you know.there’s no inhabitable places anywhere. And let us say, there’s only 21 million single family homes left on the planet for anybody to live. Obviously, sooner or later, you know, people are going to want somewhere to live. And so I think the best analogy, I think, is Bitcoin as digital real estate, which means that with digital real estate. You know, a lot of people are like– I want to quickly make money off of Bitcoin. But how do I make money off of it? It’s kind of like the early days of real estate. So if you bought Manhattan in the 1600s, you know, how do you monetize it? And I still think that we’re in the very, very early days of bitcoin and institutional adoption, which means you’re going to start to see New Bitcoin products come out. So some simple thoughts. So we’ve all heard stories of Scumbag San Francisco based scumbag landlords, you know, charging an arm and a leg for their tenants, and we all hate the landlords, I think with Bitcoin we’ll become the new digital landlords, which means effectively, we will in the future be able to like rent out our Bitcoin. And you know, let’s say we have one bitcoin right, and it’s and then I think that the personal math I like to do in my head is thinking that one Bitcoin is equivalent to one single family home. So I currently live in Los Angeles, in Culver City. It’s kind of insane. A single family home. I’ve even seen some in my neighborhood for 4.4 million dollars. The average Median household single family home is around 1.7 million dollars. So in my personal mind, where I think Bitcoin is a trillion times more valuable than physical real estate land, because you could always make more of it. It’s not a real scarcity. A single family home, and the price of a Bitcoin should be pegged to another. So in my mind I still think of a Bitcoin at least 1.11.7 2.1, maybe even 4.4 million dollars a coin. And I think this is a very very fascinating idea, because also, you know, people say, Oh, but Bitcoin is not real. Money is yeah, but like our dead, shiny rocks. Aka. Gold money either, or is fiat currency, you know pieces of paper. You cannot eat pieces of paper to to live. And I think one of the most interesting things I learned about the philosophy of money is that essentially all money is just existing in the minds and souls of men, the value for men, is all essentially subjective. Money is not “real”, but subjective. Now, what makes Bitcoin so fascinating to me is that it’s the 1st time in human existence, you had a hard cap supply of money. So, for example, people often talk about gold, right? So the issue with gold is at the time it was the least bad form of money, because it was very, very scarce. It was difficult to find. It’s difficult to mine and transport. Yet there was lots of good properties of gold. It’s, you know, essentially it kind of lasts forever. Aesthetically, it looks beautiful, the nice yellow color of gold mimics that of the sun, and you know, at least back in the day, let’s say you had gold coins it could easily fit in your front pocket whatevers. But now things become a lot more difficult because we’re living in the 21st century, the 22nd century you know, we would have flying car drone robo taxi, self driving car waymos. It’s like, Why are we still using an antiquated digital framework of modern day banking swift code accounts? If you’ve ever tried to send money, you know, from the Netherlands to South Korea, to Nigeria, to Lagos whatever you find that the the whole SWIFT system is kind of like a bunch of gangster mafiosas like even my mom is currently living in South Korea. Example if I want to just send my mom a small sum of money, it is insane, ￼ it takes like three or four days, and the wire transfer fees like 55 bucks, I hate this. This should be done instantly. Therefore the thought of bitcoin, being able to quickly and effectively and securely transfer value across time and space without a trusted intermediary is a big big deal, a big big revolution. So why does Bitcoin matter? It’s kind of like asking somebody why does clean water matter so one of the things I love about Michael Saylor, and I highly recommend watching all of his videos. @wsaylor. It’s essentially Twitter or X or michael.com. He uses this analogy of sewer water. So let us say, every all 8 billion people on the planet are all drinking sewer water, and people are dying of dysentery, and people are saying, I don’t get it, you know I exercise, you know. Iyou know I eat healthy exercise every day, but I’m still dying of dysentery. My kids are dying of dysentery, and so the whole issue is that if you’re drinking sewer water, no matter how healthy your lifestyle is, how virtuous you is. It don’t matter. You’re going to be, you know, dying of dysentery, or perpetually sick. And so, if we think about these physiological terms, and apply it to Bitcoin and money and digital capital. This becomes really fascinating because my personal thought and you know, also, I grew up in a family of poverty, poverty, meaning that I thought I was going to be homeless at least 2 or 3 times. My dad was perpetually addicted to gambling with the rent money. So what a lot of people don’t understand about growing up in poverty, and prosody is that the logical strategy that you never know when your dad is going to steal your money and gamble it away, and therefore the smart strategy is actually to spend it all right now! Because you never know when he’s going to look in your piggy bank, your personal checking account that your mom put away for your college, or even take your hard earned $3000 as a 15-year-old bus boy at your mom sushi restaurant, lying that you’re going to invest in some business, leaving to LA for about a month, gambling it away, and coming back empty. When I think about it, this is actually super sad. Once again when I was like super super young like two years old, my mom tried to make me a savings account, like one of those checking or savings investing accounts for kids, and she might’ve had a nominal amount of money in it, like 200 or 250 bucks or something. And she told me the sad news is that one day when she checked up on it she discovered that the money was gone. Essentially my dad even stole away that $250 from my child savings account for college, once again feed his gambling addiction. So once again, as a kid growing up, I never had this ethos or tactic of saving. Because we literally cannot come every dime that my mom made was fun into paying for groceries and rent. Therefore I like a 15-year-old kid, my thought was I’m going to take every single penny, I can immediately go out buying some new sneakers, you know, buy some cool clothes, and I literally had $0 in my bank account. So I think the pernicious, vicious cycle of inflation is. You cannot blame people for not saving up capital for their future if the money itself is deflating at such a rapid pace, and so I personally think that you know Bitcoin is like giving every single person on the planet like unlimited free Fiji water, or the best alkaline hipster water whatever water you want. Essentially giving people clean water. Anda lot of people say, Yeah, but Bitcoin is not real money. It’s a okay. So I think this is a big this is a big shift for me also, personally. My personal thought is, Bitcoin is actually more important than money. So we should not think about money. We should think about capital. I think capital is a lot more robust and strong as a concept. So, for example, capital comes from Cap CAP. Like upon your head. K-ap. Essentially it came from the head of oxen. So if you read the Iliad, the Odyssey essentially, every time you want to appease the gods, you have to sacrifice a hectacomb, Hecta means 100 a hundred head of oxen to appease the gods. And you know, obviously, that’s very expensive, like, can you imagine, if you know you sacrificed a hundred Lamborghinis to appease the gods, it would be quite expensive endeavor. Right? And so, capital. We all live under Capitalism — it doesn’t matter if you’re living in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, China, and also one thing that people don’t understand is, I think, what a lot of these people, maybe 4 or 5 years ago, China is going to take over. China’s not going to take over. China is dependent on America, and effectively, the Chinese Yuan the CNY is essentially effectively pegged to the Us. Dollar and the Us. The US is essentially the world. Reserve currency and capital is what we seek, not money. Talking about currency, so currency is like, you know, buying a Starbucks Frappuccino, or buying a in and out Burger. Right? That’s like money currency, right? Capital is essentially long storm, long term, store of value. So it’s building generational wealth. So one of my favorite songs from Kanye West is the off the grid songs that we off the grid grid grid this for my kid, kids, for when my kids, kids have kids. And I think this is also the big thing is a lot of millennials, nowadays, I think the disincentive to have kids is because there’s so much fear mongering about the the future is gonna become uninhabitable, you know boil the seas or whatever. So there’s not going to be a future. So essentially, there’s a strong sense of pessimism. But Bitcoin, to me is like solidified optimism, which means that the future is going to be glorious and great. And you know, even having Seneca right now, think about his future kids, kids, kids, or my future kids, kids, kids.It brings me so much joy. Because the simple strategy, you just keep stacking Bitcoin until you die, and then you hand it on to your kids. Your kids give it to their kids kids. It’s like, if you owned, you know, a hundred penthouses or 10 square blocks or 20 square blocks in Manhattan, on the main island. Do you ever sell that to buy a Lamborghini? No! That’s not what one does, or liquefy it all into us dollars and brag about how many billions of dollars you have in your bank account. Nope, that’s not the goal– you want to build capital. And traditionally it’s been real estate. But once again, real estate was a good idea. In the 16 hundreds, 17 hundreds, 18 hundreds, 19 hundreds, or 2000s. But then the subprime mortgage meltdown proved that, you know maybe it’s not always the best idea. Real estate can go down. And I think the hard thing is, people say, Yeah, but you know, real estate, you know, essentially, everyone needs somewhere to live, and it’s historically, the value of real estate is always going to go up forever. Now people say that the tricky thing is the pace of monetary inflation is around 15%. The best thing is to either chat Gpt or Google The M2 Money Supply. And essentially what you will find isthat the money supply is essentially a metric in which the Us. Government, or any other government on the planet, includes the euro and stuff. They keep printing more currency. And the reason why then this becomes an issue is that if you have more currency in the system that means the individual value of each unit is going to go down. I call this the shake Shack Burger incident. So me and Seneca we used to always buy a single burger, patty, for $1.49, $1.50 … and one day we come and they say no it is $2.50, a party. Why this makes no sense is like, yeah, we just increased the minimum wage to $20 an hour from $15 an hour. $20 an hour for fast food, and the hard thing is with minimum wage. You cannot rewind the the hands of time. If you suddenly said that the minimum wage is only $17 an hour, there will be riots. The streets would not be not be good. So we’re all photographers, you know, street photographers, whatever. And the hard thing with digital is in our minds, digital is infinite and free. So, for example, I could take a copy of Mozart’s 5th Symphony, or whatever, as an mp3, file, and I could copy and distribute it a trillion times with 0 marginal cost right? So this is where the notion of cyber becomes more interesting. And I’ll think about like, you know, cyber punk thinking about cyber truck. It’s essentially once again, mathematically, cryptographically, that the hard science and the hard math is there can never be more than 21 million coinsin existence come up forever. Even if you took all the quantum ultra computers on the planet, times it by 20, you still could not produce more bitcoins. It’s just how it works right? One Bitcoin is like one cyber-ox, and it’s immortable, immortal, indestructible. It’ll give you life forever. And there’s only gonna be 21 million of them in the future. And now and so this is your chance to get one for an extreme discount. Let’s even say let’s say you want to buy a single family home. Let’s say it costs a million euros or whatever. Right? So if I could tell you today that you could buy a single family home for only $100,000 or €100,000 you’d be like, wow, that’s that’s the deal of a century. That’s you’re still getting a 90% discount. And my personal thought is Bitcoin is far more valuable than real estate, because in the next 20-30 years, when essentially all the all the baby boomers, The Gen. Xers die off, and it’s the millennials and Gen. Z’s. And, alphas! When we millennials take over, what’s interesting is that we don’t really care about physical real estate anymore. We will care about digital cyber real estate which is bitcoin. ￼￼ So my personal story, how did I get into Bitcoin? So it might seem a little bit random. It’s like, Okay, ERIC, you’re super famous for photography, street photography like, how do you get to Bitcoin like? It’s like, so random, right? But actually, it’s not very random at all, because, you know, if you’ve been following me carefully, you know the whole time, I’ve always been talking about living minimalistically, frugally, Spartan lifestyle, whatever’s. And you know now that you know I’m pretty stacked with a bitcoin and microstrategy stock mstr. Funny enough, I’ve personally found that my lifestyle habits haven’t changed much after getting super rich, I mean, I’m a little bit more generous, maybe, like, you know, took out a friend last night to all you eat Korean barbecuepaid for her bill didn’t really even flinch. Even a random aside, my best friend and my best man Justin, told me this when we were like in our early 20s, when we finally got good paying jobs whatever, is that the greatest joy is being able to eat out and not really feel the pain associated with having to eat out because we both grew up poor. ￼ I still remember even when I was undergraduate at UCLA, after our KYRIE club meeting, we would all go out to eat, and then I would see all the other guys ordering these really expensive $15 Korean barbecue gogi plates, (this was in 2006, when you could still buy a foot-long sub sandwich for five bucks￼), and $1.99 tacos, and $1 tacos, and me trying to save money, would force myself not to eat even though I was hungry, and my friends would ask me if I was hungry and I would lie, and say I wasn’t, while my stomach was still grumbling. ￼ So my personal thought with Bitcoin is, I personally wanted monetary freedom, and so long story short, so I’ll never forget this moment. So I’m born 1988. Went to UCLA as an undergrad — my roommate at the time, Kevin. It’s our junior he’s on Reddit, and I’ll never forget we’re in our studio apartment. I think I was distracted. I was doing something else. He was like Eric, you know. He’s on some subreddit, and he’s like. “Oh, Eric, this thing called Bitcoin, and there’s this one dude who just bought two domino’s pizzas for like 10,000 bitcoins. We should just get like a hundred bucks worth of bitcoin, and just see what happens.” I then responded “￼Eh, seems like a scam” and disregarded it. No this is one bitcoin was like less than a penny, so even if me and Kevin and my roommate Kevin, just bought a hundred bitcoins at the time for funsies, right? And I had a hundred bucks right? We would each be worth at least 1.2 billion dollars. If I had bought $100 worth of bitcoin at the time, once again we would each have about $1.2 billion in our checking accounts. Today, I’m like, man. This was like the worst mistake of my life, right? But everything has happened as it should have happened. You know. Maybe if I had become a billionaire I’d just become some degenerate, you know. Cocaine addict on some beach somewhere in in Hawaii, and then Seneca would never been born. I would have never done my photography, world travels, whatevers. Then my reintroduction to Bitcoin was kind of more recently when moving to LA. The cost of living is so expensive, and you know every I don’t know a single person who doesn’t want financial freedom. A long story short, I 1st heard about Bitcoin again, kind of earlier than when I was living in Vietnam around 2017, 2018, and at the time I didn’t really need Bitcoin, because our living expenses were so cheap. It was $320 bucks a month for a brand new studio apartment, fully furnished up, uplighting and the jazz right? And even at the time, passively, the income we’re making. Let’s say it’s a $1000- $2,000 a month. Let’s say it’s not even that much right, but like our whole total expenses, living expenses like maybe $600-700 a month, so I had the epiphany I’m like, I’m never going to run out of money. So already, at the age of 26 in my mind, I mentally retired rightand just more for funsies. I met this guy named Bing in Singapore. Heard about this thing called Digibyte. Dgb, I don’t even think they’re around anymore. But at the time I’m like, Okay, I want to buy some bitcoins, buy some digibyte. How do I do this? And at the time Coinbase seemed like the best option, because it was the simplest, most minimalist to me it looked like the paypal for for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. For fun I bought about $25,000 worth of bitcoin, which, and Bitcoin was only about $7,000, $6,999 a bitcoin. So that was around 3.5 bitcoins. ￼ I then traded some bitcoin for digibyte, and I kept some bitcoin in my Coinbase account. Then the next few years I essentially saw the waves and the crashes and the dogecoins and stuff like that. And essentially, I just kind of woke up to my guts and found out that Bitcoin was a real deal. Some strange analogies is to me Bitcoin is almost like a newWorld economic religion, I mean, people who follow Bitcoin are like fanatic. They’re zealous about it. They follow Michael Saylor like he’s like you know the prophet. You know the next prophet of Bitcoin right? And it’s always good to invest in religions or to invest in cults like the cult of Tesla, Elon Musk apple, Steve Jobs. Whatevs, right? Now obviously, I have financial independence now, and the only reason I’m teaching this workshop or sharing this information is, I almost feel like it’s my ethical imperative. Once again, if you could have discovered internet in the early days, or clean drinking water, I would feel that it would almost be a disservice if I did not share this information with others. So everyone’s always about like, okay, so what is the Bitcoin gonna be worth? So there’s the open source model. Michael Saylor, I think, helped create it. It’s called the Bitcoin 21 model, I think. Right? So 21 years from now his base case is that Bitcoin is going to be $13 million a Bitcoin. Bear case, $3 million a Bitcoin. The bull case is $49 million a Bitcoin, and note, this was in 2024 in July before Trump was announced as President, and he is ultra super pro crypto and bitcoin and also worth following, is his son Eric Trump, ironically. His name is also Eric also the funny thing. There’s a bunch of Eric’s actually in the world of Bitcoin, Eric Kim Eric Semler, of semler scientific, this other Etf guy who works for Bloomberg. His name is Eric Balconus, or something like that. Essentially, we have an all Republican trump, pro bitcoin pro crypto, President and cabinet, whatever right? What is really fascinating about Michael Saylor’s predictions for the future price of bitcoin is that when it was only $65,000 a bitcoin, and we were a bit uncertain about what the future of bitcoin and the president and the government would look like. The last four years, we were all fighting an uphill battle, because the former administration was adamantly anti-crypto and anti-bitcoin. Gary Gensler who seems like a smart guy, was for some reason really anti-bitcoin and crypto? ￼￼ And so these were all written by Michael Saylor’s predictions before we had the most pro bitcoingovernment of all time. So all these numbers, I think, should be inflated. So my personal thought is, I think, for the next 4 years once Trump takes office, January 20, 2025. I think this will be the craziest, best Bitcoin Bull Run of all time the next 4 years. So currently, Bitcoin’s been going up around 60% to 62% arr annual rate of return. And I think once Trump takes office, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna buy the 1 million Bitcoins, or whatever for the strategic American Reserve. And also I think Eric Trump, his son, is committed to having Bitcoin be at least a million in Bitcoin. So let’s see. So my personal prediction, right? So I think Bitcoin will grow by at least 120% arr over the next 4 years. So let’s say, Bitcoin is worth around $100,000 right now. So by next year, let’s say it’s $250,000 the year after that, let’s say it’s $750,000, let’s say the year after that it’s like $1.2 million. So I think we’re on track to hit a million a bitcoin in 4 years about 10x gain. So just do the math from then. Currently as an account measure, I now equate one bitcoin being worth one cyber truck, assuming that a cyber truck is currently around $100,000. So the smart strategy is to take your hundred thousand dollars and invest it into bitcoin today, and you’ll see that becoming $1 million in four years. ￼ What that means is sell your cyber truck for $100,000, buy bitcoin, otherwise you have just done spent $1 million on your cyber loser truck. Now, people are always asking, okay, this, you know, Bitcoin reserve strategy, you know, like, how is? And why is America going to buy the Bitcoins? Right? So we’re essentially out of physical land and real estate. Now we have to go to cyberspace right? And it seems kind of silly, like something out of a sci-fi film. But the truth is, they’re currently the war we’re having with China and Russia. It’s it’s not physical war per se. It’s actually cyber war. So cyber security is the big big money maker. Even cyber penetration testing. Right? I think Gmail is trying to get like all these malicious actors trying to attack the Gmail servers like a million times a minute. Something crazy, right? And if you look at the history of America, right? So, Manhattan, 1600s, the price of Manhattan. It was essentially stolen from the natives. Right? 60 guilders, right Louisiana purchase, you know, to fund Napoleon, California. Also kind of stolen from the the local Mexicans right? And also Alaska right. The the payoff was great, right, and so essentially the Bitcoin Act, the Cynthia Lummis Bill, she’s trying to get the States to buy at least a million bitcoins right? And you know even a Michael Saylor is much more aggressive. He’s like no America should at least purchase maybe 5 or 6 million bitcoins, which is 20 to 25% of the whole Bitcoin supply. And all America has to do is a free trade. They just need to sell their gold and then buy Bitcoin. And in a recent interview that I was listening from Saylor.super fascinating, is like essentially what he said was the super evil genius strategy of America selling her gold reserves and buying Bitcoin is that if that’s the case,we demonetize our enemies. You know, gold capital reserves. So then suddenly, the the gold of the Russians, the Chinese, will go to 0, and then everyone’s going to rush into Bitcoin. And if America owns Bitcoin, it’s a good sign for the future. And also another big thing I want to talk about. Why does America have the best economy on the planet?So we essentially gave birth to Apple Amazon, Facebook, the magnificent 7 stocks, Netflix. And you know, people talk about China. It’s like. Okay, I don’t know a single rich mainland Chinese oligarch who doesn’t want to send their kids to the States to Harvard or Yale or Princeton, you know, buy a nice house in Palo Alto, the Bay area, or even Vancouver. No rich mainland Chinese person actually wants to be in China, but because of capital controls, they’re kind of stuck. So once there’s going to be a mad rush to Bitcoin. That means that you, your family, your whole squad, is going to prosper now. My friend Dante had a question about storage. So I think the hard thing with storage is okay. So how do you say this?This is my personal philosophy. The reason I do not personally trust cold storage for myself or more of these self custody options is that I know that I am very forgetful, and my biggest fear is, let’s say, I forget my passcode, or whatever is right to the Bitcoins. And or let’s say, my kids, kids can forget it right? Then boom like, you’re gonna be out like a hundred 1 million dollars. Right? So that’s that’s not fun, right? And so personally, I think the easiest is to just, you know, store it on the cloud. So, using a trusted custodian, whether it be coinbase. I think fidelity has their own services now. And the you know honestly, it seems like Coinbase is probably the best option,,, coinbase.com, or you just download your iphone ipad. Whatever right is that you could also get a link with your biometric apple id data, whether it be face id or thumbprint. Whatevs right? So this way, it just feels much more secure. So for me, I would prefer an 80 to 85% optimal thing that is kind of dummy proof rather than take the 100% secure option which, because of user error, I might fail, and something that I personally learned is in terms of technology. And all these things in betweenseeking the simplest, most straightforward optionthat is least complicated is often the best solution. And the reason I would be very, very wary of a lot of these people promoting, you know, buying their hardware wallets. Whatever right, everyone has a buck to make. Everyone has a bitcoin to make. Everyone wants to make a few satoshis here and there. So they’re trying to fear monger us. Oh, you’re gonna you know, Coinbase going to get hacked. And I’m like, no, I don’t think it is. It’s like, you know, back. It’s like essentially a Us. Government backed institution, you know, it’s essentially it’s traded on the the the US Stock Exchange. It’s a American based company. I would not trust anything outside of the States. If you’re super, you know, quant genius, autistic genius, then do all the cold storage stuff. But if in doubt, just the simplest thing is, coinbase seems to be the best. Okay, so this is kind of my free money hack. So I call this microstrategy, strategy, mstr microstrategy versus bitcoin. And okay, so it’s very, very simple. So this becomes a philosophical debate. To say it short.I think the ultimate goal is to own Bitcoin, he or she, or the entities which own the most Bitcoin shall win. And so for me, philosophically, you know, let us say that you could own, you know, 20 bitcoins, or you could own 2 million dollars worth of micro strategy. Mstr. Stock. Right?10-20, 30 years from now, right? With MSTR you’re going to actually outperform Bitcoin. You’re actually going to make more money from microstrategy stock than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin, historically, has been 60% to 62% ARR annual rate of return MicroStrategy is almost double that 120 to 125 ARR. So if you actually want to maximize your returns, you just buy microstrategy stock mstr. The issues is, you know let us say that Michael Saylor gets shot. He gets killed. He dies in a Cybertruck self driving accident whatever. Right? Then, it’s probably not going to be the world’s best future for microstrategy. So it’s actually much more risky. If you want the least risky option, just put all your money into Bitcoin. And some millennial living strategies. Right? So the the simplest strategy I have, I call it the Spartan strategy. This is why I personally follow. Is you essentially try to live as minimally and frugally and sparse as you can, and just put literally 90% of your income into bitcoin. And a free money hack I discovered. So, for example, let’s say you have $150,000 or €150,000. Right? And you know I’m not 100% sure how it works if you’re a European. Anyways what you do is you buy microstrategy stock. So let’s say you buy, you know, $100,000 or $150,000 worth of it right? And Mstr, and you use fidelity, or robinhood, or whatever trading app you have. Right. And the strategy is simple. Let us say the base case is $150,000. Let’s say your microstrategy stock value then goes up to $200,000. Right?You sell $50,000 worth of it, and then you just transfer that to your bank account, and then your bank account is linked with your coinbase account. Then you just buy the Bitcoin — rinse and repeat. So very, very impressive over the last 3 months, I started with initial seed capital of around $150,000 in microstrategy stock, off of that $150,000 right and I haven’t even touched my principal. I yielded $242,000off of that initial $150,000. Once again I didn’t touch any of my principal. So essentially I made a free $240,000 dollars … in just 3 months! And also for traditional Roth, Roth, Ira retirement accounts. I put everything into microstrategy stock, and it had already like 3x’d. For example, My roth, Ira, just kind of randomly was like was $78,000, and then the course of 3 months it’s like now, $230,000. It peaked at around $300,000. So it’s going to be a good future. So the the very simple strategy– cut and reduce your expenses to a bare minimum. ￼So let us say you’re able to get down your living expenses to let’s say you know, $5,000 bucks a month or €5,000 a month. Right? the point isn’t to just make a bunch of money and just go out and buy the Lambo. The the goal is actually to continue to live frugally. If anything live more frugally. So the funny paradox here is that when people say they want to become a millionaire, but they’re really mean to say is I want to spend $1 million. ￼ But the funny thing is the second you go out and you spend $1 million, you then become worth zero dollars. So actually, the game then is to stack your capital indefinitely and to see your numbers go up forever. And then the hilarious thing assuming that you’re like some sort of greedy money rich person, you actually continue to live as frugally as possible, and not touch your capital. ￼￼￼ I think one of the wise ways to think about money is like heat loss. For example, if you’re super effing cold, do you want to seal up the window windows and the spots of your house which loses heat. The same thing is with money and capital. You want to stop the capital loss. ￼So for example, the number one thing is the whole vehicle thing!￼ Never ever ever ever ever purchase any vehicle that requires premium gas. This is like the stupidest mistake of all time.￼ You continue driving your old Toyota Prius, and just pour all of your money in Bitcoin, because really the truth is and this is my philosophical thought is, there’s almost nothing worth on the planet purchasing.Besides, Bitcoin is my philosophical thought. The only thing worth purchasing on the planet is bitcoin. ￼ ￼Also some even more super smart economic leverage. Instead of paying an arm and a leg for rent in La or New York. Brooklyn, you just move to like Southeast Asia. So if you move to Southeast Asia, you can live like a king, for like $300-500 bucks a month. Right? You just put all your money to Bitcoin. So even if you had a modest savings, right, let’s say you had like $200,000, and you have microstrategy stock.Let’s say every month of the month is rent is due, and the expenses are due right? You just sell a small portion of that stock, and it’s going to go up. So my thought on the next 4 years, microstrategy, assuming it’s around 2x Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is going to go up 120% ARR. I think microstrategy is going to double that 240% ARR. So just do the math. At the end of every single month in which expenses are due, let us say it’s like $1000 bucks or something… You just sell $1000 worth of bitcoin or microstrategy stock to just afford your lifestyle. ￼ But ultimately my personal thought is whatever excess, money and capital you have just put it onto Bitcoin. So the microstrategy then ends up becoming the engine or the turbocharger or the cash cow. You milk it, and you shave the cream off the top, and then you buy Bitcoin with it. So I think the reason why to me Bitcoin is such a fascinating thing, and very exciting, is essentially Bitcoin is digital photography. Peter Diamandis, the X prize guy. Right? You know, he talks a lot about kodak film. You know the iphone and disruption.So actually, intuitively, as photographers and digital photographers, we should actually understand bitcoin. You know, this disruptive power about digital photography. So obviously, you have the hipsters with their mustaches and their flannels, you know, talking about the virtues of film photography. But the truth is, digital photography is like a quadrillion times better than film photography. And also currently, in the year 2025, incomingdigital photography is actually superior to film photography. In the early days of digital ,,, digital photography sucked. But now, at this point, digital photography is far superior to any sort of film photography, and the only reason you should shoot film in today’s world is either as like a practice to appreciate the joys of photography. So the philosophical approach. Or you know, you’re trying to be some sort of like, you know, snobby fine art photographer and overcharge money for your photos. Then you shoot film.Because honestly, the the fine art market, they’re always going to overvalue film photos over digital photos, because it’s more complicated. It’s more strange, right? So in the art, in the art world, the more complicated, abstruse, and complicated, you can make your art the better. But for us,where we care about practical things, yeah, think about Bitcoin. So think about the iphone iphone pro versus your mom’s kodak Browning camera. I think the the thought is obvious. Okay. Very simple. Just download the coinbase app. Buy Bitcoin. If you don’t want to actually own Bitcoin, you just want to make a ton of money, just buy microstrategy stock MSTR, and use your traditional accounts. And I still think that this is the biggest thing is that everyone wants to become a millionaire, right?But you know what I think people want to do isthey don’t want to earn like, okay, okay.people want to spend a million dollars.They don’t want to actually save and build a million dollars right? And so if you think about, you know, money andcapital digital capital, I think about like Lego bricks, right? I just went to Legoland. Senecall is great. So let us say thateach bitcoin, or dollar or 1 million dollars like these. Let’s say these are Lego bricks right? The goal is, you want to build your Lego Tower brick thing as tall as possible. You don’t ever want toget rid of your bricks and throw into the trash. That’s essentially what consumerism is. And this is actually another big philosophical thing I discovered is, what’s the difference between capitalism and consumerism. Consumerism is actually the exact opposite of capitalism. Capitalism is about accumulating wealth.building your capital and not spend it right. Even one of my favorite Kanye quotes is like why people make money don’t spend it. But I’d rather buy 80 gold chains go ignorant, right ignorant. And so the pernicious thing that happens in a lot of communities, especially poor communities. Right? I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes. Right?Happens to Korean people. It happens to everybody, right? Is that you know you live in a crappy apartment in K. Town with 20 other dudes. Yet you drive the brand new Bmw. And you’re not building any sort of generational wealth. Right? And so essentially, yeah, you want to build the capital and not spend it. And essentially, you want to start to intelligently leverage your capitalto give to your future kids or your descendants, or whatever you want to do. Now, the hardest thing about Bitcoin is stomaching the volatility so volatile, mean. Just it goes up, it goes down, and then, like honestly for most people, it’s going to give them like 5. 100 heart attacks over right nowI think of a Bitcoin kind of like nuclear energy, sonuclear energy in the untamed formed is obviously toxic could cause the next Fukushima whatevers right? But if you have a bunch of smart people, engineers, nuclear physicists working in a controlled manner, right? It’s like the greatest benefit to society, because to humanity, because essentially, you’re giving people free electricity forever. Right? AndI think my personal thought is the volatility is a future not above. So the reason why Bitcoin goes up and down the sideways so much all the time, and you can have huge swingsis because you could trade a 24, 7, 365 on the weekends in the evenings. Right?It still befuddles me that in the year 2024, 2025 like. Why is it that you know, after 5 pm. You know Eastern time, or on the weekend Saturday, Sunday like, why did they close the market? So what if there’s another Cuban missile crisis. It makes no sense right?And also the reason why it’s so volatile is that it’s actually the mostdesirable commodity on the planet. And there’s all these people with these weird Bloomberg machine terminals, whatever they are, always pegging everything to the Bitcoin. So a lot of people ask about ethereum dogecoin webs, right. I think Bitcoin is the only true.Everything else is the false prophets. Everything else is the false coins. The immaculate conception of Bitcoin and Satoshi.I think this is actually a big deal, because anything that is not Bitcoin, you know, ethereum and the like. They they need some sort of spokesperson, or, you know, individual to prop up the value right, whereas Satoshi, he invented it, he disappeared forever. Now the reason why this is such a big deal is thatevery other crypto thing which is not Bitcoin.It does not have a hard caplike you could print more ethereums. You could print more. Whatever tokens you cannot print more bitcoins, and that’s that’s the big thought.So. Volatility is vitality. Eric Kim. I actually didn’t say that. Sorry. That was actually Michael Saylor. I typed that in wrong. But essentiallyyou know, volatility is vitality, and the more volatile the more energy the power you have, the more vitality you have. So once again, people think of volatility as being risk. That is actually not the case. Bitcoin is going to go up forever, but it’s going to be like an extreme roller coaster and go up down, but with extreme swings it’s extreme performance. Soyeah, volatility is not risk. Volatility is just going up and down a lot, but essentially over a long enough time span. It’s going to go up forever.So I borrowed a lot of slides quite liberally from Michael Saylor. Some of these are from his recent Microsoft. Pitch. And yeah, just go. michael.com go to his presentations looking at yourself. So I’ll just make some quick points. Soessentially, currently, Bitcoin is like a 2 trillion dollar asset class right? And this is also from Jesse Myers once in a species.com. And the reason why this is important is currently you know. Let us say the whole world’s economy is 900 trillion dollars, right? Andwhat we have our eyes on is real estate. So real estate is, you know, most people don’t really just use real estate as a place to live right? Otherwise, you just rent. People use it for a long term store of value. So, for example, if you’re a really really rich family from New York City, you own, like 10 square blocks in Manhattan, and, you know, does your descendants sell, you know.a square block to buy himself a few Ferraris. No, that that would be a bad strategy. So the the tip I have for any single person trying to build intergenerational wealth. Keep it simple. Only one rule. You don’t sell the Bitcoin. If you face extreme poverty or financial distress, I don’t know. Become an Uber driver or something. Pay the bills, but don’t sell the Bitcoin.and currently I think we’re going to see is Bitcoin is just going to take over the gold market, which is 16 trillion dollars, maybe the cars and collectible art market.Now, a big thought is this is from Michael Saylor once again, is thatall these assets on the planet.Some of half of it is to provide utility. Right? So, for example, you know.let’s say you need you need somewhere to live right? No so that provides utility right? But then, again, some of it is to preserve capital right? Andas a 36 year old millennial nowadays. The pressures. Oh, you got to buy a single family home today, right? But the the reason I get so sus of people saying you should buy a house is that they’re like, oh, you essentially need somewhere to live. You’ll build capital. Blah! Blah, right? You don’t want to give money to land, but it’s like no, you only need one reason like you would only ever buy a single family house. If let’s say you really like having a backyard and a garage, or what is right. But it’s really nota money making thing, because homeownership is like a trillion, times more expensive than you would otherwise think, and as a consequence, with a single family home, even if the price is going up rightat best, you might be breaking, even if not, you know, slowly bleeding yourself. Because, let’s say, real estate is on average, going up 10% a year, right? The money supply the inflationary. M 2 supply is 15% a year. So you’re actually kind of losing money.So the big thought is once again, you know.the optimistic thought is eventually all these long term sort of things are going to become digital capital. I still think about this, the Warren Buffett. They’re all gonna die. And then, when we, you know, take the take the mantle. What’s gonna happen the next 20 years, even if you’re 80 years old right now? 81 years old. Shout out.You know, I think I’m optimistic. We could live to be 100 20. So yeah, this is definitely the next wave. You’re not going to want to miss right? And you know, currently a lot of millennials. People like everyone wants to buy the Lambo or the Ferrari.You’re you’re going to lose the value of it in about 3 years. You want to live forever.So these are some kind of conservative growth estimates, according to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin 24 model. So in about 21 years, and this was still pretty conservative. Right? Bitcoin is going to become a 280 trillion dollar, you know thing right? So going from 2 trillion to 200 trillion, so at least 10 x. So you’re conservatively, you’re going to see your money at least 10 x in 21 years, which is pretty cool. Right? It’s not going to take over all these other things. It might, but it might not.Now people always ask.what is Bitcoin backed by? So I did the maths right and based on what other people say, too essentially the Bitcoin network. If you took all the apple Amazon aws servers, Meta.combine them all times 20, you could still not hack the Bitcoin network in in terms of the raw power that goes into powering. Think about like 20 nuclear power reactors powering the thing right? And also people don’t understand is there’s already been 850 billion dollars of quote, real money investment thing follow Blackrock. They just recently recommended most of theiryou know, owners to allocate at least 2% of their portfolio into Bitcoin, which is kind of a big deal. Look about what Larry Fink says. Blackrock is like what they own. What 40 trillion dollars of assets around the planet. They’re they’re kind of a big deal. And also it’s a network effect. So you remember, in the early days of Facebook. It was only it was only university students with the Edu address were allowed to join in. Then they opened up to everybody, and the network effect of Facebook is thatif you have Facebook and I have Facebook, then Facebook instantly becomes more valuable to both of us, because I can now share my photos with you, whatever’s right. But then, if your friends friends also have Facebook, it becomes much more valuable to everything. Same thing goes with facetime right. The reason why I got you know I used to be a Diehard android dude. Now I’m like all icloud everything. It makes life so much easier. You get your mom an iphone. Now you get facetime imessage. It makes life way better.And so Bitcoin is going to be the same thing as more and more people are going to continue to download Coinbase or Whatevs. And also my optimistic thought is, if Apple doesn’t want to become irrelevant, it’s I’m very certain the next 5 to 10 years. Apple is going to have their ownBitcoin storage thing in your icloud account. It makes sense right. They have apple pay. They have the apple wallet. Essentially.apple is the new bank. And so now, when they do like a you know, a 3 device authentication for your bitcoins through your iphone, your ipad and your macbook pro whatevers.It’s actually it might actually be one of the most safe ways to store your bitcoins.Also things to think about. If you’re a traditional investorso there’s this notion called the cost to capital cost to capital that Michael Saylor says a lot. I might be getting this wrong. Butessentially the S. And P. 500 right?on average, is like 14 to 15% return year over year. Right? So if you’re not making at least 15% or over 15% a year, you’re essentially losing your bleeding money. So real estate gold bonds is kind of a losing bet, right? And so the magnificent 7 which all the big tech stocks 28%, a little bit better, right? But look at Bitcoin. It’s like 62% year over year. And it’s kind of the obvious bet, right?And even if you think about you know, everyone’s talking about Nvidia Tesla. You know what is right.I think the reason why the mainstream media they don’t like to talk about micro strategy is that it’s still a little bit too weird and bizarre. And it’s not as buzzworthy as AI, because, okay, people like to think of this like evil Terminator AI, the video going to take over the world and find it right. But nobody is like Bitcoin, likeBitcoin is not an android walking around 2 feet, taking over the planet right? So people actually don’t like to talk about Bitcoin. And for so long people thought that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme right. No one ever thought that AI was a Ponzi scheme. So the video always catches the headlines. But look at microstrates, look at the best performing stock on the human unit in the human universeover 3 x. That of Nvidia, which is already impressive, and Nvidia is already destroying Tesla by a massive margin as well. Right? SoI mean? That’s that’s pretty obvious, right?Even Donald Trump watches a Nashville presentation. He quotes Michael Saylor directly, says, Never sell your Bitcoin. Apparently Eric Trump, the son of Donald Trump has known Michael Saylor for 20 years. I’m not sure if that’s true or not, but if that’s the case.I’m like a hundred percent certain that. You know, Michael Saylor essentially has the left ear of Donald Trump.And yeah, it’s it’s a it’s a very good thing.So if you want to plug and create your own models. Google, the Bitcoin, 24 model. It’s on Githubplug in your own assumptions.And this is the big thing that I have my eyes set on. So currently, you know, it’s December right? And everyone’s waiting for the trump to get into the office January 20.th So this is a tricky thing. So I used to be Super Anti Donald Trump, right? Because I could care less about politics and stuff like that right? Andbutone Donald Trump became super super pro bitcoin. I started to listen and start watching all his interviews and looking like honestly the you know, I’m from the Bay Area like Liberal Democrat, my whole life right? And actually, I kind of realized, wow, the the left leaning media is kind of the they’re kind of the evil ones here. And Donald Trump, he seems actually kind of like a cool, nice nice nice guy, right?And the big thought is.there’s no, there’s not going to be a World war 3. What is right? And Bitcoin, under the trump administration is gonna explode, and it’s gonna be thethe greatest 4 years of prosperity of all time, and this once again coming from like a super left leaning liberal. So this is a good thought so. Anyways. Let us say, you know.America leads the charge in the crypto Bitcoin revolution. Right? And yeah, I thinkassuming that America really wants to control the future. I think the America purchasing 6 million bitcoins is not fully out of this this planet. Right?So some thoughts on building personal family wealth.So the reason why I think this is kind of a big deal is thateveryone wants to build wealth right. Everyone wants to be intelligent with their investing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a nonprofit, a charity, a church, Mother Teresa, like every single organization, will always need money. Capital. If you have an endowment, you know, for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford Brown University. Whatever even the Uc. Is right, everyone needs money and capital right.and I don’t like to think too much about the macro, because I’m not an institutional investor. I just think about myself, my family, my best friends, my squad. Right? So the goal is building personal family wealth and how to intelligently invest. So a lot of people talk about timings. Oh, when should I buy Bitcoin? Should I time it the high. Then people take out these charts and these candlesticks, which is all just witchcraft and pseudoscience don’t follow any of that.Essentially the thought is.anytime is a good time to buy Bitcoin if it’s high, low, Middle, whatever. We’re going to keep buying the top forever. So recently I bought some more Bitcoin at $100,000. Right then it dipped down to 90,000 to 88,000 hit 103,000 again, and so I’m pretty sure that in 1020 years I’m going to be buying Bitcoin at 1 million, a Bitcoin, 10 million dollars a Bitcoin, 55 million dollars a Bitcoin, whatever is right, and because if you do the simple math, just think at least 4 years ahead, right? So if I could tell you with 100 certainty that Bitcoin is going to be 1.2 million a Bitcoinin 4 yearsas long as you’re buying it for less than a million dollars a coin. You’re going to be in the green like it’s it’s kind of a a good bet, right? And actually, also, ironically, my personal thought ischasing gains is a good thing, but also it’s it’s a good idea to not get quote greedy in the sense of maximizing your gains. So so, for example, right like, what’s the difference between getting a 38% yield and a 32% yield like the the difference is nominal. Don’t don’t worry so much about maximization, because even a lot of what I thought my trades were bad2 years ago ended up being right. So as investors, we have to think at least 410-20-3040 years ahead of us. So don’t worry so much about the the short termso practical and pragmatic investing strategies right? So once again, so if I had a simple blueprint, sosome some simple thoughts.there’s lots of different blends. You could do this, you could. You could be super simple. Just 100 to Bitcoin, buy it on Coinbase what is right, and just keep stacking forever.100 legitimate. That’s the Bitcoin Maximus opposed the triple, triple Maxi, the triple Maximalist approach. If you just need to pay the bills whatever, and still stack the Bitcoins. My personal suggestion is put 80% of your wealth into Bitcoin and 20% of your wealth into micro strategy Mstr stock. And once again. This is this is what you do. So let’s say, for simplicity of math. Let’s sayLet’s say you have a million dollars or a hundred $1,000, or you use whatever kind of a number you want, right? So put 20% that to microstrategy stock whenever it goes upbeyond the principal, sell some of that stock and put that into micro strategies. Sorry. Put that into Bitcoin, and or use that money to just pay your your bills. So once again what I personally did right?$150,000 working capital into micro strategy Mstr stock. And let’s say, when it goes from worth $150,000 to $160,000. I’ll sell $10,000 worth that stock. That $10,000 gets deposited to my checking account, which is linked to my coinbase. Then I’ll just buy $10,000 worth of bitcoin right? Or, if you need that, $10,000for living expenses. Let’s sayyou need $3,000 to pay your rent. You take $3,000 of that to pay your rent, and you put the other 7% of that into Bitcoin.also some other definition. What’s the difference between being an investor, a trader versus speculator?So an investor, we want to be investors. We want to think about (102) 030-4050 years ahead of us. A trader is a bunch of these, like 20 year old. High testosterone degenerates, you know, single, you know, maybe addicted drugs, or whatever right, who just want to like look cool. I made a billion dollars in a month by using all these complicatedstatistical models. Blah! Blah! Right? But you don’t. You don’t want to be a trader because essentially it’snobody could time the market. Not even God could time the market right. And what a speculator is people who invest in meme coins. So a meme coin is like buying a Dogecoin or shiba Inu, that the reason why these are not you should not do this is that it is extremely dangerous. You’re going to lose all your money, and it requiresa charismatic leader to support it. So Dogecoin, right? Dogecoin is essentially elon musk coin right?But if one day Elon musk tweets. Ha! Ha! Doge was just a joke all along, right. It’s not worth anything. The value of it will pump it to 0, or if once again. Elon dies in a you know a robo taxi accident. The value of dogecoin is going to go to 0, whereas if Elon Musk dies, you know Bitcoin is going to still keep going up forever. So speculator is meme coins beyond bitcoin us Bitcoiners. We’re we’re investors.So you know, somebody also asked about, you know, monetary inflation right? So there’s this thing called the M. 2 monetary supply of the the rate rate inflation.And once again you’re going to have to exceed at least 13% to 15% tonot lose money. So, for example, let us say, you have a billion dollars of us dollars in your checking account. Right? You’re going to be bled to death. Right? So in a year, your 1 billion dollar is going to shrink to 750 million down to 500 million, to 350 million. And essentially, you’re going to get a point where your money is worthless.And already we see this right now. So currently, the price of real estate, single family homes is exploding. But this is my critical view. How much of that is that the value of a single family house is higher versus our Us. Dollars are just simply worthless. Right? So if you just do the same simple maths, right?So let us say that. You know, minimum wage goes from $15 an hour to $20 an hour overnight for Mcdonald’s worker. Right? That means instantly. You see, 25% inflation. So your 1 million dollars in the bank is now worth only 750$1,000. So yeah, once again. The real real rich people. They store less than 1% of their wealth inUs. Dollars in their checking account like, you’re not gonna have Jeff Bezos bragging to other people that he has 10 billion dollars of us dollars in their checking account. No, it’s it’s all going to be in you know, stocks, or, you know, real estate. And actually, ideally, Bitcoin. Cyber cyber capital.So yeah, that’s that’s essentially the the end of my presentation. When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: Commercial Observer Breakthrough Awards Prove Momentum of CRE’s Comeback

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy As Marc Norman, associate dean of NYU’s SPS Schack Institute of Real Estate, kicked off the proceedings for Commercial Observer’s second annual Breakthrough Awards Breakfast, he neatly summarized the depth of the challenges faced by all those nominated for these awards — and, for that matter, for all who endeavor to close deals and create new properties in an industry that has been besieged by obstacles in recent years. “The deals nominated today represent for me and our students at Schack an amazing series of case studies in how complex transactions get done in a dynamic political, policy, and economic environment,” said Norman. “The structure of this event is something I love, because it shows us excellence across all asset classes and sectors, deal sizes, and financing types. This crew of finalists represents a kind of best-in-class, and shows us the way in innovating and moving forward in a very tough market — really the toughest market — New York City.” And this, illustrating the resilience and ingenuity at the heart of the industry, is in many ways the primary purpose of the Breakthrough Awards. “Our Commercial Observer Breakthrough Awards have become an important way of recognizing and celebrating the critical deals, transactions, projects and teams that are leading the industry forward despite market challenges,” said Observer Media CEO James Freiman. “In a challenging economic landscape, it’s easy to get distracted by the many hurdles the industry faces, but each of the Breakthrough Award finalists and winners have demonstrated best-in-class work and the innovation and ingenuity needed to overcome those obstacles.” The prestige of these awards had a clear and marked impact on all those nominated. “Knowing that Rosenberg & Estis is recognized along with other top-notch law firms as one of the elite firms representing the real estate industry, in what is a very competitive business and in the world’s most competitive city, is at the same time gratifying and humbling,” said Michael E. Lefkowitz, managing member at Rosenberg & Estis, one of the evening’s nominees for Law Firm of the Year. “These types of industry recognition events are excellent opportunities to showcase Rosenberg & Estis’ talents, and well as to get to know a bit more about the amazing achievements and successes of other players in the real estate industry.” Kicking off the evening’s deals and transactions segment, the night’s first award, for Retail Transaction of the Year, went to Kushner, Fortress Investment Group, GreenBarn Investment Group, and Rithm Capital for their $415 million financing of Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, N.J. The financing will be used to transform the former mall into an open-air town center featuring 900,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space. “I want to thank our partners Fortress and GreenBarn on our amazing Monmouth Square project in Eatontown,” said Kushner CEO Laurent Morali. “And to our amazing team at Kushner, represented here by so many, I love all of you and I love working with all of you. Thank you so much.” Industrial Transaction of the Year was awarded to Turnbridge Equities, Dune and Cushman & Wakefield for Otto Environmental Systems’ 61,000-square-foot lease at 807 Bank Street in Brooklyn. “Biggest thanks to Turnbridge and Dune for their incredible collaboration in bringing this innovative, eco-friendly solution to life,” said Rico Murtha, a managing director at Cushman & Wakefield. “With its forward-thinking design and low carbon footprint, this breakthrough embodies the future of sustainable technology in industrial facilities. We are thrilled for Otto to commence its war on rats in the streets of NYC!” Residential/Multifamily Transaction of the Year, intended to recognize the breakthrough deal or transaction advancing the residential and/or multifamily markets, was awarded to Blackstone and Wells Fargo. The award represented the latter’s role as buy-side M&A adviser and lead financing provider for Blackstone for the $10 billion acquisition of AIR Communities, which included a $2.65 billion term loan and $4 billion in SASB CMBS transactions. Life Sciences Transaction of the Year was awarded to Breakthrough Properties for its 15-year, 230,000-square-foot lease with Pfizer Oncology at the premier life sciences campus Torrey View in San Diego. “In this transaction,” said NYU’s Norman, “Pfizer drives its commitment to accelerating breakthroughs for cancer patients utilizing two state-of-the-art facilities at these buildings.” Then, a special award for Structured Debt Transaction of the Year was presented to Blackstone. “In March of this year, Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies acquired a $1 billion performing senior mortgage loan portfolio from German lender Deutsche PBB,” said Norman. “The portfolio consists of 11 loans secured against performing multifamily, office and hospitality assets across the U.K. and U.S. Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies acquired the entire portfolio on an all-cash basis. So we want to congratulate the team at Blackstone for the 2024 Structured Debt Transaction of the Year Breakthrough Award.” Shifting the focus to specific projects, the Sustainability Project of the Year was awarded to Bank of America for its financing of a $35 million construction loan for The Helios Project, a transformative, solar-powered, 186-unit affordable housing development in Virginia’s Henrico County. “Bank of America was thrilled to work with the Spy Rock Real Estate Group and Crescent Development team on an innovative project that will help revitalize Richmond by delivering much-needed high-quality housing,” said Sam Buzzelli, vice president of community development banking for Bank of America. “The Helios will feature an on-site solar array that generates solar power to operate the property while eliminating tenants’ electricity costs. This was our first project with the development team, but we’re glad to already be working together again.” The award for Adaptive Reuse Project of the Year, awarded for “the repurposing of a building that’s designed to, or has resulted in, a positive impact for the greater real estate community,” according to Norman, went to GFP Real Estate and TPG Real Estate for acquiring and transforming 222 Broadway from a 750,000-square-foot office tower into an 800-unit residential building. Norman referred to the winning project as “an amazing example of adaptive reuse.” “We are deeply honored to receive Commercial Observer’s 2024 Breakthrough Award for Adaptive Reuse Project of the Year alongside our partner, TPG, for our work on 222 Broadway,” said Brian Steinwurtzel, co-CEO and principal of GFP Real Estate. “This recognition is a testament to our shared vision and dedication to reimagining and revitalizing urban spaces. Thank you to Commercial Observer for this prestigious recognition, and congratulations to all the other winners who are shaping the future of our industry.” Design and Development Project of the Year was awarded to Pacific Retail Capital Partners for developing District Galleria, a $2.5 billion transformation of a regional shopping mall into a dynamic mixed-use, transit-oriented district in White Plains, New York. The Public-Private Partnership of the Year award then went to RXR and the City of New Rochelle for the opening of the luxury residential tower Two Clinton Park in New Rochelle, N.Y. “Thanks to Commercial Observer for recognizing this public-private partnership,” said Joseph Graziose, executive vice president of RXR, where he is head of construction and development. “It’s being awarded in 2024, but it’s 10 years in the making, a true testament to what the private and public sectors can do when they put their heads together.” Next up, Tech Advance of the Year was awarded to Savills for the development of the generative AI tool Savills GPT, which was developed in collaboration with OpenAI. “Thank you so much for the recognition for this, especially amongst such wonderful and amazing technology partners,” said Sarah Dreyer, executive vice president and chief information officer at Savills. “We’re really taking a collaborative and innovative approach to what we’re doing with our AI with our technology partners, and we’re excited to share more about it.” The next three awards rewarded firms advancing key asset classes through innovative approaches to design, development, financing and marketing. The award for Innovation in Residential went to Avdoo & Partners Development for the development of Bergen, a residential building designed by Taller Frida Escobedo and featuring 105 residences along with 14,513 square feet of indoor and 11,943 square feet of outdoor amenities. “We’re really excited to be part of such a strong group of peers that were nominated for this award today,” said Krystyn Gatto, Avdoo’s COO. “As you all know, it takes a great deal of effort from a really strong team to be able to make these projects come to life. It was a really unique opportunity to have 400 feet of linear frontage in Brooklyn, which is not very common, and create an urban oasis. Thank you so much for the award.” The Innovation in Industrial Award went to Alterra IOS, the investment platform for Alterra Property Group, for the redevelopment of 6110 Passyunk Avenue in Southwest Philadelphia from a 5-acre industrial outdoor storage site into a state-of-the-art soil remediation facility. The Innovation in Office Award then went to RXR for its RXO tenant experience program. “The RXO program is about elevating the tenant experience,” said Dave Gise, senior vice president and head of hospitality and amenities at RXR. “I wish my entire team was here today with me, but they’re actually elevating the tenant experience on site. So thank you. This means a lot.” The team awards kicked off with Gensler winning as the Top Architecture Team of the Year for its work on projects including Disney’s new headquarters, Google’s St. John’s Terminal, and IBM’s flagship office in New York. “It’s really our pleasure and honor to be a part of such an amazing world-class real estate community, and to help rebuild the fabric of New York,” said Amanda Carroll, managing director and principal at Gensler. “We’re really proud of our physical impact on the city of New York.” Top CRE Financier of the Year (Banks) was awarded to J.P. Morgan Chase based on more than $120 billion in multifamily loans, over $22 billion committed to affordable housing, and $173 billion in total commercial real estate loans in 2024. “We’ve carved out a unique niche as a development lender — a transitional lender — in an area which a lot of banks are not competing in these days, and we’re trying to fend off a lot of these non-bank lenders who are here today to be recognized as well,” said Jeremy Hellinger, a managing director at J.P. Morgan Chase. “We appreciate the amazing team and amazing clients that made this easy.” As a perfect follow-up to his comment, the award for Top Financier of the Year on the Non-Bank side went to Tyko Capital for projects including the provision of the $357 million construction loan for the Flatiron Building conversion project, a $527 million loan for the St. Regis Residences in Miami, and a $555 million long-term, permanent loan for 830 Brickell, Miami’s first new stand-alone office tower in over a decade. “We started in the advisory business as an unknown commodity 14 years back,” said Adi Chugh, Tyko’s founder & CEO. “And I got up one day and said, ‘We’re done with this business. We’re pivoting.’ And everybody said, ‘We are with you.’ Not one employee left. In 15 months, we’ve been able to deploy more than $5 billion.” The final award of the night, Law Firm of the Year, was presented to the Real Estate and Land Use teams at Kramer Levin for handling billions of dollars of transactions for clients such as BlackRock, The Carlyle Group, Mount Sinai Hospital, NYU Langone Medical Center, The Nederlander Organization, Vornado Realty Trust and The Walt Disney Company, among many others. “I want to thank Commercial Observer for the honor, and for bringing greater transparency to our industry,” said Jay Neveloff, partner and chair of the real estate practice at Kramer Levin. “I want to thank my team, which I am incredibly proud to be part of. And I want to thank the other law firms that were recognized. It’s terrific when you have law firms you can collaborate with to get things done efficiently and in the right way.” In the face of a tumultuous and uncertain period for commercial real estate, the Commercial Observer Breakthrough Awards shined a positive light on the state of the industry, and left attendees with a sense of hope and promise for the future. “The general spirit of the room and the fact that it was a sold-out event,” said Freiman, “all indicate that there is a strong confidence in the market as we head into a new year.” Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

[+] chip visible in the background, in this photo illustration taken in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) When I wrote about XAI’s Colossus project a few weeks ago, the scale of the initiative seemed, for lack of a better word, dizzying. You can look back at the video with Patrick from ServetheHome leading the audience through the halls of a supercomputing cluster ostensibly created to power XAI’s Grok chatbot: you can see row after row, rack after rack, of processors set in powerful motion, like a massive army, marching in lock-step and served with enormous amounts of electricity and water. According to recent news, a major vendor of AI hardware is now claiming that three of its major customers are planning projects on the colossal scale of Colossus. Broadcom reports that no fewer than three of its clients may develop data centers with 1,000,000 processors by 2027. This came from the company Q4 earnings call Dec 12, where leaders cited a 220% spike in revenue for the year. "As you know, we currently have three hyperscale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years," President and CEO of Broadcom Hock Tan reportedly said on the call. "In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1,000,000 XPU clusters across a single fabric." For reference, Colossus started by reporting a need of 100,000 GPUs. After quickly doubling that order, Musk then came out with the frank update: that the center would require a cool million of the Nvidia GPUs that run there. Industry leaders like Jensen Huang marveled over the breakneck pace of the data center’s construction: so did notable journalists. It seemed like a unicorn. But is this kind of project, within the next few years, going to become de rigueur? The available reporting clarifies that there are no specific identifications of who is planning these enormous designs. Ask ChatGPT, and it will confirm this, although the model does give a list of top companies that it believes are more capable of scaling up these kinds of plans, including: · Nvidia · Microsoft · Amazon Web Services · Google · OpenAI · Meta · Tesla In addition, ChatGPT cites a collection of Chinese companies that have their own large data center capabilities, including Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu. When you dig a little deeper, it looks like most of these companies are pretty far from this metric. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg has publicly said that the company is aiming for about 350,000 data center GPUs by the end of this year. Google has estimated a total of 2 million GPUs in all of its global operations, not just one center. As for major clusters at AWS, where the hardware provides B2B services, one of the official numbers is that AWS has built a virtual supercomputer performing 9.95 petaflops, which looks like it would require a couple of hundred Nvidia H100s. So a million GPUs is still a really big deal. While the news is impressive, some are likely to be less than enthused about the idea of multiple data centers of this size. If we go back to Colossus, we have critics on the record talking about what they fear in terms of resource competition by this power-hungry behemoth. For one thing, Colossus is estimated to need up to 1,000,000 gallons of water per day - where you often see per capita municipal usage of around 100 gallons per day. There’s also the use of natural gas turbines to provide all of that energy… Experts have been suggesting for a while now that the U.S. is poised to expand nuclear power infrastructure, in order to power data centers, and specifically, to locate the power sources right next to the superclusters in order to make things more efficient. But even if they’re 100% efficient, it’s obvious that the power needs are going to be immense. As key journalists and others covering this issue have been pointing out, things are moving at an incredibly rapid pace. We’re going to have to figure out what impact these supercomputers are making on our society, because even though Colossus is the only one publicly identified as in the works, others are likely to be here soon.

Title: Friedrich Merz: German conservative gunning to become chancellor

Manage your account German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, who hopes to become the next chancellor, is a millionaire ex-corporate lawyer who promises a return to his CDU party's conservative roots as an alternative to the far right. Now that centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a confidence vote following the dramatic collapse of his three-party coalition, Merz may soon get his chance after decades of waiting in the wings. Although he has never held government office, polls say Merz is the favourite to win the February 23 election. Merz, a 69-year-old Roman Catholic, hails from the rural Sauerland region of North Rhine-Westphalia and is the top candidate of the Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian allies the CSU. A long-time rival of the CDU's centrist ex-chancellor Angela Merkel, Merz has criticised her legacy, from her open-door policy to migrants to her insistence on maintaining dialogue with Russia. Merz is a pro-business economic liberal, who published a book in 2008 titled "Dare More Capitalism", a passionate advocate of transatlantic ties and the European Union, and a defender of traditional social values. First elected to the Bundestag three decades ago, Merz took over the CDU leadership on his third attempt after its 2021 election defeat and was confirmed as its chancellor candidate in September. Firmly on the right of the CDU, Merz has backed a tougher immigration policy and law and order stance and pledged to reverse marijuana legalisation and Germany's phase-out of nuclear power, as he seeks to win back voters who have drifted to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). - Seeing red - Merz has sparked anger by labelling the sons of Muslim immigrants "little pashas" and accusing some Ukrainian war refugees of "social welfare tourism", before later apologising. In recent months he has led the charge in raining down withering criticism on Scholz's government, blaming its "wrongheaded" policies and "green-tinted interventionism" for the woes of Germany's stuttering economy. He is rhetorically skilled and visibly enjoys a good political scrap. The news magazine Der Spiegel said he also tends to take conflicts personally and is given to fits of anger, writing that "if Merz were a bullfighter, he would probably hold the red cloth in front of his stomach". Scholz too has tried to portray his rival as a "hothead" who would play "Russian roulette" with Moscow, by sending long-range missiles to Ukraine. Nonetheless, according to news weekly Die Zeit, the old-school conservative is "currently the CDU's answer" to the recent electoral successes of the AfD, which is polling at close to 20 percent. - Hobby pilot - Merz was born on November 11, 1955 and has been married for more than 40 years to Charlotte Merz, a judge. They have three adult children. Merz, who at 198 cm (6ft 6 in) stands out in a crowd, is a licensed pilot who sometimes flies his own private jet. Trained as a lawyer, he was elected to the European Parliament in 1989 and then to the Bundestag, where his mentor was the CDU's powerful late finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. But Merz lost out in a power struggle against Merkel, who took over the CDU leadership in 2002 as the party struggled to rebuild after Helmut Kohl's chancellorship ended in a slush fund scandal. Merkel went on to become Germany's second-longest serving post-war chancellor while Merz -- humiliated, and his influence greatly diminished -- opted for a hiatus from politics. He left parliament in 2009 and for over a decade pursued a successful career in the private sector. He worked as a corporate lawyer, built up a personal fortune and held senior positions on the boards of US investment firm BlackRock and multiple other companies. His business world success and wealth have left him open to charges of being out of touch with most German voters -- a claim he has rejected by insisting he belongs to the "upper middle class". ilp-sr-jsk/fz/giv Our poll, the first post-election poll specifically focused on trust in government, reveals that while voters are less trusting of the government as a result of the election, they believe the government will be more effective and can get things done. There was “a lot of lying from the president-elect” but one comment stood out, said Daniel Dale. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas offered a possible explanation for the recent uptick of drone encounters along the Eastern Seaboard—particularly in the skies above New Jersey—which have prompted concern among residents and lawmakers. Reports of drone sightings across New Jersey and neighboring states, he said Sunday, may be the result of a rule change by the Federal Aviation Administration. “In September of 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration, the FAA, changed the rules so t How is it possible that Americans are good with this corrupt cavalcade of unqualified extremists Trump is nominating?

Instead, death and destruction in Ukraine has actually intensified since Donald Trump won the election last month. Surplus border wall materials are being auctioned, sparking debate over border security and federal resource management. Syrian leader Bashar Assad issued what appeared to be his first public statement since he was ousted and fled with his family to Russia more than a week ago. Steve Bannon is pushing Donald Trump to consider a third presidential term in 2028. The controversial political strategist suggested the two-term limit on U.S. presidents doesn’t count in Trump’s case because his terms in office were not consecutive. “I don’t know, maybe we do it again in ’28,” Bannon told the New York Young Republican Club Sunday. “Are you guys up for that,” he added to a loud burst of applause. “Trump ’28, come on, man!” When Bernard Jones Jr. and his wife, Doris, built their dream home, they didn’t hold back. With water, electricity, clean air and food, they felt ready for any disaster, even a nuclear blast, at their bucolic home in California’s Inland Empire. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. Campaign aide Alex Bruesewitz fired off a needless dig on X after he fainted onstage at a young GOP event. Donald Trump is reportedly eyeing a Democrat as his top contender to lead FEMA. Federal authorities including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security say these sightings are mostly not drones at all. Ukraine said on Monday that North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian troops suffered heavy losses during fighting at the weekend in the Russian region of Kursk. Trump is calling on President Biden to "stop selling the wall," but the White House said it is following the law for unused wall pieces. “Putin understands that, in the world of tomorrow, Russia will be a territorial giant and population dwarf.” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene continues to speculate wildly about the drones. House Republicans are fuming at Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) handling of an end-of-year measure to extend government funding until March, saying it is more like a sprawling omnibus — which they abhor — than a simple temporary funding measure.

It's part of a "striking pattern," said Ayman Mohyeldin. A GOP congresswoman announced Monday that she will refuse to sit on committees or participate in the Republican caucus next year to avoid the “circuses” of her own party. While she waits on GOP leadership to prove it is capable of “governing,“ Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-IN) said she will instead focus on helping Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s efforts to take a chainsaw to federal government spending. “I will stay as a registered Republican but will not sit on committees or participate in the caucu President-elect Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he may reverse President Joe Biden's recent decision to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory. Trump called the decision made by Biden last month “stupid." With the loosening of the restrictions, Biden gave Ukraine long-sought permission to use the Army Tactical Missile System provided by the U.S. to strike Russian positions hundreds miles from its border. Twelve Western countries have agreed measures to "disrupt and deter" Russia's so-called shadow fleet of vessels in order to prevent sanctions breaches and increase the cost to Moscow of the war in Ukraine, Estonia's government said on Monday. The measures were agreed by Germany, Britain, Poland, the Netherlands, the five Nordic nations and the three Baltic states, said Estonia, where leaders of the 10-nation Joint Expeditionary Force were due to meet on Tuesday. WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday he had a "very good talk" with Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, about the war in Gaza and reiterated his threat that "all hell is going to break out" if Hamas does not release its hostages by Jan. 20, the day Trump takes office. "As you know, I gave a warning that if these hostages aren't back home by that date, all hell is going to break out," he said during a press conference in Palm Beach, Florida. “These people are so full of it,” said the former chair of the Republican National Committee, who also called it “just crap.” Donald Trump's niece also pinpointed the "most depressing thing" about her relative's imminent return to power.

President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly considering Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz as his top choice to lead the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in his upcoming administration. Citing two sources with knowledge of the matter, CNN reports that Moskowitz, a Democrat, is a favorite for the role, and adds that a person close to Trump’s transition team confirmed that Moskowitz was in the mix.

Now, she's back in Honduras within reach of the same gang, stuck in a cycle of violence and economic precarity that haunts deportees like her.

The New York judge in President-elect Donald Trump's criminal hush money case ruled Monday that the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision does not apply to that case. Trump had sought to dismiss his criminal indictment and vacate the jury verdict on the grounds that prosecutors, during the trial last May, introduced evidence relating to Trump's official acts as president, after the Supreme Court later ruled in July that Trump is entitled to presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken while in office. Rep. Blake Moore spoke with Fox News Digital about the Congressional DOGE Caucus and its goals after joining Reps. Aaron Bean and Pete Sessions as a co-chair. President-elect Donald Trump’s recent “Meet the Press” interview has triggered concerns among allies and critics about his level of awareness of the details of the sprawling investigation into the Capitol attack that has produced hundreds of convictions in the nearly four years since Jan. 6. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's tech backgrounds could equip them with the skills to slash fraud in government programs, but they'll need to invest.

Title: House Committee Says It Finds Evidence of ‘Climate Cartel’

The House Judiciary Committee said it’s found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. An interim report published by the Republican-led committee said “a cartel” of financial firms and climate activists sought to replace Exxon Mobil Corp. board members in 2021 after the company declined to make a series of climate pledges. “Unfortunately, the pressure campaign against Exxon Mobil isn’t an isolated incident,” the committee wrote. “Through coordinated shareholder pressure campaigns at US companies, the climate cartel seeks to use the trillions of dollars it manages to impose its agenda on the US economy and drain it of affordable energy.” Far from igniting strategic turmoil, the actions against Exxon led by a firm called Engine No. 1 coincided with a massive upturn in the company’s fortunes. The oil giant made record profits in 2022 and its stock outperformed rivals as crude prices bounced back from the pandemic. Exxon now has plans to produce more oil and gas by 2030 than at any time since the 1970s, and also spend $30 billion on low-carbon ventures like carbon capture, hydrogen and lithium. The judiciary committee, chaired by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, singled out groups including Climate Action 100+ and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero for leading what they described as a climate crusade. The committee said its investigation is ongoing. The claims by the House Judiciary Committee are “completely false,” said a spokesperson for CA100+, adding that the group “doesn’t control how shareholders vote, nor has it ever done so.” Last month, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investments. BlackRock and State Street both pushed back against the allegations. State Street, for example, said the suit is “baseless and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process.” Vanguard declined to comment when contacted after the suit was filed on Nov. 27. The committee’s report is the latest salvo against environmental, social and governance investing. And the expectation is that President-elect Donald Trump will add his support to the GOP’s attacks against ESG.

Bitcoin has been on a tear in 2024, surging 145% year-to-date and breaching the psychological $106,000 in recent days. The volatile cryptocurrency has been a polarizing asset, but with an incoming Trump administration, combined with the launch of bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, it seems more and more investors are starting to embrace bitcoin. But not everyone is bullish, and there are some on Wall Street who still see a coming correction in 2025. Here are the biggest bear and bull cases for the token next year. Chief global strategist Peter Berezin of BCA Research expects bitcoin to crash in 2025. Berezin, who is bearish on risk assets broadly for next year on the expectation that a recession will hit, said that bitcoin will finish 2025 at around $45,000, marking a decline of 57% from current levels. With his bearish outlook, Berezin said gold would finally outperform bitcoin in 2025, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid a period of economic weakness. To that point, he argues that bitcoin is not a store of value like gold, but is instead simply a high-beta play on technology stocks. The strategist provided the chart below, which shows the strong correlation between the price of bitcoin and the ProShares UltraPro QQQ 3x Shares ETF. The three-times levered ETF seeks to track daily movements in the Nasdaq 100 Index. Since 2018, the price of bitcoin has closely tracked the fund, with both assets trading about 650% higher in that time. Thus, a crash in tech stocks brought on by a bear market in 2025 would also spark a steep drop in the price of bitcoin. Way on the other end of the spectrum of bitcoin forecasts is Fundstrat's Tom Lee, who is highly bullish on the coin for next year. The strategist said the cryptocurrency is on track to soar 140% in 2025 to $250,000. However, the crypto could soar even higher if the Trump administration establishes a national bitcoin reserve. According to Lee, there are two tailwinds for bitcoin heading into the new year. The first is the halving price cycle for the cryptocurrency, which tends to be bullish for the price of bitcoin in the year following a halving event. The last bitcoin halving occurred on April 20 with another scheduled every four years. A halving reduces the amount of bitcoin that miners are rewarded for solving cryptographic problems by half, limiting the supply of new crypto coming to market. With new supply slashed, the price should rise if demand stays constant or increases. The second factor that is bullish for bitcoin in 2025 is "friendlier government regulations," Lee said in his outlook note last week. President-elect Donald Trump is viewed as a close ally to the crypto space, and his recent administration picks, like Paul Atkins for SEC Chairman, have been cheered by the market. And there could be even more upside for bitcoin in 2025 if a US strategic reserve is announced and implemented. "Our Head of Digital Assets Strategy, Sean Farrell, believes that a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve adds upside to Bitcoin as much as $500,000 in 2025," Lee said in a Monday note. That target represents a 381% increase from current levels. Finally, Lee highlighted that a recent white paper from BlackRock recommends a 2% portfolio allocation to bitcoin for investors. The recommendation could spark further institutional adoption of bitcoin and fuel demand for the crypto, helping push the price higher.

Title: Germany is heading for federal elections – here’s what you need to know
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/16/europe/germany-scholz-election-government-collapse-intl/index.html
Time Published: 2024-12-16T15:52:34Z

Follow: Germany, Europe’s largest economy and normally a pillar of stability, is facing snap elections next year after Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of confidence. His government collapsed in November in a budget dispute but his coalition had been unsteady for months. Scholz lost the vote, which he called himself as a step toward securing an early national election, with 394 ballots against him, 207 in his favor and 116 abstentions. With the election date set for February 23 next year, here’s what’s at stake. There will be seven major parties for which Germans will vote. Four of the seven have made official announcements about their Kanzlerkandidaten – candidates for chancellor. The ever-present two dominant parties of German politics, the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), unofficially known as the Union, make up one grouping. The Social Democrats, or SPD, form another. Given the German system of proportional representation, the government tends to be formed in a coalition, usually headed by the CDU/CSU or the SPD. The winner looks for a partner to form a majority. Since 2021, Scholz’s SPD had governed in an uneasy coalition with the liberal Free Democrats Party (FDP) and the Green Party. In the 16 years before Scholz’s three-party coalition, the CDU, under Angela Merkel, had relied on both the SPD and the FDP as partners in different governments. Related video ‘Complete chaos’: CNN reporter breaks down Germany’s political crisis The CDU/CSU this time around will be led by Friedrich Merz, and the SPD by the incumbent but deeply unpopular chancellor, Scholz. The far-right Alternative for Deutschland party (AfD) has seen strong performances in regional elections give it a national boost. The party’s co-leader, Alice Weidel, is its Kanzlerkandidat. She is known for slick talking and populist policies, particularly on migration. She’s an ardent supporter of upholding traditional German values, famously saying “no one touch my schnitzel!” – a reference to the popular dish. The Green Party should also be considered one to watch. It is unlikely to gather enough votes to be the biggest party, but nonetheless could play an important role in the formation of the next government. The Greens will be led by Robert Habeck, currently the nation’s Economics Minister. The three other major parties will be the Free Democrats; the BSW, a left-wing socialist group named after its leader, Sahra Wagenknecht; and lastly Die Linke, a left-wing political party. All three have yet to officially announce their candidates. Barring a major and unexpected reversal in the polls, Merz of the CDU/CSU is highly likely to be Germany’s new chancellor. National opinion polls currently have the CDU/CSU way out ahead of the others, with 32% of support from those surveyed. The AfD are currently polling in second place with 18%, the SPD in third with 16%, and the Greens with 14%. Merz is not a newcomer to German politics, but this is his second iteration as a politician. Between 1989 and 1994, Merz was a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Germany. He subsequently became a member of the Bundestag, or German parliament, representing the CDU there until 2009. He then left politics to work as a corporate lawyer, where he sat on many supervisory boards, including at investment giant BlackRock. Merz represents the constituency of Hochsauerlandkreis in the Bundestag, the region in which he was born, and currently lives in his hometown of Brilon. He is also widely reputed to be a millionaire and has a private pilot’s license. Merz made two failed attempts to become CDU head in 2018 and 2020. In 2021 he returned as a member of the Bundestag, for the first time in 12 years, and subsequently went on to secure the nomination as head of the CDU, officially taking over in September 2022. Related article Zelensky accuses German chancellor of opening ‘Pandora’s box’ with Putin He is known for having shifted the CDU to the right, with a tougher stance on migration, and a strong economic mind. During his bid to become party leader, he campaigned on not being a Merkel-style heir, unlike his challengers, thus marking the end of the centrist policies of the CDU during her era as chancellor. Leonie von Randow, a political reporter at German broadcaster WELT TV who will be covering the election campaign, told CNN that Merz “knows a thing or two about the economy, and that is obviously something that many people care about. Many people hope (he) can move things forward.” Merz is a very strong proponent of backing Ukraine as it fights Russia’s full-scale invasion. He has been a vocal supporter of giving Ukraine German-made Taurus missiles, weapons that could be used to attack Russian targets far beyond Ukraine’s front lines. Scholz, by contrast, has consistently refused to supply them to Kyiv. Merz made a surprise trip to the Ukrainian capital earlier this month, where he urged European nations to form a “common vision” for peace in Ukraine, especially given the impending arrival of US President-elect Donald Trump in the White House. The economy is going to play a central role in the election, particularly given its sluggish performance under Scholz. In recent days the German Central Bank has revised down predicted growth forecasts by 0.2%, stating that “the German economy is set to stagnate in the winter half-year 2024-25 and only begins to make a slow recovery over the course of 2025.” Connected to the debate on the economy will be a focus on reviving the country’s important automotive industry. The Central Bank has said that problems within the industry are “structural,” and are thus exacerbating the drag on the economy. Major companies including Volkswagen, one of world’s largest car manufacturers, are facing major layoffs and plant closures. Arguments over immigration will also be critical in this election, particularly as parties look to lure votes away from a surging AfD, which has made it a core issue. “The election is probably coming at a very good time for the AfD… this is a moment when many people are generally very unhappy with the government, so they kind of want to make a point and vote for an extreme party to show how unhappy they are,” von Randow told CNN. Scholz reintroduced checks on borders with neighboring European nations in recent months, a move many saw as him trying to curry favor with voters who may be turning towards the populist AfD. The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria will also play into the national debate. Germany took in more Syrian migrants than any other European nation during its civil war. Campaigning around how each party would handle immigrants has already started. It is very hard to see an outcome where the CDU/CSU and Friedrich Merz do not emerge victorious. Their lead appears cemented and unassailable, but the major question surrounds the formation of a stable government. The CDU/CSU are unlikely to win an outright majority of the 630 seats up for grabs. That means they will have to form a coalition with one (or more) of the other parties. The question is who? Should the AfD perform as the opinion polls suggest, it would mark a major sea change in German politics. Since its formation in 2013, the party has never gained more than 94 seats. It finished as the fifth biggest party in 2021 and third largest in 2017. While the AfD will see themselves as potential kingmakers, the CDU/CSU may be unwilling to give them such a prominent voice in running the country. That leaves the SPD, with whom they have worked previously, particularly in the Merkel era. Or, they could look further left towards the Greens, but that also may come with a clash of principles and policies, given their more left-leaning nature. Either way, the federal election looks likely to leave the SPD and Scholz deeply humbled, and entering into a period of self-reflection. “It is probably the end of his political career,” von Randow told CNN.

Title: Here’s Why US Manufacturers Can’t Quit China

Graphic of Made in America Sign with Freight Ship from China US manufacturers face increasing pressure to divest from China due to threats of mounting tariffs and geopolitical instability, but the reality is, most can’t decouple. Trade wars notwithstanding, the US simply can’t quit China. But, that’s not for lack of effort. There has been a trend over the last six-plus years toward shifting manufacturing activities away from China. According to a 2023 report published by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Harnessing the Tectonic Shifts in Global Manufacturing, US goods imports from China declined by 10% from 2018 through 2022 in inflation-adjusted terms, they rose by 18% from Mexico, 44% from India, and 65% from the ten countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.* Graphic from 2023 Report from BCG - Harnessing the Tectonic Shifts in Global Manufacturing - Change ... [+] in US goods imports, 2018 - 2022 Wage inflation, or rising labor costs was the initial driver for companies to turn away from China. According to the ​​US China-Business Council, China has not been considered a low labor cost production base in over ten years. Thus, labor-intensive and cost-sensitive industries like textiles have been moving out of China, to countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh, since the mid-2010s. But over the last six years, a cascade of other factors have bubbled to the surface, signaling to US companies, the China party is over and it is time to “break up”. First, in 2018, geopolitical factors intensified, with President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on almost all Chinese exports. Then, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed underlying weaknesses in the global supply chain as factories shut down and ports were closed, logistics networks that were essential for critical goods such as medical supplies, semiconductors and consumer goods were disrupted and freight costs surged due to high demand (The cost to ship a container from China to the west coast of the US increased ten-fold from around $2,000 to over $20,000 in the first nine months of 2021). Next, in 2022, the Russia / Ukraine conflict led to an increase in the price of commodities like oil, gas and grain, which China imports from Russia, leading to volatility in its domestic production costs. What’s more, escalating security breaches, including China sending spy balloons into US territory in 2023 and hacking major telecommunication providers in 2024, made already strained geopolitical tensions worse. According to a House Committee report on Homeland Security released in October 2024, the FBI opens new cases to counter the Chinese Communist Party's espionage and intelligence operations roughly every 12 hours. And finally, China’s ongoing military drills threatening to annex Taiwan have a direct impact on: (1) US national security interests, because the US sees Taiwan as part of an “island chain” of allies (along with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines); and (2) US economic interests, since Taiwan is a major manufacturer of semiconductor microchips and IT hardware equipment for US companies like Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple. Needless to say, many companies have been “de-risking” their supply chain by diversifying into more stable regions in Asia, and near-shoring to Mexico and Central America. The automotive industry, particularly electric vehicle production, has seen substantial reshoring activity. The semiconductor industry has also significant reshoring activity, spurred by national security concerns and government initiatives such as the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS Act). I spoke with Scott Ellyson, Chief Executive Officer of East West Manufacturing (East West), a global engineering and manufacturing services company based in Atlanta, Georgia, to gain an “inside look” at how his company’s supply chain has shifted in recent years. Scott Ellyson, Chief Executive Officer East West was initially founded in 2001, with the goal of leveraging manufacturing arbitrage globally to help clients reduce overall cost and increase competitiveness - and that meant initially setting up shop in China - in the Shenzhen region. The company, which produces thousands of products for Fortune 100 and 500 companies, including medical equipment like defibrillators and ventilators, electric motors, robotics, exercise equipment and HVAC / cooling devices, has since expanded operations to nine sites in seven countries. Ellyson explained that the decision to establish manufacturing operations in a particular region is complex, and depends on several key factors. And, low cost labor is not actually the most important consideration (which makes sense since China has not been a low labor cost production region for several years). More critical factors include: access to raw materials and a network of suppliers, skilled labor, distribution and logistics infrastructure and tax incentives. For example, East West was able to shift certain production capacity from China to Vietnam in 2002, because rubber was readily available in Vietnam and it wasn’t a very complicated supply chain. And, the company has been able to deepen its operations after identifying additional resources uniquely available in Vietnam. “Raw materials are typically the main driver in my experience,” Ellyson explained. Ellyson elaborated that they have also acquired a facility in Costa Rica, for medical manufacturing, in part because Costa Rica has a free trade agreement with both China and the US, so raw materials and components can be imported, and finished products can be exported, without tariffs. However, the logistical costs there are very high, so “we focus on small products with value density” in that region where you can “air freight in, air freight out, without major expense.” East West also has two facilities in Juarez, Mexico. Ellyson shared that for products that have a high amount of mechanical components like plastics and metal, it is a pretty “immature supply-chain” and the costs are 15-20% higher than Asia. But, some of this is offset by better lead-time from final assembly to delivery (one week vs. one month or more); lower freight costs ($2-4K to drive a truck over the border vs. $6-7K to ship a container from Asia); and low tariffs due to the free trade agreement through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or the USMCA. And so with such a clear rationale and demonstrable efforts to decouple from China, why can’t we just “break up” already? Understanding why China has a chokehold on the US and many multinational companies has a lot to do with the government’s creation of special economic zones (SEZs) in the 1980s that were designed to attract foreign investment, spur innovation and accelerate industrial growth. The first SEZs were considered experiments because previously China was a “closed” economy, where the government controlled almost all aspects of production, prices, and resource allocation, effectively isolating itself from the global market and limiting private enterprise and foreign trade. Sunset in Shenzhen, China For example, the city of Shenzhen was once a small fishing village of 30,000 before it was designated as one of the first SEZ in 1980. Now, Shenzhen, which was ranked as a top ten global finance center in 2024, is home to multinational tech companies like Huawei and Tencent (maker of Wechat) and in 2023 was listed by Forbes as one of the top 10 cities with the most billionaires, is considered by some to be “China’s Silicon Valley”. The Shenzhen experiment illustrates what happens when you bring together dense clusters of suppliers, logistical infrastructure (including highways, railroads, and ports), skilled workers, economic investment and tax incentives. In fact, it has been estimated by the World Economic Forum that 90% of the world's electronics are made in Shenzhen, including mobile phones, televisions, air conditioning units, and drones. The other major piece that gives China its competitive edge is the access to critical raw materials (CRMs) such as cobalt, titanium, lithium, magnesium, and rare earth elements, either by mining them directly or importing them from other countries and refining them. In 2022, the US Geological Survey published a list of 50 mineral commodities critical to the US economy (and national security) and China is the primary source of 26 of the 50 minerals. These CRMs are used in a variety of sectors, including energy production, communication technology, transportation, and national defense and are essential for everything from mobile phones and computer hard drives, to batteries for electric vehicles, as well as precision-guided missiles and high-tech ammunition. Leading Import Sources (2019–22) of Non-fuel Mineral Commodities where US was Greater Than 50% Net ... [+] Import Reliant As a consequence, US companies are heavily reliant on Chinese companies to source component parts, and manufacture products more cost effectively. Boeing has stated China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model — the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 Dreamliner; and that more than 10,000 Boeing airplanes currently fly throughout the world with parts and assemblies built in China. Apple has been relocating factories into Southeast Asia and India, but still relies on several Chinese-made components in its products, such as acoustics, glass, connectors, and display panels. Apple also assembles the majority of iPhones, iPads and MacBooks and other accessories in China (in Shenzhen, Chengdu, and Zhengzhou), through its contract manufacturing partner, Foxconn. And, while Tesla manufactures its vehicles for the US market in the US, forty percent of Tesla’s EV battery suppliers are Chinese companies. Ellyson of East West drilled down on the economic realities of the supply chain trickling back to China, elaborating that they had two plant closures in North Carolina in 2024, which were a direct result of the 25% tariffs imposed by President Trump in his first term. He shared, “we were one of the largest electronics assemblers east of the Mississippi and many of the components have to come from Asia…there is no domestic source,” so when faced with already higher labor costs in the US, combined with the rising cost of important component parts due to the tariffs, “we had to move most of those assemblies to Costa Rica and Mexico.” I also spoke with Cres Ferrell, Managing Partner at ReNEW Manufacturing Solutions (ReNEW), which is a "Build-to-Print" machining and fabrication company with five locations, all located in the US. He explained that nearshoring to Mexico, is really just the “China backdoor.” Map of US - Mexico Border ReNEW produces machinery parts for large Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) – mostly using carbon steel, including components for railcars, locomotives, and heavy construction equipment. However, they are constantly negotiating with their OEM customers that want to cut costs by moving to Mexico. Just across the border, Chinese companies have set up shops and are “importing steel at a 70% discount to US steel” and then the OEMs can import product to the US, tariff-free, under the USMCA. As a consequence, ReNEW has to remain competitive by creating operational efficiencies through automation and by extension, reducing spend on US labor. With so much fragmentation of the global supply chain, it begs the question, what can and should be manufactured and assembled right here in the USA, at competitive prices. Ferrell emphasized that there is opportunity in the machining and fabrication industry, explaining that there are actually 200,000 component parts of a locomotive but there is a huge shortage of skilled labor because technical trades like welding, for example, are no longer taught in high school as a vocation. Both Ellyson and Ferrell agree that there are certain products that can be prioritized for US manufacturing, such as complex or new technology that requires a lot of precision, validation and hands-on, high-touch support and expertise. It’s an important step in the right direction that the Biden administration did pass three massive pieces of legislation funneling trillions of dollars and/or tax incentives toward US innovation and industrial productivity, that have ultimately fueled a manufacturing renaissance across the US. Since 2021, over $2.1 trillion has been allocated by the government to pro-manufacturing initiatives through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and the CHIPS Act. And according to Blackrock, as of November 2023, the private sector has pledged an additional $614 billion towards the production of semiconductors, electric vehicles, and batteries. But, it will require much more capital and investment to build up the US manufacturing ecosystem similar to the SEZ model in China, and it may take decades to develop. In the meantime, “Made in China”, whether directly or indirectly, is the sobering reality that we face. * The ten countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Scott Ellyson is the CEO and co-founder of East West Manufacturing (EW), a global engineering and manufacturing services company specializing in the realization of products, from design through distribution. With over 30 years of experience in manufacturing and supply chain management, Scott has been instrumental in driving the company’s growth and innovation. East West serves core industries such as Smart Devices/IoT, Automation/Robotics, Industrial Technology, and Medical/Wellness by providing scalable solutions, rapid speed-to-market, cost efficiency, and uncompromising quality.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily After a string of high-end design collaborations and design exhibits between Paris and Miami, the biotechnology company is ready to present its first furniture pieces covered in Reishi. Senior Correspondent, Home and Interiors MILAN — Just over a year after Mycoworks’ Reishi, a new material grown from mycelium, debuted its first full fashion look at the Buro Stedelijk museum space in Amsterdam, it’s ready to take on the world of interiors. The first furniture pieces covered in Reishi are being made by the French family-run firm Ligne Roset and will hit the market in 2025, the California-based company told WWD. “We are so ready to enter that world. We are already here. For interior design, there are so many possibilities and we’re working with architects on private mansions and hotels as we speak,” said the firm’s senior vice president of sales Frederick Martel. Related Articles Jewelry Swarovski Introduces Its Most Sustainable Crystals Interior Design RH Expands With Three New California Locations and Launches First Waterworks Showroom Mycoworks has been working with Ligne Roset, which was founded in 1860, for the past five years. Martel added that the collaboration has tested Reishi’s performance on an industrial level to understand if it will one day be able to meet market demands. Among those tests was putting 220 pounds in weight on top of a chair cushion made of Reishi and repeating that test 20,000 times. You May Also Like Other collaborations have followed, in Europe and North America, Martel said, declining to mention names. In 2021, Mycoworks rose to the international fore after it covered Hermès’ Victoria shopper bag with its high-end mycelium leather. Over the past year, the biotechnology company founded in 2013 by artists Phil Ross and Sophia Wang has been actively pushing Reishi into the broader design world and is gearing up to see Reishi-covered furniture sold on the wider market. During Design Miami Paris in October, Mycoworks enlisted seven French designers and artists to create seven products including folding screens, desks and lighting fixtures out of Reishi. At the Alcova space during Design Miami, Stockholm’s Studio Tooj introduced the Duk side table made with Reishi using cutting-edge craftsmanship. At the carbon-positive Populus hotel in Denver, 700 sheets of Reishi were used to construct a dramatic tapestry as its main centerpiece. Reishi is made of mycelium, which is the root structure of mushrooms. It is first grown in a sheet before it is harvested and finished into a soft material in Spain. Mycoworks, which is based in Emeryville, Calif., on the eastern edge of San Francisco Bay and to the north of Silicon Valley, is also amping up its industrial capacity. Last year it cut the ribbon on its first commercial-scale Fine Mycelium production plant in South Carolina. Spanning 136,000 square feet, the factory is equipped to employ more than 350 people, which was envisioned to facilitate an influx of orders estimated at “millions of square feet of Reishi per year,” the company said at the time. “This is the moment the luxury industry has been waiting for; a plastic-free, leather-like material that offers undeniable beauty and performance — at scale,” said Patrick Thomas, former chief executive officer of Hermès who now serves as a Mycoworks board member. “Now that the challenge of supply has been solved, brands will move quickly to commercialize items made with Reishi,” he said at the time. Mycoworks’ proprietary Fine Mycelium production process cultivates mycelium in a controlled environment, harnessing its natural growth to create smooth sheets of Reishi, it contends, that meet the luxury industry’s performance standards. One of Reishi’s major selling points is that it is easily made in perfect geometric rectangles and therefore more efficiently cut without waste, versus the 40 to 70 percent estimated for leather production, according to Martel. Since Reishi’s introduction the company has partnered with major brands across the luxury, fashion, home furnishings and automotive industries. In addition to Hermès and Ligne Roset, it has collaborated with General Motors. The latter has been a partner for several years and is emblematic of Mycoworks’ endeavors in the auto industry. Last July, Reishi was used for the interiors of the electric concept car Sollei, unveiled by Cadillac. The company has a diverse roster of investors that includes family-run businesses, venture capital firms, Decarbonization Partners, which is a Blackrock joint venture with Singapore firm Temasek, and VIPs like Natalie Portman. In July 2022, Mycoworks revealed $125 million in Series C financing, with a pool of investors that included Prime Movers Lab, SK Networks, Mirabaud Lifestyle Impact and Innovation Fund, in addition to other new and existing investors with track records in the biotech space. Across the board, alternative material firms have been a target by venture capital businesses and fashion firms alike. In 2019, Chanel acquired a minority stake in green chemistry company Evolved by Nature, as part of its strategy of developing sustainable materials. Formerly known as Silk Inc., the Boston-based firm focuses on designing and developing biomaterials-based products for industries ranging from personal care to textiles and medical devices. Its Activated Silk technology, consisting of natural silk in liquid form, provides a nontoxic alternative to chemicals in products.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Ethena Labs has launched USDtb, a new stablecoin backed by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The stablecoin maintains a peg to the US dollar, holding 90% of its reserves in BUIDL issued by BlackRock. It was developed in partnership with Securitize, a leader in real-world asset tokenization. “In light of the rapidly accelerating demand for different stablecoin options, we saw a clear opportunity to provide a new product that offers users an entirely different risk profile from USDe without them having to leave our trusted ecosystem,” said Ethena founder Guy Young. The new stablecoin operates independently from Ethena’s flagship USDe token and can be used like any other stablecoin, allowing seamless and unrestricted transfers. USDtb will be available on multiple networks including Ethereum mainnet, Base, Solana, and Arbitrum through LayerZero integration. Ethena has been one of the fastest-growing DeFi protocols, attracting nearly $6 billion in user funds since early 2024. The introduction of USDtb is a strategic move by Ethena to further stabilize USDe, particularly during bearish market conditions, according to the company’s press release. USDe is Ethena’s flagship stablecoin, offering a steady $1 peg while providing users with an attractive 27% annualized yield under current conditions. Ethena’s Risk Committee has approved USDtb as a USDe backing asset, enabling the protocol to reallocate reserves to USDtb during periods of negative funding rates. Beyond its operational goals, Ethena’s governance token, ENA, has gained significant attention recently. Over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial purchased $500,000 worth of the token, sparking a 25% rally before ENA’s price eventually stabilized. At press time, ENA is trading at $1.21 with a market cap of $3.5 billion. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA is ending 2024 on a historically strong footing, and 2025 might turn out to be equally auspicious provided that the GPU maker is able to deliver on Wall Street's lofty expectations. Today, Truist Securities raised the proverbial bar on the expectations count by incorporating a whole new product segment within its stock price target computations for NVIDIA. NVIDIA $NVDA price-target raised to $204 (from $169) at Truist Securities, implying +54% upside. Analyst Will Stein expects Nvidia to announce a client-side CPU in 2025, which would unlock an additional $35 billion in TAM: "Incrementally constructive on AI dominance & client… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) December 16, 2024 Truist Securities analyst, Will Stein, dropped a bombshell today by pegging expectations of an entirely new product segment to NVIDIA's 2025 projections: "We believe NVDA will announce a client-side CPU during 2025, opening up an additional ~$35B TAM." The analyst remains "incrementally constructive on [NVIDIA's] AI dominance & client CPU," while noting that the stock has proven to be a "home-run investment over the last two years owing to a new wave of AI demand." Stein expects 2025 to be another "constructive" year for NVIDIA due to the opening up of its CPU-related TAM and continuing market dominance via its full technology stack: "All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack (not just chips...or servers...or even server racks...but especially software and pre-trained models)." Accordingly, the analyst has raised his price target for NVIDIA shares from $169 to $204, implying a ~54 percent upside potential relative to the current price level. Meanwhile, as we recently reported, NVIDIA's next-gen "Blackwell Ultra" GB300 AI servers are expected to debut by mid-2025. Despite suffering initial setbacks from several minor design flaws, NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture is slated for significant expansion in 2025, as per the trend that can be gleaned from the GPU manufacturer's supply chain partners. This dovetails with recent reports that suggest ongoing discussions between NVIDIA and TSMC to manufacture Blackwell GPUs in the latter's Arizona facilities. Bear in mind that the outgoing Biden administration recently awarded TSMC $6.6 billion in new funding to incentivize its production facilities in Arizona, where commercial activities are currently slated to commence in the first half of 2025.

Red Cat shares rallied 27% on news that it's working with Palantir to integrate visual navigation software into its drones. The ticker RCAT has been the sixth-most-popular mention on Reddit's famed WallStreetBets page over the last 24 hours, behind only crypto play MicroStrategy, Nvidia, Tesla, Palantir and SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust), according to data tracking firm Quiver Quantitative. RCAT's popularity on WSB has surged more than 1,625% in the past 24 hours, the firm said. Donald Trump Jr.-affiliated Unusual Machines was another big winner Monday, surging about 16%. Kratos Defense and Security Solutions added about 5%. Aerovironment gained 8%. The partnership news comes as recent sightings across the Northeast have reignited interest in the sector, while also fueling national security concerns. FBI officials on Thursday said there was "no evidence" that the drones jeopardize "national security and public safety." Officials also said Saturday that many of the sightings are "manned aircraft being misidentified as drones." Many on Wall Street view the incoming White House administration as a potential boon that could boost funding for the sector and U.S.-made drones. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has spoken favorably of drone technology and is poised to play an influential role in President-elect Donald Trump's White House. "On the drone protection side, federal government counter-drone technologies are increasingly being used by local and state law enforcement to protect stadiums, airports, prisons, and other public settings," said William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma in a note to clients. "This will likely result in a surge in counter-drone investments by local and state government agencies over the next decade." Investors have also come to view ties to the sector through Trump Jr.'s connection to Unusual Machines as another potential tailwind for the industry. The eldest son of the president-elect joined the advisory board of the company in November. Congress has also taken interest in the sector. The National Defense Bill, recently passed in the House, is also drawing interest. If the bill is passed by the Senate and signed into law, China-based DJI would be barred from selling new drones to the U.S. — CNBC's Yun Li contributed reporting. Got a confidential news tip?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Sam's Club is riding the dual waves of Walmart's (WMT) rise as budget-conscious consumers flock to wholesale retailers. Led by CEO Chris Nicholas, who started in September 2023, the wholesale club founded in 1983 by Walmart founder Sam Walton has been a beneficiary of inflation-weary shoppers. In its most recent fiscal quarter, same-store sales, excluding fuel, jumped 7%, compared to a 3.8% increase in the same time period a year ago. Through the nine months ended Oct. 31, Sam's Club has hauled in $67.2 billion in sales and $1.8 billion in operating profits. Walmart's third largest business segment behind its namesake and international division is on track to post close to $90 billion in sales this year, according to analyst estimates. Parent company Walmart, with its own string of record-breaking quarters, in part powered by Sam's Club, is the 2024 Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award winner. "We are the essence of the Walmart culture," Nicholas said. "We've spent the last year really getting after this really exciting growth agenda." Experts contend that one key aspect that differentiates Sam's Club from rivals like Costco (COST) and BJ's (BJ) is its investment in technology. "Costco is clearly the market share leader in the club space, ... we think Sam's Club is a formidable competitor," CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram told Yahoo Finance, "One area where Sam's Club is better than Costco currently is related to their technology, and that's because it's backed by Walmart, which is very technology savvy, unlike Costco." Sam's Club's Scan and Go technology, now rolled out in most locations, allows members to skip the checkout line. Shoppers scan items' barcodes on the app as they go along, pay in-app, and a member checks a few items to ensure they match the customer's order upon walking out. The Just Go exit arches do that job for the employees, using computer vision to quickly scan items as shoppers exit. Costco posted e-commerce growth of 13.2%, compared to Sam's Club 26% gain in the latest quarter. "You need to be technology savvy to win younger generations," Sundaram said. Nicholas has been in the retail industry for more than two decades. He started pricing goods at a grocery store in Hull, England as a 14-year-old. "The first day I was there, the store manager said to me, 'Listen, Chris, you've got to take this cage of goods and hide it because my regional manager is coming around this afternoon, and he doesn't know I bought all of this inventory,'" Nicholas recalled. "So I tell that story to my managers. I'm like, 'I'm watching you. Please don't do that.'" In 1983, Walton opened the first Sam's Club in Midwest City, Okla. His intention was to help other small businesses access products and services. It was also shortly after its competitor Costco (COST), then known as Price Club, made its debut in the 1970s in San Diego. As of November, there are 600 Sam's Club locations in the US. Costco and BJ's Wholesale operate 625 and 266 stores in the US, respectively. Sam's Club also has 50 locations open in China, under the leadership of Walmart International CEO Kath McLay, with plans to open more in the country, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi. Here, Nicholas shares his thoughts with Yahoo Finance on Sam's Club's growth potential, what's working, and how it's investing in tech to compete. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Yahoo Finance: September marked one year since you became Sam's Club CEO. How would you describe your year? Chris Nicholas: Sam's Club is this little $90 billion business hidden in the corner of Walmart. You get to see the essence of our culture, and you get to do things as a pioneer, as an innovator, that you can only do because you're the little $90 billion company in the corner. [Our] growth agenda is focused on getting digital engagement with our members. ... Probably the thing that stands out most there is the digital engagement in the clubs and e-commerce, ... Scan and Go, and those Just Go arches. The third thing is great items, great value. [Private label] Members Mark would be the pinnacle of that. Sam’s Club had quite the year. Same-store sales in the recent fiscal quarter were up 7%, excluding fuel. What were the main drivers of growth? In the club business, the best health check you can have is how many members you've got and are they renewing. We're really happy that we've got all-time highs in membership and in renewal rates. ... [What] helped us grow even faster is this idea of experiences. ... There's been this idea ... that you can't have great experiences because it costs money. We really disagree with that. We've been investing really hard, whether it's leveraging the Walmart platforms or e-commerce and supply chain to building these new technologies that people are engaging with in unprecedented ways. In e-commerce, specifically, what is driving growth there? I've been in the e-commerce, retail business for more than 20-odd years now. It's not a new thing. Here's the thing, people want you to give them what they want. They want more. They want better items. They want more quality. They want lower prices. And they want you to serve them however they want to be served. Our job is to give them all of that, so if you have the choice, ... you can come into the club and shop, but if we can pick it for you, and you just pick it up, or we can deliver those items from the club to your home, or if you want an extended assortment, we can send them from the fulfillment center, but you still get Sam's Club prices. Sam's Club would be 20% to 25% cheaper than retail. You can get e-commerce delivered to your home, or you can pick it up, without the friction of shopping, at club prices. That's just an incredible value proposition, and we think is unmatchable. Are people still mostly going to Sam's Club for groceries? The tradition of the club model would be: You come with a flatbed or a big car, and you fill everything up, and you do it once a month. That's not the way that people shop us. Now, people are much more prone to come to us for the top-up shop, for the lobster mac and cheese and the bottle of Russian River Pinot or whatever that you want and hopefully pick up some GM [general merchandise] on the way. We think that we are not just a grocer, but we do enjoy that frequency of visit with our amazing fresh business and food businesses. On top of that frequency driver of grocery, ... you get the treasure hunt of general merchandise items, whether that's technology or wares or seasonal items or apparel. ... We want to be a GM business, a services business, and a grocer. Read more: Best credit cards for groceries (December 2024) Sam's Club is a membership model — who is its audience? At the heart of it, the Sam's Club member is [the] better-off-than-average family. ... We see great growth in our business members, we see exceptional growth with small, young families that are just coming through and starting their journey. Whilst we might tether on the wealthier shopper with family, we want to serve everybody. How is Sam's Club competing with rivals? Of course, Costco is such a prevalent player in the space. If you take a look at the whole of the club channel, that's less than 7% of total retail in the US. ... Whilst you can get better always by looking at your competitors and looking at what they're doing better than you, your main focus better be what your members are asking for. Trust is more important in the club model than anywhere, and the reason is because I'm asking you to pay me up front for the promise of value in the future. We spend a lot of time working on "How do you build an ecosystem that just takes all of the decision making away from you?" Because you just know you get the right value from Sam's Club, and then you go tell your friends, and then they come join. How is Sam's Club investing in technology? Think about the back end of your technology and the member-facing [part]. The back end is really difficult to invest in, [it] takes a long time, and it's really great that Walmart has already built a lot of those platforms. What we're doing is leveraging on the back end of the supply chain technology ... automation, the e-commerce technology — that's all of the stuff that they do in the fulfillment centers and the clubs but also the app that members use and our associates use. All of that takes a lot of time and a lot of effort. I'm really grateful that we're part of Walmart, so we get to leverage that. That means the Sam's Club engineers are able to focus on creating disruptive, pioneering, delightful experiences for our members that we wouldn't be able to do if we didn't have that backbone, that back end. [At] CES last January, ... we announced that we were going to roll out these computer vision arches ... if you use Scan and Go, you can walk out [of the store] and there's zero friction. This year, we've used technology that's computer vision ... to take 100 million tasks out of our associates hands in clubs. We don't have fewer associates. They just don't have to do the mundane things they used to do: the paperwork, the clipboards, the how do you find the inventory? How do you solve problems for members? Are you thinking about artificial intelligence in that capacity? AI is everywhere. We've been working on AI for a long time. ... The Scan and Go is a great example of AI. We're using AI to help with search. We use AI to help with recommendations on the app, ... recommendations if you may have forgotten something. ... We're using AI to look at how you transacted with us before. AI is becoming rooted in everything that we're doing, but we're doing it in a way that's human, and I think that's a really important nuance for us. How are you thinking about potential issues ahead — like tariffs — under the new administration? We've got a limited assortment in Sam's Club, so that gives a lot of agility and flexibility, and our exposure to imports is insignificant. How about the reacceleration of inflation? What are you seeing there, and do you expect any change in 2025? My merchandise team [fights] every single day to reduce prices for our members. ... That is what the club model does. This is the moment for the Sam's Club business model. The Sam's model and the club model, in general, shouldn't make any money on what we sell, so the lower you can run your operation in terms of cost, the lower you bring your prices down and you make your profit from membership. It's a really cool model because what it means is that you get better items and sell them cheaper, you get more engagement, and those members then renew with you, and they tell their friends, and they come and join your club. This is why the club model is such a great place right now, and that's not just in the US. ... We see that globally.

Title: MicroStrategy Stock Jumps On Nasdaq 100 Inclusion—Bitcoin Giant Up 570% This Year

Shares of MicroStrategy rallied Monday after the corporate bitcoin holder earned a spot in a key stock index, an apparent institutional vote of confidence in the company whose stock has been red hot amid the cryptocurrency boom. MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor speaks at a 2021 conference. MicroStrategy stock gained 4% at market open, enjoying a bump from the Nasdaq announcing after Friday’s close that the Virginia-based company would join its Nasdaq 100 stock index next Monday. The inclusion on the Nasdaq 100, which is the basis for the popular Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund, should result in about $2.1 billion in net buying of MicroStrategy shares as portfolios adjust to the move, according to Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. Also boosting the share price of MicroStrategy, which trades under the ticker MSTR, was a weekend rally for bitcoin, which hit a fresh all-time high Monday of over $106,000; almost all of MicroStrategy’s underlying value is tied to its bitcoin horde rather than a more traditional revenue-based business model. MicroStrategy stock has gained a robust 573% in 2024, outstripping bitcoin’s 150% gain and the S&P 500’s 29% return. Shares of the other two new Nasdaq 100 entrants, Axon Enterprise and Palantir, had less stark reactions, with Taser stun gun maker Axon stock up 1% and analytics-based defense contractor Palantir trading flat. MicroStrategy describes itself as the “world's first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company.” Part of the dot-com boom at the turn of the millennium, MicroStrategy shifted its focus beginning in 2020 from its software business to becoming the most prominent voice advocating for bitcoin as a long-term store of value akin to gold. The company owns 439,000 bitcoins in its strategic reserve, equivalent to $46 billion, or 2.2% of the world’s total bitcoin supply. Some 40% of MicroStrategy’s bitcoins have been acquired over the last 40 days, according to Chhugani, dating back to the election of Donald Trump, an outspoken bitcoin ally. MicroStrategy has taken the rare step of issuing debt to fund its bitcoin purchases. “If you are not a Bitcoin believer, this is scary, but MSTR’s Bitcoin strategy is a long term high-conviction ‘buy & hold’ strategy with the view to hold Bitcoin till it surpasses Gold and beyond,” Chhugani wrote Monday. MicroStrategy certainly has its critics, including investment firm Citron Research, which announced a short position on MicroStrategy stock last month, calling the stock “overheated” and “completely detached” from bitcoin fundamentals. With a market capitalization of about $100 billion, MicroStrategy trades more than two times higher than its bitcoin holdings, with its other operations hardly offering much further support, as its software business brought in less than $120 million last quarter. 2,700%. That’s how much MicroStrategy stock has returned over the last five years. That easily outranks the roughly 2,200% and 1,600% gains from the S&P’s top performers during that stretch in artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and Elon Musk-led electric vehicle company Tesla, respectively, according to FactSet. MicroStrategy’s outspoken founder and chairman Michael Saylor is worth more than $10 billion, making him the 254th-richest person in the world. His net worth has more than doubled since March.

Title: “Green AI”: The Yin-Yang Of A Breakthrough

Nature and technology abstract concept, robot hand and natural hand covered with grass reaching to ... [+] each other, tech and nature union, cooperation, 3d rendering The boom of Artificial Intelligence has accelerated, revolutionized, and redefined industrial landscapes across the board. Clean tech is expanding in tandem, pushing the limit of innovative technologies. While each sector independently holds enormous – and in many cases untapped – potential, their combined power to accelerate the clean energy transition is especially promising. But as with any widespread technological advancement, growing pains often mark the start of a new era. Originally designed to generate centralized energy, the demands being put on our 20th century grid have expanded. The outdated system must now adapt to a multi-directional flow of electricity as clean energy efforts pull from alternative sources. That is where Green AI comes in. Set to tackle climate change, it promises to redefine energy systems with innovative solutions that prioritize sustainability and efficiency. Solar panels and wind turbines generating renewable energy for green and sustainable future. In 2022, the US Energy Information Administration predicted that by 2050, 44% of power will come from renewables — more than double the 21% achieved in 2023. In the EIA’s 2023 outlook, which takes into account the impact of the IRA, the prediction increased to a majority. To achieve this, a modernization of the grid is inevitable. The United States Department of Energy discussed this in its report, AI for Energy: Opportunities for a Modern Grid and Clean Energy Economy. Optimistic findings suggest that AI can unlock opportunities to accelerate a 100% clean energy future in the US. Real-time data will support the integration of renewables into the grid, while mitigating risks and anomalies that contribute to the $150 billion annual burden of power outages in the US. The United States is not the only country outgrowing the old model, with members of the Trans-European Networks for Energy adding smart electrical grids as one of three priority thematic areas. To support such targets, Slovenia and Croatia have successfully pioneered a cross-border smart grid initiative, improving accessibility and integration of renewable energy. Continuing towards a fully integrated European energy market, France and Germany have also launched a project to structure a cross-border energy optimization project. Regulation of critical infrastructure, like grids, is paramount to ensure safety, security and reliability of new technologies. Addressing this, the European union’s new AI Act will look to ensure robust risk management systems are in place. For grid application, this means AI models need to be rigorously validated, ethically implemented and in full compliance with power grid governance standards. In the US, the incoming administration’s regulatory stance on AI remains unclear. However, this ambiguity presents a significant opportunity to put in place a global, unified approach that enables innovation, while ensuring the right safeguards are in place. Aerial of power grid plant. Beyond the grid, other aspects of our infrastructure also demand innovation and regulation. With the age of hydropower facilities in the U.S. averaging over 70 years, the need for predictive maintenance has become increasingly urgent. Advancements in AI through the US Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory are now enabling energy providers to forecast wear and tear as well as providing them with a prognosis on expected lifespan. AI also supports ushering in new infrastructure at various stages of the energy value chain from business development, construction, production and consumption to health and safety and corporate social responsibility. For example, AI can optimize the placement of renewables like hydropower dams, wind farms, solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations. It can go on to streamline the distribution of energy, optimize pricing, and aid with energy compliance standards by processing data from population, traffic and grid availability figures. Contributing to autonomous vehicle development, AI can improve safety and efficiency while reducing traffic accidents and energy consumption. AI applications are also being used in agriculture to enable precision farming, providing valuable insights into crop health, soil conditions, and irrigation needs, enabling farmers to make better use of resources, and reduce environmental impact.

From our homes to industrial settings, Building Management Systems are integrating AI capabilities to cut out needless energy use. AI-powered sensors can predict our daily power usage patterns to optimize heating, cooling and ventilation, as well as lighting, water management, and fire safety. Other AI solutions combine data with real-time emission figures from drones or satellites to detect bottlenecks and opportunities for optimization. But placing greater demand on our data centers is putting increasing pressure on the grid. According to Morgan Stanley Research, by 2027 AI's power demands may equal Spain’s 2022 energy consumption. Without careful management, this added energy demand could hinder sustainability efforts. Engineer manager check and control automation robot arms machine in intelligent industrial factory ...

Launched with several partners, their Net Zero Innovation Hub connects European data centers with the energy and utilities sectors, to collectively accelerate net zero goals.

Aiming to mobilize of up to $100 billion, the partnership will bring together financial and industry leaders to build new energy infrastructure and power it sustainably. Other investments include Blackstone’s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk which will facilitate the growing demands of AI and cloud computing in the Asia-Pacific, while remaining committed to achieving 100% renewable energy by 2030.

This optimistic vision has spurred the emergence of Green AI, a cause championing AI-driven solutions to achieve a more sustainable, clean-energy future. However, realizing this requires a collective commitment to action from businesses and governments alike, ultimately ensuring that the energy consumed by data centers and machine learning is clean. Without this, we will create more CO2 to abate CO2. It would be like chasing our own tail. Together with the modernization of energy infrastructure and clear, stable regulation, these efforts can turn the promise of Green AI into a reality. One Community. Many Voices.

Mutual funds offer diversification, income and long-term growth potential. As investors seek professional portfolio management and diversification, mutual funds remain a cornerstone of long-term investment strategies for growth and income. For 2025, I've identified five outstanding funds that offer a combination of strong management teams, proven track records and attractive prospects across different investment styles and asset classes. My selection process focused on funds with consistent long-term performance, experienced management teams and reasonable expenses. I evaluated risk-adjusted returns, manager tenure, fund strategy consistency and asset growth management. Special consideration was given to funds that have successfully navigated different market cycles while maintaining their investment discipline and demonstrating strong risk management practices.

The fund maintains a diversified portfolio of roughly 300 stocks, biased toward large-cap growth companies. Fidelity Contrafund's appeal stems from its exceptional combination of seasoned management and proven stock selection ability. Under Danoff's leadership, the fund has outperformed its benchmark in 24 of the past 32 years, generating an alpha of 2.9% annually over the S&P 500. The fund's proprietary research process, supported by Fidelity's 200-plus analyst team, has consistently identified emerging growth leaders early–including significant positions in Meta and Nvidia before their massive runs. Despite its large asset base, the fund has maintained its performance edge with a sophisticated trading approach that resulted in an implementation shortfall of just 0.15% in 2024. The strategy's focus on companies with sustainable competitive advantages has led to superior downside protection, capturing only 85% of market declines while participating in 95% of upside moves over the past decade. Key Metrics: Growth Fund of America utilizes American Funds' distinctive multiple portfolio counselor system, with each manager independently running a portion of the fund's assets. This approach combines diverse investment perspectives while focusing on high-quality growth companies. Growth Fund of America distinguishes itself through its unique multi-manager system and remarkable consistency. The fund's team of 12 portfolio counselors, averaging 25 years of experience, has delivered excess returns of 2.1% annually over its benchmark for the past decade.

The fund's low expense ratio of 0.62% is impressive given its active management approach and extensive global research capabilities. Portfolio construction excellence is evident in the fund's sector allocation decisions, which added 175 basis points of excess return in 2024. The fund's low turnover of 25% demonstrates its long-term investment approach, resulting in tax efficiency with a tax-cost ratio of just 0.45% annually.

Title: Super Micro's Shocking Fall: Nasdaq Exit, Stock Plunge, and Capital Raise Chaos

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is in free fall, with shares tanking 12% in premarket trading on Monday. This comes hot on the heels of Friday's announcement that it's getting booted from the Nasdaq-100 Index, effective December 23. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Axon Enterprise (AXON are stepping in, replacing Super Micro, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). For Super Micro, the move caps a brutal nine months that saw its stock lose nearly 70% of its value since hitting a record $118.8 in March. The company's troubles have snowballed, from missed earnings expectations to a delayed annual report filing, auditor resignations, and a Department of Justice probe triggered by short-seller allegations. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMCI. But the hits keep coming. Bloomberg dropped another bombshell, reporting that Super Micro has hired Evercore to explore capital-raising options, including equity sales, debt financing, or private equity investments. This isn't the company's first trip down the capital-raising laneback in March, it sold 2 million new shares to drum up $2 billion. Now, with governance concerns lingering and a February deadline to file overdue reports to avoid Nasdaq delisting, Super Micro is walking a tightrope. Meanwhile, its pivot to BDO as its new auditor underscores a desperate attempt to restore credibility, but investors are clearly skeptical. Here's the bottom line: Super Micro is teetering on the edge. The Nasdaq removal is a glaring red flag, and while the potential capital raise could buy some breathing room, the company's underlying issuesgovernance gaps, financial reporting delays, and a shrinking market caparen't going away anytime soon. For investors, this might be a wait-and-watch game, but with every misstep, the odds of a turnaround get slimmer. The question now is whether Super Micro can stabilize or if it's destined to be a cautionary tale for growth stocks gone wrong. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Title: Ethena Rolls Out Stablecoin Backed by BlackRock's BUIDL Token
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/16/ethena-rolls-out-stablecoin-backed-by-black-rocks-buidl-token

Red-hot decentralized finance (DeFi) project Ethena said Monday it is rolling out its new stablecoin that aims to help stabilize the protocol's flagship USDe token when crypto markets turn bearish. The USDtb token aims to keep a steady $1 price and holds 90% of its reserves in BUIDL, the tokenized money market fund issued by asset management behemoth BlackRock and tokenization firm Securitize. "In light of the rapidly accelerating demand for different stablecoin options, we saw a clear opportunity to provide a new product that offers users an entirely different risk profile from USDe without them having to leave our trusted ecosystem,” Ethena founder Guy Young said in a statement. Ethena is one of the fastest-growing DeFi platforms this year, attracting nearly $6 billion of user funds since its public launch in early 2024. The protocol's flagship token USDe, marketed as a "synthetic dollar" with a steady $1 price, generates yield to investors by shorting bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) perpetual swaps and farming the funding rates. This investment strategy offers lofty yields – currently 27% annualized – when crypto markets are in bull mode, but can quickly turn unprofitable when things turn bearish with persistently negative funding rates. The new offering will allow Ethena close the underlying derivatives positions behind USDe and divert the backing assets to USDtb during periods of negative funding rates and mitigating risks, the Ethena team explained. The protocol also aspires to get USDtb accepted as collateral in the future for margin trading on centralized exchanges. Read more: Tokenized Treasuries: A Game-Changer for Collateral in Crypto Markets Ethena enlisted Copper, Zodia Custody, Komainu, and Coinbase Institutional as custodians for USDtb, according to a press release. Liquidity providers for the token include Jump, Cumberland, Amber Group, GSR Markets and SCB Limited. Ethena also applied with the new USDtb stablecoin for Sky's, formerly MakerDAO, so-called Tokenization Gran Prix program that aims to invest up to $1 billion funds in tokenized real-world asset (RWA) products. The protocol's governance token recently garnered the attention of President-elect Donald Trump DeFi project World Liberty Financial, which purchased some $500,000 worth of tokens on Saturday, blockchain data showed. ENA subsequently rallied 25% over the weekend before paring some of the advance on Monday.

Title: 2024 was big for bitcoin. States could see a crypto policy blitz in 2025 in spite of the risks
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/12/16/states-crypto-policy-2025-donald-trump-bitcoin/

By MARC LEVY, Associated PressHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses that, together, could push states to become more open to crypto and for public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it.Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to criticize government-backed currencies as prone to devaluation and say increased government buy-in will stabilize bitcoin’s future price swings, give it more legitimacy and further boost an already rising price.But the risks are significant. Critics say a crypto investment is highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting its future returns, and warn that investors should be prepared to lose money.Only a couple public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency and a new U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued in recent days, warned it has “uniquely high volatility” and that it found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto.It has already been a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin hitting $100,000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts being cheered by Trump’s promise to make the United States the “bitcoin superpower” of the world.More legislation on crypto could be comingLawmakers in more states can expect to see bills in 2025 to make them crypto-friendly as analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby, bitcoin miners build new installations and venture capitalists underwrite a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback.FILE — Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at the Bitcoin 2024 Conferenc, July 27, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File)A bill introduced last month in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives sought to authorize the state’s treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir.“I had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, ‘Oh my god, I’m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,’ more than he ever did about any other bill,” said the measure’s sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell.Cabell — a bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid — expects his bill to be reintroduced by a colleague. And leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect bills based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states next year.But what about public pension funds?Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn’t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto.Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek.“There might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,” Brainard said. “But it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.”In Louisiana, Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system by which people can pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies.Fleming said he’s not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather sees the step as a recognition that government must innovate and be flexible in helping people make financial transactions with the state.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses that, together, could push states to become more open to crypto and for public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it. Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to criticize government-backed currencies as prone to devaluation and say increased government buy-in will stabilize bitcoin’s future price swings, give it more legitimacy and further boost an already rising price. But the risks are significant. Critics say a crypto investment is highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting its future returns, and warn that investors should be prepared to lose money. Only a couple public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency and a new U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued in recent days, warned it has “uniquely high volatility” and that it found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto. It has already been a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin hitting $100,000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts being cheered by Trump’s promise to make the United States the “bitcoin superpower” of the world. Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills in 2025 to make them crypto-friendly as analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby, bitcoin miners build new installations and venture capitalists underwrite a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback. A bill introduced last month in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives sought to authorize the state’s treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir. “I had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, ‘Oh my god, I’m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,’ more than he ever did about any other bill,” said the measure’s sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell. Cabell — a bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid — expects his bill to be reintroduced by a colleague. And leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect bills based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states next year. Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn’t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto. Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek. “There might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,” Brainard said. “But it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.” In Louisiana, Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system by which people can pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies. Fleming said he’s not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather sees the step as a recognition that government must innovate and be flexible in helping people make financial transactions with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state’s, in crypto. Fleming recalled meeting with a bitcoin lobbyist recently and came away unconvinced that bitcoin makes for a good investment. “My concern is that at some point it’ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,” Fleming said. “And when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.” In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency’s investment standards under state law and don’t need new legislation. Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency’s need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said.

Share this article MicroStrategy announced today it had acquired 15,350 BTC worth around $1.5 billion between December 9-15, marking its sixth consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases. The announcement comes ahead of its inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 index, which takes effect next Monday. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD. As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/SaWLNBVkrl — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 16, 2024 MicroStrategy funded the acquisition through the sale of 3,884,712 shares, generating net proceeds of about $1.5 billion, according to an SEC filing. MicroStrategy maintains $7.6 billion in available funds from its $21 billion at-market share sale facility for future Bitcoin purchases. The latest acquisition increases MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC, valued at $45 billion at current market prices, representing over 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply. The company’s Bitcoin investments have yielded strong returns, with a 72.4% yield year-to-date as of December 15. According to Google Finance data, MSTR has been among Nasdaq’s best-performing stocks this year, with a remarkable 547% year-to-date increase. This surge qualified the company for inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. On December 13, Nasdaq announced its annual reconstitution of the Nasdaq-100 index, which saw three companies, including MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies, and Axon Enterprise, added. The market reacted positively, with MicroStrategy shares rising from $411 at Friday’s close to $434 in Monday’s pre-market trading, Yahoo Finance data shows. Inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will probably help MicroStrategy achieve its ambitious goal of accumulating $42 billion worth of Bitcoin. The company is expected to have greater financial flexibility to continue its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

The tech graveyard is ending 2024 with a few new inhabitants. Throughout the year, companies put aging products out to pasture and billion-dollar deals ended with curt blog posts about focusing their efforts (and dollars) elsewhere. It was the end of the road for products big and small, old and new. Here's a look back at those that ended their run in 2024. In some circles, the Kardashians are no longer the money-making juggernauts they once were, and we saw evidence of that in January with the demise of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The mobile fashion game debuted to chuckles more than a decade ago (“shallow, addictive fun,” we said in our 2014 review), but it quickly raked in millions for the eponymous reality star. Still, nothing lasts forever in Hollywood. “I’ve realized that it’s time to focus that energy into other passions,” Kim said in announcing the shutdown. Meta dumped non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2023, and X followed suit this year by dropping the ability to create NFT profile photos. The social network first started experimenting with them in 2022 as a perk for premium subscribers, but interest has waned as crypto bros failed to adequately explain why anyone would pay top dollar for what is basically a JPG. Case in point: an NFT of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet initially sold for $2.9 million in 2021 but only fetched $280 on the resale market a year later. Artifact, the news app created by Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, shut down in January, less than a year after its debut. “We have concluded that the market opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment,” Systrom said at the time. (Krieger is now the chief product officer at AI company Anthropic.) It was a rocky month for news startups, with The Messenger also abruptly closing up shop after throwing tons of money at high-profile journalists in an effort to combat “bias in the news.” In 2021, Uber spent more than $1 billion on alcohol-delivery service Drizly. But unlike Uber Eats, Drizly didn’t have Uber drivers deliver booze; it was a back-end system for liquor stores to facilitate deliveries they handled themselves. Complicating matters was a cybersecurity issue that Drizly failed to address, resulting in hefty FTC fines. By January, Uber said it would shut down Drizly to “focus on our core Uber Eats strategy of helping consumers get almost anything — from food to groceries to alcohol — all on a single app.” AMD’s Link app debuted in 2017 and allowed Radeon graphics card owners to stream PC games—including VR titles—to their smartphones. Seven years later, “there are many options available for users to stream their PC content to other devices,” AMD said, so it released a driver update that officially killed the Link app. Apple and Samsung dominate the US smartwatch market; it’s hard to compete with watchOS and the Galaxy brand. Fossil saw the writing on the wall this year and dropped out of the market. The Gen 6, released in 2021, will be Fossil’s last smartwatch, though it plans to keep the device updated “for the next few years.” British phone manufacturer Bullitt Group shut down in late January amid financial trouble. It was known for its rugged, Caterpillar-branded phones, like the Cat S60, Cat S40, and Cat S61, which offered the ability to measure air quality. In 2022, Bullitt tried to "pivot away from hardware" toward a satellite offering, including a clip-on device that enables satellite messaging for any smartphone, but that never got off the ground. It's estimated that 38% of web pages from 2013 no longer exist, a phenomenon known as link rot. For years, Google took and stored snapshots of web pages as it crawled them, giving users an archived view if a site went down. It also made it easy to see if any changes had been made to a web page, a helpful tool for journalists and search engine optimization specialists. In February, Google quietly pulled the plug because it was developed for a time when you “couldn't depend on a page loading,” it said. More recently, Google partnered with the Internet Archive to offers links to its Wayback Machine directly from search results (though the Internet Archive itself almost got added to this list this year). The Ring Car Cam launched at CES 2023 and worked as a dash cam while your vehicle was in motion and as a security camera when parked. In our 2023 review, we liked the Ring Cam's dual-camera imaging and 1080p video as well as its inclusion of the GPS locator. However, we were disappointed with the number of integration options available for the device and thought the camera was pricey, especially with an added subscription. After ongoing delivery delays, Ring decided to discontinue the device. The writing’s been on the wall for Funimation since 2021, when Sony acquired Crunchyroll for almost $1.2 billion and announced plans to merge the two anime streaming services. The larger Crunchyroll took priority, and Sony this year said the Funimation app and website would shut down on April 2, 2024. On the downside, Crunchyroll does not support Funimation Digital copies, meaning exclusive DVD and Blu-ray content purchased in digital form from Funimation is no longer accessible. This year’s Paramount layoffs took out the team behind kid-focused streaming service Noggin. Shows like Blue’s Clues & You, Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig made the leap to Paramount+. Skiff offered private email, storage, a calendar, and collaboration tools that were simple, forward-looking, and free. In our initial review last year, Skiff earned an Editors’ Choice award, but in February, Skiff announced it would no longer exist as a separate entity after its acquisition by productivity service Notion. All Skiff services ended on Aug. 9, except for email forwarding, which will continue until Feb. 9, 2025. Introduced in 2018, Mozilla Hubs was intended as a meeting place for those using virtual reality. You could go to the site, click a button, and generate a VR room with a share link. In 2022, the first public beta opened to subscribers for $20 a month. Earlier this year, however, Mozilla said it would shut down Hubs as part of a larger company restructuring, resulting in the end of the Hubs Demo Server and subscription service. Rumors about Apple producing a vehicle swirled for years before Bloomberg reported that the company had formally axed plans for an Apple car. Originally known as Project Titan, the EV endeavor was expected to become a major new business for Cupertino, which reportedly poured billions into the effort. But the company’s board was skeptical, dooming the effort (for now). The ability to run Android apps was a highly touted Windows 11 feature, but a big drawback was that it tapped into Amazon’s limited Amazon Appstore, not Google Play. The feature went live in July 2023, but by March, Microsoft updated its documentation to say that support for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) would end on March 5, 2025. As PCMag’s Michael Muchmore noted, “It was a neat idea to be able to run mobile apps on your desktop, but…if you have a compatible Android phone, you get a better experience running apps via the Phone Link app.” This tool, which Facebook acquired in 2016, allowed publishers to track high-performing social media posts but also helped researchers and fact-checkers monitor bad actors on Facebook Pages, Groups, Instagram accounts, and—before API access was restricted—Twitter/X and Reddit. In March, Meta said it would shut down CrowdTangle and shift to its own Meta Content Library. Lawmakers urged Meta to delay the shutdown, arguing that the Content Library was more limited than CrowdTangle, to no avail. It closed up shop for good in August. Pandemic-era lockdowns prompted streaming services to launch watch parties that allowed us to Netflix and not-quite chill from our own homes. Amazon-owned Twitch’s solution offered a way for streamers to connect with fans via movies or shows streaming on Prime Video. It was a great alternative to watching someone play a game, but Watch Party usage declined dramatically as lockdowns lifted, so Amazon shut down the service to focus on other features. The VPN industry is crowded, and a few major player threw in the towel this year. Atlas VPN, a service with 6 million users, shut down in April, citing competition and rising costs. It migrated users to NordVPN, whose parent company acquired Atlas VPN in 2021. Atlas was supposed to remain independent while growing its freemium business after the merger, but it “encountered insurmountable challenges," Atlas VPN said. A month later, Google said it would pull the plug on the VPN that's included with Google One because “we found people simply weren't using it.” For Atlas customers, NordVPN is at least a top-rated VPN service, but check out our picks for the fastest VPNs and best free VPNs, too. Amazon has been experimenting with cashier-less technology for a few years, starting with its Amazon Go stores in 2016. It let shoppers grab things off shelves and leave the store without checking out; everything was tabulated as you shopped using a maze of sensors and charged to your Amazon account after you left. It expanded to Whole Foods and even select Starbucks, but started to wind down last year. In April, Amazon confirmed that it would transition from “Just Walk Out” tech in large grocery stores to speciality “Dash Carts,” where you manually scan items. It’s not completely ditching “Just Walk Out,” but it’s now positioned as a service Amazon is providing to third parties. A few “Just Walk Out” stores are still open internationally. Remember Alexa Skills? When Amazon debuted its Alexa-powered Echo devices a decade ago, it allowed developers to create “skills” that you called up with specific words or phrases. In 2017, Amazon added a rewards program that paid developers with high customer engagement and handed out millions of dollars in 2018. By 2020, however, it had scaled back and the program shut down in April. “These older programs have simply run their course, so we decided to sunset them," Amazon said. Developers can still make money from in-app payments. DALL-E 2 took the world by storm in April 2022 thanks to its ability to generate impressively high-quality images from simple text prompts. A few months later, OpenAI opened the beta to a broader audience, but it's since been eclipsed by DALL-E 3, which includes full integration with ChatGPT, making for a simpler interface that produces even better images. This delivery service picked up steam during the pandemic when people were stuck at home looking for quick access to groceries and other convenience items. It launched in 2015 in Turkey with a promise of deliveries in 13 minutes from drivers clad in the brand’s purple and yellow colors, and expanded to the US in 2021. Its valuation quickly ballooned, and it acquired US grocery-delivery service FreshDirect last year. But like Kozmo.com before it, interest dwindled as early discounts disappeared and people emerged from lockdowns and returned to buying their own groceries. By May, Getir shut down its US and European operations. “Facebook for work” always sounded like a terrible idea, but someone at Meta thought we’d all be curious to know what Anne in accounting had for lunch or how to help the C-Suite leverage its core competencies. Workplace debuted almost a decade ago as Facebook at Work, positioned as a useful way for those in non-traditional offices to communicate—helping retail workers, ship crews, or baristas stay connected from a phone or tablet, for example. That didn’t really catch on, however, and in May, Meta announced plans to shut down Workplace “so we can focus on building AI and metaverse technologies.” You have until Aug. 31, 2025, to log into Workplace and pour one out for cross-functional synergies and maybe shift a few paradigms. Google moved to simplify its mobile payment apps this summer by folding the Google Pay app into Google Wallet. According to Google, the Wallet app saw five times the usage of Pay, so it made sense to focus on Wallet. On the downside, the shutdown meant that Google Pay users lost the ability to send and receive money, forcing them to migrate to one of several non-Google-operated alternatives, such as PayPal, PayPal-owned Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle. After almost three decades, once-popular instant messaging client ICQ finally shut down on June 26, an unceremonious end for a software program that helped kick off instant messaging on PCs in the 1990s. ICQ, which stands for "I Seek You," was originally developed at an Israeli company called Mirabilis before AOL bought it in 1998 for $407 million. Twelve years later, AOL then sold it to Russian social media company VK (then known as DST). VK recommended that ICQ users migrate to one of its messaging platforms following the shutdown. Providing broadband subsidies for low-income households might seem like a no-brainer, but Congress couldn’t get it together this year to renew funding for The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated $30 per month ($75 on qualifying Tribal lands) for those with household incomes up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines, those participating in Medicaid, or anyone with a child who received free or reduced-cost school lunches. Approximately 23 million households signed up. Some ISPs tried to fill the gap at lower rates, but it wasn’t enough. Despite a big push from the White House to renew funding, multiple bipartisan bills introduced in the House and Senate went nowhere. Ted Cruz breathed a sigh of relief this summer when X announced it would make the “like” tab on people’s profiles private. Musk framed it as a way for people to “like posts without getting attacked,” but many argued it just allowed users to escape scrutiny for liking objectionable content. Like counts still remain on X, and you can still see your own likes. But only the author of a tweet can see who liked a post. It’s not completely without precedent. In 2019, for example, Instagram dropped the “following” tab, which put people’s likes, comments, and follows into a public news feed. Rivals like Threads and Bluesky also don’t have a way to see a person’s likes. Apple Pay Later was the company’s answer to "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) options from firms like Klarna, allowing users to make a purchase and pay for it over time, but with the added bonus of no fees. It launched to small group in March 2023, and became fully available in the US in October. By June, however, Apple said it would no longer offer its own loans. Instead, those on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 and up can select a BNPL option at checkout, but the loans will be handled by third parties lenders. Amazon launched the Business version of its Astro robot in November 2023 as a security guard for small and medium-sized businesses. Each unit was $2,350 and came with four months of Ring Protect Pro and Astro Security. Like the consumer version, Astro for Business had an HD periscope camera, night vision, 24/7 live view, and two-way talk. In a July email to employees, however, an Amazon exec said the company would be focusing on home robotics, "so we've made the decision to wind down the Astro for Business program." Businesses that purchased the device were promised a full refund and a $300 credit toward a replacement solution. Also on the chopping block from Amazon in July was the version of its Echo Dot smart speaker with an LED clock. It earned an "Excellent" 4 out of 5 rating from PCMag and an Editors' Choice award, in part for adding visible information like song titles and weather conditions on the most recent version. But after Amazon resurrected the Echo Spot with a small display, it discontinued the Echo Dot with Clock. In July, Google hit the kill switch on the Google URL Shortener. It dates back to 2009 and was created in response to the rise of Twitter and its 140-character limit. Since then, the web and social media landscape has changed dramatically, and by 2018, Google said it was diverting resources away from its URL shortener. All goo.gl links now display a warning message and will no longer work after Aug. 25, 2025. Late last year, Meta rolled out celebrity chatbots on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. But while these chats featured images of celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady, you weren’t actually talking to them. The most you got was a looping video of the celebrity reacting to your messages with different facial expressions. They didn’t talk back. It was a little weird, and by July, Meta scrapped the whole thing. In the fall, Meta instead partnered with a new crop of celebrities to embed their real voices into its Meta AI assistant, including Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. It’s rough out there for digital media. Shortly after decades of MTV News content was wiped from the web, Game Informer closed up shop after 33 years. It was one of the few remaining video game magazines, but earlier this year, owner GameStop pulled the plug on the print and online versions of the publication. These days, tech companies are trying to one-up each other with their AI tools, but back in 2017, the social networks were engaged in a face-filter war. Meta (then Facebook) went after Snapchat with eight face filter options, which evolved into the Spark AR platform that allowed third-party developers to create their own smartphone-based AR filters. But 2024 is not 2017; silly overlays have given way to undetectable beauty filters. As such, Spark AR is shutting down and third-party tools and content will be wiped, effective Jan. 14, 2025, news that shocked and angered many creators. First-party effects owned by Meta will remain. Boomerang, which launched in 2017, was known for its library of popular animated shows, which include Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes, and Bugs Bunny, among others. But in August, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would shut down the app and website for its classic cartoon streamer on Sept. 30. Existing Boomerang subscriptions were automatically transferred to the ad-free version of Max, but that does not include the full library. The Echo Show 8 Photos Edition launched in September 2023 alongside the third-gen Echo Show 8 and Echo Hub. It cost $10 more than the base Echo Show 8 and required a $2-per-month subscription to Amazon’s PhotosPlus service after a six-month free trial. It turned the device into more of a digital photo frame and added 25GB of storage through Amazon Photos. But Amazon axed PhotosPlus in late September and inserted ads into photo slideshows. Buyers could keep the 25GB of storage. For a time, the Kindle Oasis was Amazon’s most luxurious ebook reader, in part because it was the only device in the lineup that was waterproof. There was also an ergonomic grip, but as Amazon updated its Kindle lineup, the Oasis’ features didn’t really justify a $249.99 price tag. When it launched the latest Kindles, including the Colorsoft, Amazon confirmed to The Verge that it was pulling the Oasis from its lineup. Before there was the Vision Pro, there was the HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset that dates back to 2016. Microsoft marketed it as an enterprise device, and secured a US Army contract for use on the battlefield. But it seems that not enough people wanted to slap on an AR headset at work, and Redmond announced in October that it would sunset the latest version, the HoloLens 2. It will get updates until the end of 2027, but support for the original HoloLens ended on Dec. 10. The Pentagon contract is unchanged, however. In early October, Enel X, the company that makes the JuiceBox EV charger, abruptly shut down operations in the US and Canada. Initially, those with Juicebox home chargers were out of luck as Enel X had no plans to continue providing customer support. After some backlash, JuiceBox reached an agreement with a software provider to keep the JuiceBox software and mobile app alive "for an extended period." ChargeLab stepped in to assist with commercial chargers, but declined to do the same for residential ones "given the complexities of the migration process." The business was auctioned off at the end of October, though it's unclear who picked it up and what it means for existing JuiceBox owners. With October’s Windows 11 2024 update, WordPad was officially added to Microsoft's list of deprecated features. This basic word processor and document editor had been installed by default on Windows computers since the launch of Windows 95. In 2020, it was made an optional Windows feature, allowing people to uninstall it. Microsoft now recommends Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt." Announced in May, the Snapdragon Dev Kit mini PC was supposed to launch a month later to help developers create Windows applications that were natively compatible with chips manufactured by semiconductor giant Arm. However, in an Oct. 17 email to developers, Qualcomm said the kit had "not met our usual standards of excellence" and would be canceled. Customers who preordered the device were promised a refund from Qualcomm. Launched in 2021 on the Kindle app and Amazon website, Kindle Vella allowed authors to publish stories one short episode at a time. The model was supposed to give authors a new way to earn royalties, but "Kindle Vella hasn’t caught on as we’d hoped," Amazon said in October. As of Dec. 4, the platform stopped allowing authors to publish stories and readers to purchase tokens. If readers have any tokens left, they can use them to unlock stories until February. Paint 3D launched in 2017 and combined the Microsoft Paint and 3D Builder applications to create a hybrid 2D-3D editing experience. Microsoft then tried to deprecate the original Paint, creating an uproar among fans, prompting it to clarify that MS Paint would be removed as a standard feature of Windows 10 but remain in the Windows Store. At the time, the company pointed to Paint 3D as the "new app for creativity," but that didn't last long. In 2021, 3D Viewer and Paint 3D were removed from the default app install list on Windows 10, meaning you had to install it from the store. Last month, Paint 3D was deprecated and removed from the Microsoft Store entirely. Many of you were probably not aware that TikTok had its own version of Spotify, known as TikTok Music, likely because it only launched in Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Singapore. But despite the fact that TikTok has been a boon for many artists whose songs are used in creators’ videos, that didn’t translate to the music-streaming business. As a TikTok exec told The Wall Street Journal, ByteDance would shut down TikTok Music to “focus on our goal of furthering TikTok’s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry.” In 2017, Netflix began experimenting with interactive titles that added a "Choose Your Own Adventure" component to some of its originals, most notably with Black Mirror. But Netflix recently pulled the plug on most of the 24 interactive shows and movies on the platform, leaving only Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild. "The technology served its purpose but is now limiting as we focus on technological efforts in other areas," Netflix said. Sony's Airpeak S1 drone was marketed to serious videographers looking to send their Sony a1, a9 II, a7S III, a7R IV, and FX3 cameras into the skies. But its $9,000 price tag did not include the price of a camera, lens, gimbal, or even spare propellers. As PetaPixel explains, Sony struggled to compete with DJI and announced in November that "sales of the Airpeak S1 and related products, except for some accessories, will end at the end of March 2025." Amazon Freevee (previously IMDb Freedive and IMDb TV) was Amazon's ad-supported streaming service. It saw some success with shows like Jury Duty and Bosch: Legacy, but Amazon in November said it would shut down Freevee and fold the content into Prime Video. You don't have to pony up for Prime to keep watching; new episodes of Freevee originals will remain accessible to non-Prime subscribers. And there are plenty of other free video-streaming services. First introduced in 2022, LinkedIn Audio Events allowed people to create and host audio-only streams, where participants could log in and talk. However, as Dec. 2, users can no longer stream Audio Events on LinkedIn without using a third-party platform, though they can still record events using LinkedIn Live. When it launched Audio Events in 2022, LinkedIn pitched them as "a great way to connect with your followers, build relationships, and even unlock new career opportunities." They're "camera-free and pajama-friendly, so you can launch a conversation from anywhere." But it was late to the game following a pandemic-era boom in audio-only apps trying to replicate the success of Clubhouse. Last month, Microsoft ended support for the Mail, Calendar, and People apps on Windows 11. It will redirect users to the free version of Microsoft Outlook after Dec. 31, though they'll still be able to export emails, events, and contacts after that date. The move is part of Microsoft's broader push to get people to use its new AI-powered Outlook, which added new themes, easier-to-dismiss notifications, and more search features this month. Originally launched to a limited audience in October 2021, the $89.99 Car Thing allowed Spotify users to control the music-streaming service in their cars via voice recognition and preset buttons. Spotify stopped making its Car Thing in 2022 due to low demand and supply chain issues, but it continued to sell the device on its website at a discounted $49.99. This year, it announced the device would be discontinued and "no longer be operational" as of Dec. 9. Initially, there were no plans for refunds, but Spotify backtracked after buyers complained. You now have until Jan. 14, 2025, to get your money back. Microsoft’s pricey Surface Studio all-in-one PCs earned high marks in our reviews. The second-gen version debuted in 2018 as “a beautiful, pricey all-in-one desktop for artists, content creators, and professionals wedded to pen input,” we said, complete with “components peppier than the original's, and a downright stunning screen.” But that came at a premium; the version we tested was $4,199. Now, the Surface Studio is on the chopping block. The company confirms to Windows Central that it won’t be making any more Surface Studios once the current inventory runs out. We’re not exactly at a loss for messaging apps these days, which is maybe one reason Verizon ditched its Messages apps for iOS and Android. Verizon Messages, also known as Message+, supported MMS and SMS messages and group texts. The carrier is now recommending that Android users move to Google Messages while those on iOS use Apple Messages, but there are plenty of other options for secure chats. After a tough 2023 that saw robotaxi firm Cruise halt its driverless taxi operations following a pedestrian accident, the company seemed to be making a slow recovery in 2024. Its self-driving cars returned to the roads, albeit with human safety drivers, and the firm inked a deal with Uber. But after being hit with a $500,000 fine for failing to disclose details around last year's crash, Cruise's main source of funding—General Motors—pulled its financial backing, effectively killing the company. The move will save GM about $1 billion per year. Skype Credits let people pay to make traditional telephone calls, a convenient way to reach people still on landlines. Customers could buy credits in $5, $10 or $25 increments, but Skype owner Microsoft quietly updated its website to say that credits are no longer available. It's encouraging callers to instead buy monthly subscriptions, which vary in price and minutes depending on which countries you want to call, or to simply place Skype-to-Skype VoIP calls. When Foursquare launched at SXSW 2009, it promised an easy way to keep tabs on your friends' whereabouts and get recommendations for nearby restaurants, bars, and shops. But over the last decade, Foursquare's business has tilted increasingly toward providing location services to other businesses. Foursquare's City Guide app shut down this month, and its web version will expire early next year. Foursquare’s original check-in feature lives on in the company’s Swarm app. I started out covering tech policy in D.C. for The National Journal, where my beat included state-level tech news and all the congressional hearings and FCC meetings I could handle.

Title: Logging Off: The Tech That Died in 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-16T13:00:00Z

The tech graveyard is ending 2024 with a few new inhabitants. Throughout the year, companies put aging products out to pasture and billion-dollar deals ended with curt blog posts about focusing their efforts (and dollars) elsewhere. It was the end of the road for products big and small, old and new. Here's a look back at those that ended their run in 2024. In some circles, the Kardashians are no longer the money-making juggernauts they once were, and we saw evidence of that in January with the demise of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The mobile fashion game debuted to chuckles more than a decade ago (“shallow, addictive fun,” we said in our 2014 review), but it quickly raked in millions for the eponymous reality star. Still, nothing lasts forever in Hollywood. “I’ve realized that it’s time to focus that energy into other passions,” Kim said in announcing the shutdown. Meta dumped non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2023, and X followed suit this year by dropping the ability to create NFT profile photos. The social network first started experimenting with them in 2022 as a perk for premium subscribers, but interest has waned as crypto bros failed to adequately explain why anyone would pay top dollar for what is basically a JPG. Case in point: an NFT of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet initially sold for $2.9 million in 2021 but only fetched $280 on the resale market a year later. Artifact, the news app created by Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, shut down in January, less than a year after its debut. “We have concluded that the market opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment,” Systrom said at the time. (Krieger is now the chief product officer at AI company Anthropic.) It was a rocky month for news startups, with The Messenger also abruptly closing up shop after throwing tons of money at high-profile journalists in an effort to combat “bias in the news.” In 2021, Uber spent more than $1 billion on alcohol-delivery service Drizly. But unlike Uber Eats, Drizly didn’t have Uber drivers deliver booze; it was a back-end system for liquor stores to facilitate deliveries they handled themselves. Complicating matters was a cybersecurity issue that Drizly failed to address, resulting in hefty FTC fines. By January, Uber said it would shut down Drizly to “focus on our core Uber Eats strategy of helping consumers get almost anything — from food to groceries to alcohol — all on a single app.” AMD’s Link app debuted in 2017 and allowed Radeon graphics card owners to stream PC games—including VR titles—to their smartphones. Seven years later, “there are many options available for users to stream their PC content to other devices,” AMD said, so it released a driver update that officially killed the Link app. Apple and Samsung dominate the US smartwatch market; it’s hard to compete with watchOS and the Galaxy brand. Fossil saw the writing on the wall this year and dropped out of the market. The Gen 6, released in 2021, will be Fossil’s last smartwatch, though it plans to keep the device updated “for the next few years.” British phone manufacturer Bullitt Group shut down in late January amid financial trouble. It was known for its rugged, Caterpillar-branded phones, like the Cat S60, Cat S40, and Cat S61, which offered the ability to measure air quality. In 2022, Bullitt tried to "pivot away from hardware" toward a satellite offering, including a clip-on device that enables satellite messaging for any smartphone, but that never got off the ground. It's estimated that 38% of web pages from 2013 no longer exist, a phenomenon known as link rot. For years, Google took and stored snapshots of web pages as it crawled them, giving users an archived view if a site went down. It also made it easy to see if any changes had been made to a web page, a helpful tool for journalists and search engine optimization specialists. In February, Google quietly pulled the plug because it was developed for a time when you “couldn't depend on a page loading,” it said. More recently, Google partnered with the Internet Archive to offers links to its Wayback Machine directly from search results (though the Internet Archive itself almost got added to this list this year). The Ring Car Cam launched at CES 2023 and worked as a dash cam while your vehicle was in motion and as a security camera when parked. In our 2023 review, we liked the Ring Cam's dual-camera imaging and 1080p video as well as its inclusion of the GPS locator. However, we were disappointed with the number of integration options available for the device and thought the camera was pricey, especially with an added subscription. After ongoing delivery delays, Ring decided to discontinue the device. The writing’s been on the wall for Funimation since 2021, when Sony acquired Crunchyroll for almost $1.2 billion and announced plans to merge the two anime streaming services. The larger Crunchyroll took priority, and Sony this year said the Funimation app and website would shut down on April 2, 2024. On the downside, Crunchyroll does not support Funimation Digital copies, meaning exclusive DVD and Blu-ray content purchased in digital form from Funimation is no longer accessible. This year’s Paramount layoffs took out the team behind kid-focused streaming service Noggin. Shows like Blue’s Clues & You, Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig made the leap to Paramount+. Skiff offered private email, storage, a calendar, and collaboration tools that were simple, forward-looking, and free. In our initial review last year, Skiff earned an Editors’ Choice award, but in February, Skiff announced it would no longer exist as a separate entity after its acquisition by productivity service Notion. All Skiff services ended on Aug. 9, except for email forwarding, which will continue until Feb. 9, 2025. Introduced in 2018, Mozilla Hubs was intended as a meeting place for those using virtual reality. You could go to the site, click a button, and generate a VR room with a share link. In 2022, the first public beta opened to subscribers for $20 a month. Earlier this year, however, Mozilla said it would shut down Hubs as part of a larger company restructuring, resulting in the end of the Hubs Demo Server and subscription service. Rumors about Apple producing a vehicle swirled for years before Bloomberg reported that the company had formally axed plans for an Apple car. Originally known as Project Titan, the EV endeavor was expected to become a major new business for Cupertino, which reportedly poured billions into the effort. But the company’s board was skeptical, dooming the effort (for now). The ability to run Android apps was a highly touted Windows 11 feature, but a big drawback was that it tapped into Amazon’s limited Amazon Appstore, not Google Play. The feature went live in July 2023, but by March, Microsoft updated its documentation to say that support for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) would end on March 5, 2025. As PCMag’s Michael Muchmore noted, “It was a neat idea to be able to run mobile apps on your desktop, but…if you have a compatible Android phone, you get a better experience running apps via the Phone Link app.” This tool, which Facebook acquired in 2016, allowed publishers to track high-performing social media posts but also helped researchers and fact-checkers monitor bad actors on Facebook Pages, Groups, Instagram accounts, and—before API access was restricted—Twitter/X and Reddit. In March, Meta said it would shut down CrowdTangle and shift to its own Meta Content Library. Lawmakers urged Meta to delay the shutdown, arguing that the Content Library was more limited than CrowdTangle, to no avail. It closed up shop for good in August. Pandemic-era lockdowns prompted streaming services to launch watch parties that allowed us to Netflix and not-quite chill from our own homes. Amazon-owned Twitch’s solution offered a way for streamers to connect with fans via movies or shows streaming on Prime Video. It was a great alternative to watching someone play a game, but Watch Party usage declined dramatically as lockdowns lifted, so Amazon shut down the service to focus on other features. The VPN industry is crowded, and a few major player threw in the towel this year. Atlas VPN, a service with 6 million users, shut down in April, citing competition and rising costs. It migrated users to NordVPN, whose parent company acquired Atlas VPN in 2021. Atlas was supposed to remain independent while growing its freemium business after the merger, but it “encountered insurmountable challenges," Atlas VPN said. A month later, Google said it would pull the plug on the VPN that's included with Google One because “we found people simply weren't using it.” For Atlas customers, NordVPN is at least a top-rated VPN service, but check out our picks for the fastest VPNs and best free VPNs, too. Amazon has been experimenting with cashier-less technology for a few years, starting with its Amazon Go stores in 2016. It let shoppers grab things off shelves and leave the store without checking out; everything was tabulated as you shopped using a maze of sensors and charged to your Amazon account after you left. It expanded to Whole Foods and even select Starbucks, but started to wind down last year. In April, Amazon confirmed that it would transition from “Just Walk Out” tech in large grocery stores to speciality “Dash Carts,” where you manually scan items. It’s not completely ditching “Just Walk Out,” but it’s now positioned as a service Amazon is providing to third parties. A few “Just Walk Out” stores are still open internationally. Remember Alexa Skills? When Amazon debuted its Alexa-powered Echo devices a decade ago, it allowed developers to create “skills” that you called up with specific words or phrases. In 2017, Amazon added a rewards program that paid developers with high customer engagement and handed out millions of dollars in 2018. By 2020, however, it had scaled back and the program shut down in April. “These older programs have simply run their course, so we decided to sunset them," Amazon said. Developers can still make money from in-app payments. DALL-E 2 took the world by storm in April 2022 thanks to its ability to generate impressively high-quality images from simple text prompts. A few months later, OpenAI opened the beta to a broader audience, but it's since been eclipsed by DALL-E 3, which includes full integration with ChatGPT, making for a simpler interface that produces even better images. This delivery service picked up steam during the pandemic when people were stuck at home looking for quick access to groceries and other convenience items. It launched in 2015 in Turkey with a promise of deliveries in 13 minutes from drivers clad in the brand’s purple and yellow colors, and expanded to the US in 2021. Its valuation quickly ballooned, and it acquired US grocery-delivery service FreshDirect last year. But like Kozmo.com before it, interest dwindled as early discounts disappeared and people emerged from lockdowns and returned to buying their own groceries. By May, Getir shut down its US and European operations. “Facebook for work” always sounded like a terrible idea, but someone at Meta thought we’d all be curious to know what Anne in accounting had for lunch or how to help the C-Suite leverage its core competencies. Workplace debuted almost a decade ago as Facebook at Work, positioned as a useful way for those in non-traditional offices to communicate—helping retail workers, ship crews, or baristas stay connected from a phone or tablet, for example. That didn’t really catch on, however, and in May, Meta announced plans to shut down Workplace “so we can focus on building AI and metaverse technologies.” You have until Aug. 31, 2025, to log into Workplace and pour one out for cross-functional synergies and maybe shift a few paradigms. Google moved to simplify its mobile payment apps this summer by folding the Google Pay app into Google Wallet. According to Google, the Wallet app saw five times the usage of Pay, so it made sense to focus on Wallet. On the downside, the shutdown meant that Google Pay users lost the ability to send and receive money, forcing them to migrate to one of several non-Google-operated alternatives, such as PayPal, PayPal-owned Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle. After almost three decades, once-popular instant messaging client ICQ finally shut down on June 26, an unceremonious end for a software program that helped kick off instant messaging on PCs in the 1990s. ICQ, which stands for "I Seek You," was originally developed at an Israeli company called Mirabilis before AOL bought it in 1998 for $407 million. Twelve years later, AOL then sold it to Russian social media company VK (then known as DST). VK recommended that ICQ users migrate to one of its messaging platforms following the shutdown. Providing broadband subsidies for low-income households might seem like a no-brainer, but Congress couldn’t get it together this year to renew funding for The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated $30 per month ($75 on qualifying Tribal lands) for those with household incomes up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines, those participating in Medicaid, or anyone with a child who received free or reduced-cost school lunches. Approximately 23 million households signed up. Some ISPs tried to fill the gap at lower rates, but it wasn’t enough. Despite a big push from the White House to renew funding, multiple bipartisan bills introduced in the House and Senate went nowhere. Ted Cruz breathed a sigh of relief this summer when X announced it would make the “like” tab on people’s profiles private. Musk framed it as a way for people to “like posts without getting attacked,” but many argued it just allowed users to escape scrutiny for liking objectionable content. Like counts still remain on X, and you can still see your own likes. But only the author of a tweet can see who liked a post. It’s not completely without precedent. In 2019, for example, Instagram dropped the “following” tab, which put people’s likes, comments, and follows into a public news feed. Rivals like Threads and Bluesky also don’t have a way to see a person’s likes. Apple Pay Later was the company’s answer to "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) options from firms like Klarna, allowing users to make a purchase and pay for it over time, but with the added bonus of no fees. It launched to small group in March 2023, and became fully available in the US in October. By June, however, Apple said it would no longer offer its own loans. Instead, those on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 and up can select a BNPL option at checkout, but the loans will be handled by third parties lenders. Amazon launched the Business version of its Astro robot in November 2023 as a security guard for small and medium-sized businesses. Each unit was $2,350 and came with four months of Ring Protect Pro and Astro Security. Like the consumer version, Astro for Business had an HD periscope camera, night vision, 24/7 live view, and two-way talk. In a July email to employees, however, an Amazon exec said the company would be focusing on home robotics, "so we've made the decision to wind down the Astro for Business program." Businesses that purchased the device were promised a full refund and a $300 credit toward a replacement solution. Also on the chopping block from Amazon in July was the version of its Echo Dot smart speaker with an LED clock. It earned an "Excellent" 4 out of 5 rating from PCMag and an Editors' Choice award, in part for adding visible information like song titles and weather conditions on the most recent version. But after Amazon resurrected the Echo Spot with a small display, it discontinued the Echo Dot with Clock. In July, Google hit the kill switch on the Google URL Shortener. It dates back to 2009 and was created in response to the rise of Twitter and its 140-character limit. Since then, the web and social media landscape has changed dramatically, and by 2018, Google said it was diverting resources away from its URL shortener. All goo.gl links now display a warning message and will no longer work after Aug. 25, 2025. Late last year, Meta rolled out celebrity chatbots on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. But while these chats featured images of celebrities like Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady, you weren’t actually talking to them. The most you got was a looping video of the celebrity reacting to your messages with different facial expressions. They didn’t talk back. It was a little weird, and by July, Meta scrapped the whole thing. In the fall, Meta instead partnered with a new crop of celebrities to embed their real voices into its Meta AI assistant, including Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. It’s rough out there for digital media. Shortly after decades of MTV News content was wiped from the web, Game Informer closed up shop after 33 years. It was one of the few remaining video game magazines, but earlier this year, owner GameStop pulled the plug on the print and online versions of the publication. These days, tech companies are trying to one-up each other with their AI tools, but back in 2017, the social networks were engaged in a face-filter war. Meta (then Facebook) went after Snapchat with eight face filter options, which evolved into the Spark AR platform that allowed third-party developers to create their own smartphone-based AR filters. But 2024 is not 2017; silly overlays have given way to undetectable beauty filters. As such, Spark AR is shutting down and third-party tools and content will be wiped, effective Jan. 14, 2025, news that shocked and angered many creators. First-party effects owned by Meta will remain. Boomerang, which launched in 2017, was known for its library of popular animated shows, which include Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes, and Bugs Bunny, among others. But in August, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would shut down the app and website for its classic cartoon streamer on Sept. 30. Existing Boomerang subscriptions were automatically transferred to the ad-free version of Max, but that does not include the full library. The Echo Show 8 Photos Edition launched in September 2023 alongside the third-gen Echo Show 8 and Echo Hub. It cost $10 more than the base Echo Show 8 and required a $2-per-month subscription to Amazon’s PhotosPlus service after a six-month free trial. It turned the device into more of a digital photo frame and added 25GB of storage through Amazon Photos. But Amazon axed PhotosPlus in late September and inserted ads into photo slideshows. Buyers could keep the 25GB of storage. For a time, the Kindle Oasis was Amazon’s most luxurious ebook reader, in part because it was the only device in the lineup that was waterproof. There was also an ergonomic grip, but as Amazon updated its Kindle lineup, the Oasis’ features didn’t really justify a $249.99 price tag. When it launched the latest Kindles, including the Colorsoft, Amazon confirmed to The Verge that it was pulling the Oasis from its lineup. Before there was the Vision Pro, there was the HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset that dates back to 2016. Microsoft marketed it as an enterprise device, and secured a US Army contract for use on the battlefield. But it seems that not enough people wanted to slap on an AR headset at work, and Redmond announced in October that it would sunset the latest version, the HoloLens 2. It will get updates until the end of 2027, but support for the original HoloLens ended on Dec. 10. The Pentagon contract is unchanged, however. In early October, Enel X, the company that makes the JuiceBox EV charger, abruptly shut down operations in the US and Canada. Initially, those with Juicebox home chargers were out of luck as Enel X had no plans to continue providing customer support. After some backlash, JuiceBox reached an agreement with a software provider to keep the JuiceBox software and mobile app alive "for an extended period." ChargeLab stepped in to assist with commercial chargers, but declined to do the same for residential ones "given the complexities of the migration process." The business was auctioned off at the end of October, though it's unclear who picked it up and what it means for existing JuiceBox owners. With October’s Windows 11 2024 update, WordPad was officially added to Microsoft's list of deprecated features. This basic word processor and document editor had been installed by default on Windows computers since the launch of Windows 95. In 2020, it was made an optional Windows feature, allowing people to uninstall it. Microsoft now recommends Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt." Announced in May, the Snapdragon Dev Kit mini PC was supposed to launch a month later to help developers create Windows applications that were natively compatible with chips manufactured by semiconductor giant Arm. However, in an Oct. 17 email to developers, Qualcomm said the kit had "not met our usual standards of excellence" and would be canceled. Customers who preordered the device were promised a refund from Qualcomm. Launched in 2021 on the Kindle app and Amazon website, Kindle Vella allowed authors to publish stories one short episode at a time. The model was supposed to give authors a new way to earn royalties, but "Kindle Vella hasn’t caught on as we’d hoped," Amazon said in October. As of Dec. 4, the platform stopped allowing authors to publish stories and readers to purchase tokens. If readers have any tokens left, they can use them to unlock stories until February. Paint 3D launched in 2017 and combined the Microsoft Paint and 3D Builder applications to create a hybrid 2D-3D editing experience. Microsoft then tried to deprecate the original Paint, creating an uproar among fans, prompting it to clarify that MS Paint would be removed as a standard feature of Windows 10 but remain in the Windows Store. At the time, the company pointed to Paint 3D as the "new app for creativity," but that didn't last long. In 2021, 3D Viewer and Paint 3D were removed from the default app install list on Windows 10, meaning you had to install it from the store. Last month, Paint 3D was deprecated and removed from the Microsoft Store entirely. Many of you were probably not aware that TikTok had its own version of Spotify, known as TikTok Music, likely because it only launched in Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Singapore. But despite the fact that TikTok has been a boon for many artists whose songs are used in creators’ videos, that didn’t translate to the music-streaming business. As a TikTok exec told The Wall Street Journal, ByteDance would shut down TikTok Music to “focus on our goal of furthering TikTok’s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry.” In 2017, Netflix began experimenting with interactive titles that added a "Choose Your Own Adventure" component to some of its originals, most notably with Black Mirror. But Netflix recently pulled the plug on most of the 24 interactive shows and movies on the platform, leaving only Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild. "The technology served its purpose but is now limiting as we focus on technological efforts in other areas," Netflix said. Sony's Airpeak S1 drone was marketed to serious videographers looking to send their Sony a1, a9 II, a7S III, a7R IV, and FX3 cameras into the skies. But its $9,000 price tag did not include the price of a camera, lens, gimbal, or even spare propellers. As PetaPixel explains, Sony struggled to compete with DJI and announced in November that "sales of the Airpeak S1 and related products, except for some accessories, will end at the end of March 2025." Amazon Freevee (previously IMDb Freedive and IMDb TV) was Amazon's ad-supported streaming service. It saw some success with shows like Jury Duty and Bosch: Legacy, but Amazon in November said it would shut down Freevee and fold the content into Prime Video. You don't have to pony up for Prime to keep watching; new episodes of Freevee originals will remain accessible to non-Prime subscribers. And there are plenty of other free video-streaming services. First introduced in 2022, LinkedIn Audio Events allowed people to create and host audio-only streams, where participants could log in and talk. However, as Dec. 2, users can no longer stream Audio Events on LinkedIn without using a third-party platform, though they can still record events using LinkedIn Live. When it launched Audio Events in 2022, LinkedIn pitched them as "a great way to connect with your followers, build relationships, and even unlock new career opportunities." They're "camera-free and pajama-friendly, so you can launch a conversation from anywhere." But it was late to the game following a pandemic-era boom in audio-only apps trying to replicate the success of Clubhouse. Last month, Microsoft ended support for the Mail, Calendar, and People apps on Windows 11. It will redirect users to the free version of Microsoft Outlook after Dec. 31, though they'll still be able to export emails, events, and contacts after that date. The move is part of Microsoft's broader push to get people to use its new AI-powered Outlook, which added new themes, easier-to-dismiss notifications, and more search features this month. Originally launched to a limited audience in October 2021, the $89.99 Car Thing allowed Spotify users to control the music-streaming service in their cars via voice recognition and preset buttons. Spotify stopped making its Car Thing in 2022 due to low demand and supply chain issues, but it continued to sell the device on its website at a discounted $49.99. This year, it announced the device would be discontinued and "no longer be operational" as of Dec. 9. Initially, there were no plans for refunds, but Spotify backtracked after buyers complained. You now have until Jan. 14, 2025, to get your money back. Microsoft’s pricey Surface Studio all-in-one PCs earned high marks in our reviews. The second-gen version debuted in 2018 as “a beautiful, pricey all-in-one desktop for artists, content creators, and professionals wedded to pen input,” we said, complete with “components peppier than the original's, and a downright stunning screen.” But that came at a premium; the version we tested was $4,199. Now, the Surface Studio is on the chopping block. The company confirms to Windows Central that it won’t be making any more Surface Studios once the current inventory runs out. We’re not exactly at a loss for messaging apps these days, which is maybe one reason Verizon ditched its Messages apps for iOS and Android. Verizon Messages, also known as Message+, supported MMS and SMS messages and group texts. The carrier is now recommending that Android users move to Google Messages while those on iOS use Apple Messages, but there are plenty of other options for secure chats. After a tough 2023 that saw robotaxi firm Cruise halt its driverless taxi operations following a pedestrian accident, the company seemed to be making a slow recovery in 2024. Its self-driving cars returned to the roads, albeit with human safety drivers, and the firm inked a deal with Uber. But after being hit with a $500,000 fine for failing to disclose details around last year's crash, Cruise's main source of funding—General Motors—pulled its financial backing, effectively killing the company. The move will save GM about $1 billion per year. Skype Credits let people pay to make traditional telephone calls, a convenient way to reach people still on landlines. Customers could buy credits in $5, $10 or $25 increments, but Skype owner Microsoft quietly updated its website to say that credits are no longer available. It's encouraging callers to instead buy monthly subscriptions, which vary in price and minutes depending on which countries you want to call, or to simply place Skype-to-Skype VoIP calls. When Foursquare launched at SXSW 2009, it promised an easy way to keep tabs on your friends' whereabouts and get recommendations for nearby restaurants, bars, and shops. But over the last decade, Foursquare's business has tilted increasingly toward providing location services to other businesses. Foursquare's City Guide app shut down this month, and its web version will expire early next year. Foursquare’s original check-in feature lives on in the company’s Swarm app. I started out covering tech policy in D.C. for The National Journal, where my beat included state-level tech news and all the congressional hearings and FCC meetings I could handle.

Title: Wamco Clients, Staff Head for Exits as Ken Leech Heads to Court
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/wamco-clients-staff-head-for-exits-as-ken-leech-heads-to-court-11734353491083.html
Time Published: 2024-12-16T12:51:30Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Outwardly, all is upbeat at Western Asset Management, which has invited its staff and clients to celebrate the New Year by watching the Rose Parade from Wamco’s balconies in Pasadena, California, and cheer on the firm’s flower-bedecked entry, “Float Like a Butterfly.” The parade’s theme is “Best Day Ever!” The same can’t be said today for Wamco’s star bond trader, Ken Leech. He’s scheduled to appear in a Manhattan federal court Monday on fraud charges that have convulsed the investment firm and rippled through its owner, Franklin Resources Inc. Pension funds and other big clients have yanked vast sums since an investigation into his trading was disclosed in August — about $65 billion so far, with more withdrawals in the works. Inside Wamco, the staff is trying without much guidance from above to keep the firm operating while fretting about whether they should be exiting, too, according to more than a dozen people with knowledge of the situation. Jim Hirschmann, Wamco’s leader for more than two decades, has been rarely seen at the Pasadena headquarters, and Jenny Johnson, Franklin’s chief executive officer, has commented only briefly in public since Leech was charged. “It’s a difficult situation,” Johnson acknowledged last week at a Bloomberg conference in London. “There is never much upside to talking about a government investigation publicly.” Wamco abruptly replaced Hirschmann, 64, as CEO this month and moved him into the newly created post of chairman. The change came after US authorities accused Leech, Wamco’s former co-chief investment officer, of routinely waiting until late in the day to assign profitable trades to accounts that generated the most revenue, saddling other customers with losers. Franklin Impact The indictment late last month is a huge setback for Franklin, which had counted on the 2020 purchase of Wamco’s parent, Legg Mason, to broaden its business and stem persistent outflows of assets. Active managers like Franklin have been steadily losing ground to low-cost purveyors of index funds. Bloomberg Intelligence said at the time of the deal that it might be “key to Franklin’s survival.” Instead, the acquisition — which permitted Wamco to continue operating independently from Franklin — has turned into a financial and reputational fiasco. Franklin has already taken a roughly $390 million writedown on Wamco’s mutual fund business, and it’s facing an exodus of money along with the specter of its marquee manager appearing in a federal courtroom. The stock is down more than 25% this year. Hirschmann hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing in the federal cases. “Western Asset is a global company with offices across multiple continents,” said a Wamco representative. “As any CEO would, Jim spent a portion of his time traveling to other Western offices and meeting with clients across the globe.” Leech is on leave from Wamco and plans to fight the charges, which his lawyer says are unfounded. One Person Johnson portrayed the affair as isolated — “it was one person,” she told the conference attendees — and said Franklin is cooperating with investigators. She’s counting on Wamco’s remaining staff to turn things around. “The most important thing is that we still have a lot of clients invested in Western Asset,” Johnson said. “So we have made sure that we insulated the investment team from a lot of what’s going on with the investigation, so that we can ensure that they’re managing clients’ money and staying focused on that.” For some, it’s already too late. Defectors from the client list include the Marin County Employees’ Retirement Association, a customer for more than two decades with about $340 million. Almost $1 billion left with the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund. Hundreds of millions more was pulled by the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation, the Chicago Teachers’ Pension Fund, the Dallas Employees’ Retirement Fund and the Anne Arundel County retirement system. Some who remain, including the Fresno County Employees’ Retirement Association in California, are interviewing replacements. Selling Pressure Employee ranks are fraying, too. At least two department leaders have left, and rival asset managers are being inundated by resumes from Wamco staffers, according to some of the people familiar with the situation. The mood at Wamco is tense and the lack of direction so marked that a full takeover of operations by Franklin would be a welcome outcome, said some of the people, who asked for anonymity to protect their jobs and relationships. Staffers are showing up to work early in the morning knowing they’re probably just going to have hit the “sell” button to raise the cash needed to pay off clients who are leaving, some of the people said. The discontent is no small matter for an asset manager like Franklin. “People can walk out the door,” Johnson said at the Bloomberg conference. “It’s not like a lot of other types of businesses.” On the day of Leech’s indictment, Hirschmann and two senior executives wrote to clients saying Wamco had upgraded compliance systems and was “taking steps to invest in key personnel in our investment team and broader support functions, with an eye toward retention, to ensure continuity of the high-quality service you have come to expect.” Some executives who learned of their bonuses in recent weeks also were informed about a retention package, the people said. Others wonder if they will be offered similar encouragement or if it’s worth it to stay, given the concern about getting tainted by Wamco’s woes. Leech’s Expertise Interviews with people who’ve worked with Leech portray him as an exalted figure internally and externally, in part for his mastery of markets and love of history. He shunned the spotlight, resisting interviews and television spots. Instead, he led the firm’s investing group, coming up with views on economies and bonds around the world from the US to Mexico to Russia, on inflation and on the health of financial firms. What he liked to do was trade — and often. Starting early enough to catch the market open in New York, Leech himself would place dozens of trades a day, sometimes in his own office away from the trading floor or at home, the people said. Insiders would sometimes wonder what Leech was up to, only later finding him on the trading floor or calling an assistant around the end of the day with instructions about which accounts got his trades. Other traders used the company’s technology systems instead to accomplish that task. What Leech didn’t do, according to court filings, was follow the company’s own compliance training — and US law — that call for promptly allocating trades. For 34 months, authorities claim, Leech “cherry-picked” the winning trades based on first-day gains and losses, giving more than $600 million of them to the most profitable accounts for the firm and the ones benefiting his own wallet. The disfavored clients allegedly got over $600 million of losing wagers. His attorney, Jonathan Sack, says the allegations “ignore key facts, including the fundamental differences between distinct fixed-income strategies and the irrelevance of first-day performance to managing these strategies.” What’s more, he says, Leech didn’t benefit from the alleged misconduct. Hirschmann’s Leadership While Leech was the trading brain, Hirschmann, who started a year before Leech in 1989, was the client and sales guy who helped propel the firm to prominence, especially in the 1990s and early 2000s. Hirschmann hasn’t been a big presence at the firm for a while. He’d regularly be on the road with clients or traveling on his private plane, according to some of the people interviewed. When he was at the Pasadena headquarters, he’d arrive in his own special van and ascend to his fifth-floor office on a private elevator few others used. Hirschmann rarely stepped foot on the trading floor, the people said, but he focused on physical aspects of the office, personally choosing carpet colors for Wamco meeting rooms and snacks sold in the cafeteria. One employee in London remembers how all the window blinds had to be pulled to the same level when Hirschmann visited. The fall has been dramatic for Wamco, a bond manager so prestigious that it once rivaled the likes of Pacific Investment Management Co. and BlackRock Inc. Founded in 1971, Wamco was one of the original West Coast fixed-income firms that rode a bond bull market for decades. Money flowed in from investors across the US and abroad and bonuses were lavish. Leech himself recently got almost $30 million a year. By the time Johnson bought Wamco parent Legg Mason in 2020, Wamco was the crown jewel and Leech the star manager. The purchase included a promise of autonomy for Wamco that expires in 2025. Tighter Ties Some of that independence is already being reeled in. Johnson and Hirschmann told a company town hall — via video rather than in person — that middle- and back-office functions would be integrated more fully into Franklin. New firmwide technology is on the way, and Wamco insiders are speculating about whether the new regime portends changes for the actual trading and investment desks. In calls with larger clients, Franklin reps now outnumber Wamco managers, the people said. They’re being peppered with questions about Wamco’s future, potential job cuts and who will pay for lawsuits and whatever fines are imposed. Given the sums involved, legal action against the company may follow. Fernando Vinzons, CIO for the Chicago Teachers’ fund, which pulled $550 million, said it’s “evaluating all available options.” For his part, Hirschmann said in a Dec. 3 memo that the firm is looking forward to introducing clients to Tom Gahan, his replacement as CEO. But the public announcement from Franklin didn’t include an interim period that typically comes with a leadership change. Hirschmann’s handoff, the company said, was “effective immediately.” “Jim has been pivotal in building Western Asset and his commitment to the business has not changed,” a Wamco spokesperson said. As for the upcoming parade, Wamco has been in Pasadena for decades and participating in the event is part of the firm’s sense of civic duty, the spokesperson said. The invitation says guests can arrive as early as 6:30 a.m. for a breakfast buffet to watch the marching bands, equestrians and the firm’s float roll by, and celebrate “the opportunities for renewal that each new year brings.” The RSVPs are due today. --With assistance from Francine Lacqua.

Title: 'In AI we trust': Bank of America highlights 6 key chip stocks to own for 2025

Investing.com -- Bank of America outlined its 2025 semiconductor outlook on Monday, spotlighting six chip stocks it recommends for investors in the coming year. The bank forecasts a 15% increase in semiconductor industry sales to $725 billion in 2025. This growth, although robust, is projected to be slower compared to the 20% growth seen in the current year. BofA anticipates memory sales to rise by 20% in 2025, following a 79% year-over-year increase in 2024, with core semiconductors, excluding memory, expected to grow by 13%. “We see 2025 as a year of two different trends. In the first half, AI investments and NVDA Blackwell deployments driven by US cloud customers sustain momentum in AI semis,” analysts led by Vivek Arya said in a note. “However, in the 2H (second half), interest could shift to less-crowded auto/industrial chipmakers on inventory replenishment and pick-up in auto production assuming a global economic recovery.” BofA’s top picks include leaders in AI such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL). “In AI we continue to trust.. at least till 2H25,” analysts said. Furthermore, the firm identified Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) as a flash-memory tool leader poised for capital expenditure recovery and impact resolution in China. Auto and electric vehicle (EV) leader ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is highlighted for its potential cyclical recovery in the second half of 2025, and Cadence Design Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CDNS) is noted for its resilient double-digit growth, especially as the AI hardware cycle decelerates in the latter half of the year. The report also includes rating changes for smaller mid-cap stocks. Advanced Energy Industries (NASDAQ:AEIS) has been upgraded to Buy from Neutral, and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) has been raised to Neutral from Underperform due to expected growth acceleration. On the other hand, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) has been downgraded to Underperform from Neutral, with analysts citing a “lack of catalysts.” Moreover, BofA recognizes the potential in small to mid-cap stocks such as Coherent (NYSE:COHR), MACOM Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:MTSI), and Ceragon Networks (NASDAQ:CRNT), especially as growth extends to networking and optics sectors beyond just computing. “Despite the crowded nature of AI stocks, we still see a continued “arms-race” between cloud service providers, TAM expansion into enterprise on-premises and sovereign deployments, and continued pace of innovation in training and inference (agentic AI),” analysts continued. “However, AI stocks could potentially peak in 2H25E when investors start to get concerned about tougher YoY compares in 2026E following two years of 100%+ annual growth in AI silicon.”

BREAKING NEWS Marc Levy Associated Press Published: December 16, 2024 at 12:05 AM Updated: December 16, 2024 at 1:33 PM Marc Levy Associated Press Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved FILE - An advertisement of Bitcoin, one of the cryptocurrencies, is displayed on a building in Hong Kong, on Nov. 18, 2021. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File) HARRISBURG, Pa. – The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses that, together, could push states to become more open to crypto and for public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it. Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Recommended Videos Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to criticize government-backed currencies as prone to devaluation and say increased government buy-in will stabilize bitcoin's future price swings, give it more legitimacy and further boost an already rising price. But the risks are significant. Critics say a crypto investment is highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting its future returns, and warn that investors should be prepared to lose money. Only a couple public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency and a new U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued in recent days, warned it has “uniquely high volatility” and that it found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto. It has already been a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin hitting $100,000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts being cheered by Trump's promise to make the United States the “bitcoin superpower” of the world. More legislation on crypto could be coming Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills in 2025 to make them crypto-friendly as analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby, bitcoin miners build new installations and venture capitalists underwrite a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback. A bill introduced last month in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir. “I had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, ‘Oh my god, I’m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,” said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell. Cabell — a bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid — expects his bill to be reintroduced by a colleague. And leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect bills based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states next year. But what about public pension funds? Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn’t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto. Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek. “There might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,” Brainard said. “But it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.” In Louisiana, Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system by which people can pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies. Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather sees the step as a recognition that government must innovate and be flexible in helping people make financial transactions with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto. Fleming recalled meeting with a bitcoin lobbyist recently and came away unconvinced that bitcoin makes for a good investment. “My concern is that at some point it’ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,” Fleming said. “And when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.” In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation. Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said. Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin. That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York. Pension boards got investment tools they like this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and, in October, approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said. Many “are likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that’s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,” Palmer said. Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs. Some states already are investing in crypto In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it. Michigan's state investment board later reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto. Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund. “We were ahead of the curve," Fulop said. “And I think that’s what you’re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter.

POLAND - 2024/12/05: In this photo illustration, the BNY Mellon company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Custody banking giant BNY stock (NYSE: BK) has had a solid year, rising by 57% since early January, almost 2x the return of the S&P 500 over the same period, aided by a surge in asset prices globally. In comparison, BNY’s peer BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) is up 34% year-to-date. With the potential easing of regulations under President-Elect Trump, banks could benefit. See What’s The Outlook For U.S. Bancorp Stock? So what’s happening with BNY stock? While the stock has done well this year, it has seen considerable volatility over the last few years. Returns for the stock were 41% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 19% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BK face a similar situation as it did in 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? BNY, whose key businesses include custody, treasury services, markets, wealth, as well as investment management, outperformed the street estimates in the third quarter of 2024. Total revenue was up 5% year-over-year to $4.6 billion. The gains come as the company has expanded assets under custody and administration by 14% year-over-year to $52 trillion, followed by an 18% rise in Assets under Management to $2.1 trillion, led by higher asset valuations as well as inflows. This helps BNY given that it generates fees based on the amount of assets that clients keep with the bank. Overall, fee-based revenue rose about 5% compared to last year while net interest-related revenue grew by 3%, led by improved investment securities portfolio yields as well as balance sheet growth. Profits grew at an even quicker pace. Earnings per share stood at $1.50, up 22% year-over-year as non-interest-related expenses remained roughly flat compared to last year, as the company has been streamlining its operations to cut costs while focusing on higher-margin businesses. So what lies ahead for BNY stock? The markets have generally been bullish post the U.S. election, with Donald Trump set to assume the presidency for a second term. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to financial oversight compared to the Biden administration. This could help banks such as BNY in a couple of ways. For instance, lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Moreover, higher potential economic growth, coupled with lower interest rates, should bode well for asset prices, helping custody banks like BNY. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks. We have a $76 per share price estimate for BNY, which is roughly in line with the market price.

December 16, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from an important diamond drill hole at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. OB-24-337 is an exploratory hole drilled to a depth of 1,700 metres, the deepest hole ever drilled at the Project and the first hole drilled directly below the historic O’Brien Mine workings. At approximately 1,500 metres vertical depth it intersected sheared and mineralized rocks of the Piché Group, the dominant host rocks for O’Brien gold mineralization, and returned 242.0 g/t gold (“Au”) over 1.0 metre within a mineralized interval that averaged 31.24 g/t Au over 8.0 metres. Matt Manson, President and CEO, commented: “Following our “Jewellery Box” re-discovery news of December 9, 2024, we are taking the unusual step of releasing assays from another single drill hole today because of its particular significance to the future of the O’Brien Gold Project. Hole OB-24-337 was intended to be a pilot hole testing whether the Project’s host geology extended below the historic mine and to be a platform for future wedging and directional drilling. The fact that this hole intersected mineralization and visible gold at such a high grade greatly exceeded our expectations. Recall that approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. On September 24th we announced that drill hole OB-24-324 had intersected 27.61 g/t Au over 6.0 metres at 1,100 metres vertical depth. Now, we have new gold mineralization in a classic O’Brien setting at 1,500 metres vertical depth, a full 500 metres below the deepest workings of the old mine. It is clear that O’Brien gold mineralization is extensive at depth, implying significant future upside potential for the Project.” Figure 1: Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB-24-337 Figure 2: Long Section in Oblique View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with Drill Hole OB-337 and Other Recent Deep Drill Holes Illustrated. Table 1: Detailed Assay Results from Drill Hole OB-24-337 Notes on Calculation of Drill Intercepts:The O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts from drill hole OB-24-337 presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Intercepts presented in the deep drill hole compilation in Table 2 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 30-70% of core length.

Seven deep drill holes or drill hole wedges have been completed since this time. Six of the seven returned instances of visible gold and five of the seven returned drill intercepts well above the Project’s grade cutoff in the March 2023 MRE. The holes were drilled at northerly declinations with initial inclinations of between -65 and -85 degrees, followed by angling to provide a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be 30-70% of core length. Deep drill results since September 2024, summarized in Table 2, have now included: and now: The frequency and grade of intercepts returned by these deep drill holes, as well as the observed host geology, its deformation, the style of alteration, and the mineralogical association of the gold mineralization, are all familiar from the historical O’Brien mine and consistent with the modern geological model developed at shallower depths. The implication is that characteristic O’Brien style gold mineralization is extensive at depth, well below the level of the historic mine workings and the current MRE. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring in contact with the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac and footwall Cadillac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on drilling complete to the end of 2022, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.60 million tonnes at 8.66 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trend #s 0 to 5”). Table 3: Drill Hole Collar Information for Holes contained in this News Release QA/QC All drill cores in this campaign are NQ in size.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Purvi Agarwal (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose on Monday, as investors looked ahead to an anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cut later in the week as well as several key data releases for clues on monetary policy next year. The Fed's final rate decision of the year is due on Wednesday, with traders pricing in an over 99% chance of a 25 basis point rate reduction, as per CME's FedWatch. Most megacap and growth stocks traded higher, with Google-parent Alphabet up 3.8% and Amazon.com rising 1.3%, boosting communication services and consumer discretionary sectors about 1.5% each. Both the Nasdaq 100 and the Nasdaq Composite touched fresh record highs, while the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 0.8%. "The Nasdaq 100 has hit a fresh record high, and small-caps are in demand, as the final year-end chase gets underway, this is the 'Santa rally' almost right on cue," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG. Ahead of the Fed decision, investors awaited Tuesday's retail sales data and other key releases scheduled throughout the week. With a rate cut all but priced in, investors' primary focus will be on policymakers' outlook for next year as bets moderate on the pace of rate cuts amid strong economic growth and persistent inflation. "The S&P's year-to-date 26.86% gain far exceeds the average 10.05% annual gain since 1995 ... this jampacked week of important economic figures along with the FOMC meeting could be the game changer," said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial. Stocks have overall had a bumper run in 2024 as gains in artificial intelligence-related companies, the start of the Fed's rate cutting cycle and expected pro-business policies from Donald Trump's incoming administration have lifted equities. S&P Global's December flash PMI showed manufacturing activity stood at 48.3, while services activity was at 58.5, above estimates of 55.7. At 12:13 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.04 points, or 0.01%, to 43,823.02, the S&P 500 gained 24.04 points, or 0.40%, to 6,075.13 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 181.44 points, or 0.91%, to 20,108.16. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury briefly eased from an over three-week high before creeping back above 4.4%. Honeywell International gained 3.3% after the industrial conglomerate said it was exploring a separation of its aerospace business. Tesla leapt 5.4% after Wedbush Securities raised its price target on the stock to a Wall Street high of $515. Crypotocurrency stocks rose as bitcoin jumped above $106,000 after Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, and bitcoin buyer MicroStrategy was set to join the Nasdaq 100 index. MicroStrategy jumped 5%, while bitcoin miner MARA Holdings gained 8.8%. Super Micro Computer, among those set to be removed from the Nasdaq 100, dropped 6.9%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.34-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 141 new lows.

Title: Why Intel's Foundry May Be Set For A Comeback
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/16/why-intels-foundry-may-be-set-for-a-comeback/

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 14: The Intel logo is seen outside a pop-up store on Oxford Street ... [+] on November 14, 2024 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Intel stock has declined by over 55% this year and trades at just about $21 per share. While part of the sell-off has come due to Intel’s market share losses in the CPU space and the broader industry pivot toward AI-focused GPU chips for data centers, the bigger issue for Intel has been its foundry business. Intel has invested about $25 billion into the business in each of the last two years and results have been hard to come by. The foundry reported a $7 billion operating loss on $18.9 billion in revenue. That being said, a turnaround is well within sight, in our view. Intel’s next-gen 18A fabrication process technology is almost ready to roll out, and the company also appears to be a key beneficiary of regulatory support under the Trump administration given its strategic importance to U.S. technological independence. See why you should consider selling Nvidia and buying Intel stock. The Latest 18A Process Node Intel is betting big on its 18A process, which it considers its most advanced yet, to turn around its foundry business. The process produces chips with technologies including RibbonFET gate-all-around transistors and PowerVia backside power delivery, which are expected to boost performance and power efficiency. The chips using this process will be based on a 1.8-nanometer node size, putting Intel slightly ahead of TSMC’s N2 process which operates at a 2 nm node and is expected to arrive in the second half of 2025. While TSMC claims that its N2 process will outperform Intel’s 18A in some crucial areas, such as SRAM density (enabling it to store more data in a smaller physical area), Intel’s 18A’s backside power delivery gives it a competitive edge​ with reduced power loss and better thermal performance. Good news on the new chip’s progress, or bad news if delays occur, could increase volatility in the stock. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Intel announced in early August that it had reached critical milestones with chips made using the 18A process, noting that the chip had powered on, booted operating systems, and was operational within Intel. The company expects external customers to tape out (move from design to foundry for manufacturing) their first 18A designs in 2025, with large-scale production to begin thereafter. Intel has secured big contracts with this technology, including with the U.S. Department of Defense for the RAMP-C program, which seeks to bring leading-edge semiconductor technology domestically. Other high-profile customers include Amazon and Microsoft, which intend to design custom chips, including AI accelerators. Also see, Do Custom AI Chips Make Marvell Stock A Buy? Although there have been rumors suggesting that chipmaker Broadcom, which has been testing out Intel’s 18A process, was disappointed with the yields of the new process, this was refuted by Intel’s ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger. Intel says that its process shows defect density figures of 0.4 defects per square centimeter for now, which is only slightly worse than TSMC’s benchmarks of 0.33 defects on its legacy N7 and N5 nodes at comparable stages of development - roughly a year before entering high volume production. Given that the standard for this stage of development is typically below 0.5 defects per square centimeter, it means that Intel could be well within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be adequate for generating usable yields. Intel Foundry’s Rising Geopolitical RolePresident-elect Donald Trump’s emphasis on boosting U.S. manufacturing could work in Intel’s favor, given its sizable domestic fabrication footprint. There’s a possibility that Intel could see considerable regulatory support aimed at boosting domestic chip production. For example, the new administration could look at imposing tariffs that make it more expensive for foreign fabrication companies to produce and export chips to the U.S. A stronger emphasis on domestic production, either through tariffs or via other policies, could drive more business to Intel. Intel’s foundry division - which produces chips for third-party customers - could also see stronger demand, particularly as companies look to rely on U.S. suppliers to avoid potential duties. Semiconductors are also critical for national security - an area that Trump has consistently emphasized - and Intel’s domestic manufacturing footprint is likely to be crucial as it helps to secure U.S. technological independence. Intel could also see a higher number of contracts awarded to it from the government, being the only American semiconductor player that both designs and fabricates leading-edge logic chips in the U.S. Intel won a $3 billion government contract to expand chip production for the U.S. military a few months ago, and there’s a possibility that this could scale up further under Trump, who boosted military spending over his last term. Intel’s huge fab capacity and its newest process nodes could help domestic semiconductor designs better secure their supply chains as well. Take Nvidia for example. The GPU titan relies almost exclusively on Taiwan’s TSMC to produce its cutting-edge AI chips. TSMC is based in Taiwan, making production vulnerable to geopolitical tensions with China. Intel, with its U.S.-based manufacturing, would mitigate that risk to a large extent. The decrease in INTC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could INTC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? Foundry Assets Provide A Backstop To Intel’s Valuation The semiconductor foundry business is risky given that management must make massive capital investment decisions based on predictions about future technologies several years before the demand for those technologies materializes. While Intel has seen major missteps with its current investment cycle, there’s probably a pretty limited downside for the stock at the moment. Intel’s stock currently trades at less than 1x its book value - essentially the net value of its assets after subtracting liabilities. This means the market is pricing Intel at just the value of its tangible assets while completely discounting its technological know-how in chip manufacturing and design, its increasing importance to national security, and its future potential. This creates an opportunity for investors who see potential beyond the company’s sizable balance sheet. Intel stock also trades at just about 21x its estimated 2025 earnings, which are depressed by its heavy foundry spending and recent market share losses. Earnings are projected at about $1 per share next year, down from close to $2 in 2022 and about $5 in 2021. As demand picks up, we could see a reversal in both earnings as well as Intel’s valuation multiple. Intel’s new co-CEOs say that the company’s Intel’s foundry business is in the process of being shifted to be a subsidiary, indicating that it could operate independently from the chip-design segment. The executives also indicated that the possibility of separating the foundry business from the rest of the company was an option in the future. This could also help to eventually unlock some value. We value Intel stock at about $27 per share, 30% ahead of the current market price. See our analysis of Intel’s valuation : Expensive or Cheap?

Title: Many CEOs don’t want bodyguards even after Brian Thompson murder — here’s what they’re doing instead

As corporations and their boards scramble to protect the C-suite after the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson — scrubbing company Web sites of bios and photos — they’re facing one big issue. Many executives don’t want to deal with the massive lifestyle change that can come with having a bodyguard. “Unless they’re ex-Mossad they probably aren’t going to be that helpful,” one high-level executive who has eschewed security, told NYNext. “I don’t want to walk around with bodyguards.” This person explained he’s been around enough people who have guards to see how it can interfere with your life — the annoyance of someone invading personal moments and never feeling truly alone. If anything, he believes, “It makes you more conspicuous.” Indeed, said Yale School of Management’s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, “Most CEOs don’t want security.” Sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they are more willing to increase safety measures by taking safety into their own hands. That ranges from applying for a concealed carry permit to buying a pepper spray “pistol” (the Byrna gun, which advertises itself as being the “less lethal weapon”) to, in one case, even donning a bullet proof vest. Another source, who admits he’s been worried about disgruntled shareholders targeting him, said that since Thompson’s shooting he tries to be more aware of his surroundings when walking around. But he would rather be able to protect himself than outsource his safety. “It’s too affected,” he explains. But for boards — who could be on the hook for shareholder lawsuits if they’re not adequately protecting executives — security is a priority. “It’s not the first agenda item … but it’s pretty high up,” Sonnenfeld said. “There is panic from corporate America. If something happens to a public company CEO, it will affect the stock price,” said Mac Segal, whose AHNA Group provides security for wealthy individuals and corporations. “There has been a 30% uptick in interest and requests [for security] over the last week.” Meta, which spent nearly $25 million last year on executive security — dramatically more than almost any other major corporation — is setting the tone for what board members feel obligated to do, another security expert explained. “Without a doubt, that number is already going up — that is on every large company’s mind now,” said Kevin Hartz, the former Eventbrite CEO who recently launched Sauron, a high-end at-home security monitoring company. While bodyguards are the most obvious sign of protection, security experts are quick to note there are other, less obtrusive ways to keep executives safe. “It’s not about guys in dark suits and glasses,” Segal said, nothing that in some fields, those “can often be a status symbol.” Instead, it is about “monitoring risk” — paying attention to threats on social media, possibly sending an advance team to scope out a location before an exec arrives, or protecting the entrance and exit to company events, the office and even the person’s home. “You can opt for a lower-profile approach,” he added, noting he always provides clients a range of options. “Security is like medicine: Security firms shouldn’t be prescribing something [like bodyguards] if they don’t know what’s right for the company.” One group who is pro-bodyguard? The so-called “cryptonaires” who fear being targeted because their digital wealth can be accessed with just a password and transferred online to an anonymous user. Tadas Kasputis, founder of crypto exchange ExMarkets, told CryptoNews he got bodyguards after being kidnapped in his hometown in Lithuania in 2015. “They came out of nowhere,” he recalled, “pushed me into a van and drove around town trying to get me to tell them my bitcoin wallet passwords.” This story is part of NYNext, a new editorial series that highlights New York City innovation across industries, as well as the personalities leading the way.

Title: New Investment Scam Leverages AI, Social Media Ads to Target Victims Worldwide

Time Published: 2024-12-16T10:17:00Z

Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new kind of investment scam that leverages a combination of social media malvertising, company-branded posts, and artificial intelligence (AI) powered video testimonials featuring famous personalities, ultimately leading to financial and data loss. "The main goal of the fraudsters is to lead victims to phishing websites and forms that harvest their personal information," ESET noted in its H2 2024 Threat Report shared with The Hacker News. The Slovak cybersecurity company is tracking the threat under the name Nomani, a play on the phrase "no money." It said the scam grew by over 335% between H1 and H2 2024, with more than 100 new URLs detected daily on average between May and November 2024. The attacks play out through fraudulent ads on social media platforms, in several cases targeting people who have previously been scammed by making use of Europol- and INTERPOL-related lures about contacting them for help or getting their stolen money refunded by clicking on a link. These ads are published from a mix of fake and stolen legitimate profiles associated with small businesses, governmental entities, and micro-influencers with tens of thousands of followers. Other distribution channels include sharing these posts on Messenger and Threads, as well as sharing deceptively positive reviews on Google. "Another large group of accounts frequently spreading Nomani ads are newly created profiles with easy-to-forget names, a handful of followers, and very few posts," ESET pointed out. The websites these links direct to have been found to request for their contact information and visually imitate local news media; abuse logos and branding of specific organizations; or claim to advertise cryptocurrency management solutions with ever-changing names such as Quantum Bumex, Immediate Mator, or Bitcoin Trader. In the next step, cybercriminals use the data gathered from the phishing domains to directly call the victims and manipulate them into investing their money into non-existent investment products that falsely show phenomenal gains. In some cases, victims are duped into taking out loans or installing remote access apps on their devices. "When these victim 'investors' request payout of the promised profits, the scammers force them to pay additional fees and to provide further personal information such as ID and credit card information," ESET said. "In the end, the fraudsters take both the money and data and disappear – following the typical pig butchering scam." There is evidence to suggest that Nomani is the work of Russian-speaking threat actors given the presence of source code comments in Cyrillic and the use of Yandex tools for visitor tracking. Similar to major scam operations like Telekopye, it's suspected that there are different groups who are in charge of managing each and every aspect of the attack chain: Theft, creation, and abuse of Meta accounts and ads, building the phishing infrastructure, and running the call centers. "By using social engineering techniques and building trust with the victims, scammers often outmaneuver even the authorization mechanisms and verification phone calls the banks use to prevent fraud," ESET said. The development comes as South Korean law enforcement authorities said they took down a large-scale fraud network that defrauded nearly $6.3 million from victims with fake online trading platforms as part of an operation called MIDAS. More than 20 servers utilized by the fraud ring have been seized and 32 people involved in the scheme have been arrested. Besides luring victims with SMS and phone calls, users of the illicit home trading system (HTS) programs were enticed into investing their funds by watching YouTube videos and joining KakaoTalk chat rooms. "The program communicates with the servers of real brokerage firms to get real-time stock price information, and uses publicly available chart libraries to create visual representations," the Financial Security Institute (K-FSI) said in a presentation given at the Black Hat Europe conference last week. "However, no actual stock trades are made. Rather, the program's core feature, a screen capture function, is used to spy on users' screens, collect unauthorized information, and refuse to return money."

Title: Webscale Network Operators Exhibit Robust Growth and Investment in Q3 2024

December 16, 2024 05:14 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Network Operators: 3Q24 Market Review" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (WNO, or webscale) market since 2011. It covers 21 companies. In the most recent 12 months (4Q23-3Q24), webscalers represented $2.53 trillion (T) in revenues (+9.1% YoY), $307 billion (B) in R&D spending (+6.5% YoY), and $254B in capex (+32.5% YoY). They had $631B of cash and short-term investments (-11.3% YoY) on the books as of September 2024, and $538B in total debt (-4.1% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of September 2024 was $854B, up 25.9% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.226 million (M) people at the end of 3Q24, up 2.3% from the Sept. 2023 total of 4.130M. Key Report Highlights: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 3Q24 were $638.6 billion (B), up 10.6% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.527 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For five straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth, well above the rest of the pack. For the 3Q24 annualized period, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 23.1% versus 4Q22-3Q23, followed by Microsoft (+16.4%), Alphabet (14.4%), and Amazon (11.9%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 3Q24 came from Amazon, as its single quarter revenues grew $15.8 billion from 3Q23 to end 3Q24 at $158.9B, up 11.0% YoY. The only curb on growth in 3Q24 was Japanese IT services & cloud vendor Fujitsu, which recorded 3Q24 revenues of $5.8B, down $492 million (M) YoY (-7.8%). Capex: After declining 5% in 2023, webscale capex has grown at incredibly fast, unsustainable rates in 2024: up by 25%, 51%, and 58% YoY in the first three quarters of the year. 3Q24 capex of $75.6B pushed the annualized total to $253.9B, up 32.5% YoY, and another all-time high. Investor interest in generative AI has spread rapidly, driving GPU spend in the data center. The current investment spike would seem to be inspired by a mix of hype and fear of missing out, as GenAI brings with it a plethora of legal & regulatory risks and relative lack of proven business models. Most recent webscale capex is focused on outfitting existing data centers: from 46% of annualized capex in 3Q22, Network/IT and software capex was 53% of total capex for the latest annualized period. The biggest capex outlays in 3Q24 came from Amazon ($22.6B), Microsoft ($14.9B), Alphabet ($13.1B), and Meta (FB) ($8.3B). These four account for about 80% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the unsustainable surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 17.6% for the 3Q24 annualized period, a bit lower than a year prior (17.9%) but higher than the 14.1% booked in 3Q22. Average net profit margin for 4Q23-3Q24 was 18.9%, a bit higher than 16.9% in 3Q23. Both profitability metrics are around the same level as in the year before COVID. Meta, Tencent and Microsoft are regularly near or at the top of the heap on both metrics, and this was again the case in 3Q24. The ecommerce specialists Amazon and Alibaba are the laggards, as usual. The biggest drops in free cash flow margins came at the companies with surging capex: Alphabet and Amazon. The biggest decline in net profitability was Apple, which was fined 13 billion Euros in September 2024 for taking illegal profits from a tax scheme in Ireland over two decades. This tax scheme has been widely known about and criticized for many years. While 13 billion sounds like a lot, it hardly impacted Apple's market trajectory at all. Apple's stock price is around 14% higher now than on 1 July 2024. Consumers and taxpayers are losing out, while big tech uses political friends to secure victories. This will get worse with new political leadership in the US. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.23 million in September 2024, slightly up from 4.13 million in September 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Amazon's workforce grew by 51,000 between September 2023 and 2024, for instance. Total webscale headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million or so steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Per our latest forecast, we expect webscale employment to rise slightly in 2025 but decline thereafter due to greater use of robotics, automation and AI. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters, and that continued in 3Q24. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 3Q24 revenue growth was 5% YoY, in line with the last few quarters of low single digit percentage growth. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. Another factor is TikTok. This company, owned by ByteDance, has grown at explosive rates for the last few years, but remains private. We have no reasonable way to include TikTok figures in our database. The ByteDance surge also ate into the 2022-23 growth of some western webscalers, notably Meta (FB), but that effect has ebbed.

Title: What's ahead for the markets in 2025, according to experts

U.S. stocks rose in 2024, fueled by the unprecedented surge of artificial intelligence — a revolutionary technology that has driven investor sentiment. Inflation also eased after a couple of years of persistent price pressure, allowing the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates. The results of the presidential election provided an additional boost, propelling the Dow and other major stock indexes to record highs and setting the stage for 2025. As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, certain sectors and stocks are expected to see significant shifts. Here’s what analysts and experts expect. The S&P 500 was hovering above 6,000 in mid-December. Major banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have forecast that the benchmark index will reach 6,500 in 2025. The optimism is supported by confidence in ongoing earnings growth and a favorable monetary policy environment, key drivers of market performance. Eric Schiffer, chairman of the Los Angeles-based investment firm The Patriarch Organization, told Quartz in an email that he expects the S&P to reach 6,750 by the end of next year, with the Dow at 49,500 and Nasdaq at 22,100. (The Dow was at about 44,000 in mid-December, and the Nasdaq at about 20,000.) Jeff Krumpelman of Mariner Wealth Advisors has a similar forecast, expecting the S&P 500 to reach 6,600 by the end of 2025. In a more optimistic scenario, he anticipates the index could climb as high as 7,000. Paula Murphy, a senior vice president and director of portfolio management at the bank Rockland Trust, said financial firms stand to gain the most from the reduced regulation, corporate tax cuts, and lower capital requirements expected under Trump. That could drive an acceleration of loan growth and an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity for banks. Murphy said energy companies may also see new gains under the new administration. “Energy companies may also benefit from potential deregulation, as well as policy shifts to further boost domestic oil and natural gas production,” Murphy said in an email. She noted that potential sanctions on oil-exporting countries could tighten global supply, leading to higher prices. As China continues to be the world’s leading exporter of goods and the United States its largest importer — bringing in approximately $427 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2023 — these dynamics may have significant implications, Murphy said. “Inflationary pressures stemming from tougher trade with China may lead to volatility in sectors dependent on global supply chains,” she said. And restrictive immigration policies under Trump may reduce U.S. labor supply, Murphy said, resulting in higher wages. Those increased labor costs could shrink profit margins, especially in labor-intensive sectors such as agriculture, hospitality, and manufacturing. AI stocks have been some of the strongest in the market this year, with companies including AI chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) driving indexes to new heights. Next year is expected to usher in another phase of AI development, which could lead to greater efficiency and cost savings for businesses. Murphy said there will also be “increased awareness and scrutiny of the importance of developing and deploying AI in a way that is ethical, secure, transparent, reliable, and respectful of intellectual property rights.” Trump’s election win drove down renewable energy stocks, largely due to his hostile stance on climate policy. Murphy acknowledged that Trump’s victory could transform U.S. energy policy by prioritizing fossil fuels and opposing climate initiatives. But she said this doesn’t mean the renewable energy sector will stop growing. “Data center and AI rollout has increased demand for renewables by a significant amount this year, and we expect this to continue,” she said. “These data centers require massive power expenditures, and the companies building out these data centers frequently have self-imposed clean energy mandates.” It also remains to be seen how Trump’s close relationship with billionaire Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will influence U.S. policy toward electric vehicles.

Title: What's ahead for tech in 2025, according to an IBM executive

Since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT two years ago, the tech industry has been consumed by generative artificial intelligence — and the next year will see more businesses adopt the technology, one tech executive predicts. Enterprises are already looking for technology to scale and implement AI, and the focus in 2025 will be on more efficiency and less risk, Hillery Hunter, chief technology officer and general manager of innovation at IBM (IBM) Infrastructure, told Quartz. With cost efficiency in mind, enterprises will likely look for smaller, more targeted generative AI models, Hunter said. Businesses could also turn to ensembles — or combining multiple machine learning or deep learning models for more accurate and robust results — that will allow them “to optimize latency, efficiency and accuracy across their AI workloads,” Hunter said. “For example,” Hunter said, “enterprises would have the option to use smaller, faster and more energy-efficient models on a CPU [core processing unit] as a starting point for data analysis and processing and then use larger models on a GPU [graphics processing unit], as needed, for more complex workloads that require extra performance, all within the same AI Workflow.” In July, Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang said the next wave of AI is for businesses, and that everyone at a company “will have an AI assistant.” “We hope that we can give every single organization the ability to create their own AIs,” Huang said during a fireside chat at SIGGRAPH, a computer graphics conference. “So everybody would be augmented and have a collaborative AI that could empower them, help them do better work.” As the tech industry focuses on launching new AI products, it’s now AI agents, or software that can complete complex tasks autonomously, that have taken over the chatbot hype. Most AI-powered tools that have launched so far are co-pilots that can help users work more efficiently, but have to be prompted over and over. In the next year, companies will risk being left behind if they don’t step up their AI efforts, Hunter said. While businesses saw AI become more important this year, they “often struggled with disjointed AI process steps and driving true ROI [return on investment].” Businesses have to bring AI projects together in 2025, Hunter said, or otherwise create “an increasingly bloated tech environment” with more costs and slower innovation. “It’s time for enterprises to kill the Frankencloud — a disjointed environment where data is duplicated and sprawled out across various, disconnected locations — and create the holistic view they need to actually leverage and govern the data and models associated with AI, and generate outcomes that support their AI investment,” Hunter said. Next year will also see enterprises commit to getting out of “tech debt” — debt from failing to modernize IT infrastructure or not having unified IT or cloud-based solutions that are needed to optimize AI. “AI itself will help modernize IT, but in the year ahead, collaboration across the C-suite is going to be key to getting out of this debt,” Hunter said.

Title: CMA launches probe into BlackRock’s £2.55bn acquisition of Preqin

Time Published: 2024-12-16T09:55:02Z
Full Content:
The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced an investigation into BlackRock’s £2.55bn acquisition of UK-based private markets data provider Preqin. The British competition watchdog is assessing whether the deal, announced in June 2024, could potentially lead to a significant lessening of competition within the UK market. On 3 December 2024, the CMA issued an invitation for public comments seeking input on how the transaction might impact competition in the country. This marks the initial stage of the regulator’s review process under the Enterprise Act 2002. Stakeholders have until 17 December 2024 to submit their views. The CMA officially commenced its initial assessment phase on 16 December 2024. By 12 February 2025, the regulator is expected to announce whether the transaction will progress to a more detailed Phase 2 investigation. The inquiry is part of the CMA’s broader mandate to ensure mergers and acquisitions do not harm competition, restrict consumer choice, or create monopolies within UK markets. The acquisition will see global asset management giant BlackRock integrating Preqin’s extensive private markets data and research capabilities into its technology platform, Aladdin. Preqin, an independent data provider, delivers insights to over 200,000 users worldwide, including asset managers, insurers, pension funds, and banks. The UK-based firm’s data spans 190,000 funds, 60,000 fund managers, and 30,000 investors in the private markets sector. The company, which is projected to generate £240m in recurring revenue in 2024, has experienced an annual growth rate of approximately 20% over the past three years. BlackRock’s aim is to leverage Preqin’s offerings to strengthen its position in the fast-growing private markets data segment, a key area for investors seeking alternatives to traditional public markets. In addition, the integration of Preqin with eFront, Aladdin’s private markets platform, is expected to unite data, research, and investment workflows to support fund managers and investors across fundraising, deal sourcing, portfolio management, accounting, and performance analysis. The BlackRock-Preqin deal is the latest in a series of high-profile cases reviewed by the CMA. In November, the CMA assessed Google’s partnership with AI start-up Anthropic, determining that it did not warrant further investigation. This followed its abandonment of similar merger investigations into deals struck by Microsoft with AI startups Mistral and Inflection. Earlier this month, the regulator also approved the merger of telecom giants Vodafone and Three, subject to stringent conditions designed to protect consumer interests.

Title: The hefty bill for the banks, the MPs’ initiatives, and the whining about the Metro, the disgrace of the TV-lawyer, and the billionaire’s financial strains

Greetings, well, it’s well-known that when K.M. takes charge of something, he doesn’t make mistakes or do sloppy work. That’s what happened yesterday during the budget discussion, where the measures he announced for the banks outshone any proposals from the opposition. But he also gave a social touch by imposing a “mandatory donation” of 100 million euros from the banks to support school infrastructure. So, Kyriakos Mitsotakis took things a step further and caught the bankers off guard with yesterday’s announcements. On fees for basic transactions (bill payments, dealings with the public sector, etc.), we’re looking at a complete elimination—not mere reductions, as initially expected. This is estimated to cost banks about 120 million euros annually, alongside the ENFIA (property tax) adjustment, as the Prime Minister mentioned legislative provisions to make this permanent. Add 100 million euros for the body that will manage properties of vulnerable borrowers and another 100 million for funding the renovation and construction of new schools, and the ENFIA adjustment. Altogether, the bill handed to the banks yesterday amounts to approximately 320 million euros. K.M.’s announcements, such as covering pharmaceutical expenses for low-income pensioners and granting a hazard allowance for uniformed personnel, were initially proposals from New Democracy MPs. Back then, they were labeled as “rebellious” initiatives, but the Maximos Mansion didn’t “criminalize” the suggestions. Instead, it processed them and is now implementing them. This way, the government showcases tangible actions, and the MPs can boast to their constituents that they influenced governmental decisions. The other day, there was a technical failure on a Thessaloniki Metro train. Passengers were inconvenienced, having to walk along the tunnel’s emergency corridor, which is specifically designed for such situations. The whole power outage lasted about 90 minutes, but the actual inconvenience for passengers was much shorter. Nobody truly claimed there was any risk to people because the power cut affected a Metro train. Yet, in Parliament, PASOK, SYRIZA, and the New Left (especially Haritsis, who pretends to be “modern”) raised a huge fuss. Honestly, I don’t think there’s another country in Europe where the opposition collectively blows up over a power cut in a single train on a completely new Metro system (and therefore bound to have some technical glitches). We’re talking about sheer ridiculousness! Six months ago, on a Sunday afternoon in early summer, the public was bombarded with reports about the arrest of a well-known TV lawyer who had almost beaten his wife and mother of his children to death. Initially, there were absurd excuses he gave during the investigation—claims that she “fell down the stairs”—but soon, under pressure from the police and investigators, she revealed the horrific truth. There was explosive media coverage for a few days. The coroner’s report revealed brutal beatings (17 punches to a woman’s face!). There were also dubious claims of psychiatric issues, and eventually, the whole thing faded out of the spotlight. Fast forward six months—before the year even ends—and this monster of a lawyer is appearing on TV shows as an angel. Look, here’s his new home, his new partner, and praise for his severely beaten ex-wife as a good mother, and so on. And life goes on. Now, you tell me: with a government that boasts laws against domestic violence and a justice system like ours, can anyone believe that things are improving in this country? Rot and corruption, or just the overwhelming sense that, in the end, everything here gets swept under the rug and left “half-resolved”? We still don’t have any progress on the issue of abolishing the Public Sector’s special rights in its 8.4% stake in the National Bank of Greece. The delay didn’t come from the Finance Ministry or the HFSF (Hellenic Financial Stability Fund). From the Greek side, all procedures are complete, and the delay stems from discussions between the ESM and SSM. The SSM doesn’t oppose abolishing the special rights, but the ESM wants to handle the matter in a way that fully safeguards their interests. So, it’s just a matter of time. Financial constraints—let’s put it politely—are plaguing the billionaire (?) Beny Steinmetz, also known as the “diamond king.” Word in the market is that he sold one of his two mines in Guinea (the operational one), as well as the nickel plant he owned in Skopje. Regarding the refinery in Italy, which even got the attention of the Financial Times, it was eventually bought by shipping magnate G. Economou because Steinmetz couldn’t come up with 140 million euros at the time. I’m telling you this to keep you informed since Greece doesn’t have many billionaires, and Steinmetz is one of them. Aside from being the diamond king, he’s also the king of arrests at airports (Israel, Cyprus, etc.), thanks to warrants against him. So, he’s spending his time in our country—not that he’s suffering, as he splits his days between a residence in Vouliagmeni (owned by a well-known Greek businessman) and his yacht. The regional airports packaged together Ultimately, the 22 regional airports will be granted as a single “package” to one operator. These airports will be released from the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) for concession via an international tender in the first half of 2025. Advisors for the tender have already conducted on-site inspections of the airport cluster (Karpathos, Chios, Alexandroupolis, Araxos, Limnos, Ioannina, Milos, Naxos, Paros, Ikaria, Kythira, Leros, Sitia, Nea Anchialos, Kalymnos, Skyros, Syros, Astypalaia, Kastellorizo, Kastoria, Kasos, and Kozani) to assess their current condition and identify needs to structure the tender framework. There is also consideration for some of these airports to be utilized for cargo transport or charter flights. Additionally, there is an intention for HCAP to retain a stake in the airports, similar to the Kalamata airport case. However, some issues remain unresolved, such as matters involving the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), though HCAP estimates that the concession process will be completed by the end of 2027. The €765 million PPP for the prisons In April, bids are expected to be invited from interested companies for the major €765 million Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project involving the relocation of Korydallos prison to Aspropyrgos. A prerequisite is the approval of the environmental terms. A positive development is the recent approval of a special urban planning framework. The project, managed by the Recovery Fund’s Maturity Unit on behalf of the Ministry of Citizen Protection, involves partnering with a private entity for the design, construction, and maintenance of the facility for up to 30 years. Interest has been expressed by companies such as GEK Terna, Mytilineos, Aktor Concessions, and Avax, with the competitive dialogue nearing completion. The prisons will be relocated to a 100-acre property at the site of the former “American Convenience” military base in Aspropyrgos. The new premises and infrastructure for the modern Judicial Correctional Institution of Athens (JCIA) and the Attica Court Transfer Directorate (ACTD) will be located on the site of the old NATO base. End of an era Last year, Allianz stated that Christos Georgakopoulos, the founder of European Reliance, would remain a member of the board and an administrative advisor. However, his departure from the board of European Reliance-Allianz has quietly marked the end of his tenure. Tensions had arisen anyway, stemming from cultural differences between the German insurance giant and the Greek company. ADMIE board’s term extended Before the stock market opens today, ADMIE (the Independent Power Transmission Operator) will close the cycle of announcements for its nine-month results. Although the third-quarter financials are being released in mid-December, significantly late, they maintain expectations for a distribution of the remaining €14.5 million in dividends in September, along with the pre-dividend of €13.5 million. However, the key highlight is that by this time next year, the electrical connection between Attica and Crete will have been completed, generating an additional €770 million in annual revenue for ADMIE. Following the publication of the nine-month financial statements, a letter will be sent to shareholders regarding the renewal of the current administration’s term, resolving the final pending matter of the year. ECB halts bond purchases starting today Starting today, the European Central Bank (ECB) will permanently cease repurchasing bonds issued under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP). This marks the ECB’s withdrawal from the European bond market as the largest buyer of eurozone countries’ debt. The ECB launched PEPP in March 2020 following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching a peak portfolio of €1.72 trillion two years later. Bond reinvestments were scaled back in July and officially end today, as the ECB wraps up for the holiday season. From now on, each issuer of debt—i.e., each individual country—will have to manage market fears and expectations, which will dictate the pricing of their bonds. The biggest challenge will likely be faced by France, where 52% of its public debt is managed by foreign investors and funds. France’s public debt already stands at 118% of GDP, and Paris will be seeking more than €300 billion (!) in 2025. Greece, on the other hand, appears to have managed its situation, with the €8 billion it needs to borrow next year not expected to pose a problem. The Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) has planned only two new short-term bond issues and 10 re-issues on agreed dates. Industrial parks The prepayment (40% of the subsidy) from the Recovery Fund has been disbursed to ETBA Industrial Parks S.A. for the business plan aimed at developing industrial parks. elvoX automotive | mobility | technology is a Greek startup that designs and develops electric commercial vehicles—vans. Based in Acharnes, the elvoX team is striving to bring electric innovation to the commercial vehicle market. Reports suggest that this Greek startup has already attracted the interest of angel investors, mainly from the Middle East, for the development of its pioneering electric vehicles designed to meet the needs of urban and suburban professional transport, with the potential for future autonomous operation. Foreign investors are using Greece as a pilot “entry point” for research and development, prototype completion, and—if all goes well—the initiation of electric van production in Greece for the European market. Last Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 86 points (-0.2%), marking its 7th consecutive session of losses. This is the longest losing streak for the blue-chip index in nearly five years. This is happening during a period of general stock market euphoria on the other side of the Atlantic, where 46% of investors predict further price increases. However, at the same time, there have been record stock sales by major shareholders of Wall Street’s “champions.” For example, Jeff Bezos of Amazon sold $1.25 billion worth of his company’s shares in November. In total, in 2024, Amazon’s founder and his close associates sold $12.5 billion worth of shares. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg liquidated another block of Meta shares worth $153 million. In 2024 alone, Zuckerberg sold shares of the company he founded worth approximately $2.4 billion. Meta is now valued at over $1.5 trillion for the first time in history, and the S&P 500 index appears poised to end the year with annual gains of around 24% or more. Meanwhile, top executives at NVIDIA have also announced stock sales worth $1.85 billion this year. A total of about 11 million NVIDIA shares have been sold since the start of the year, the most of any single company. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO, revealed he sold 6 million shares. The question remains: who knows better? Those selling shares of the companies they lead, or those buying them? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the FED will conclude its two-day meeting this coming Wednesday. Markets have already priced in a quarter-point reduction in the federal funds rate. Things will get more interesting next year, with less consensus on how the FED should address persistent inflation amidst concerns about economic growth. But that’s a problem for next year. For now, investors have the holiday season to look forward to. The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan will announce their monetary policy decisions on Thursday. However, Jerome Powell’s problem is much more complex. Currently, the average interest rate on U.S. government debt is 3.4%, the highest since 2008. The U.S. government is paying heavily for its borrowing. Over the last two years, U.S. debt interest rates have more than doubled. About $6.4 trillion of U.S. debt is in treasury bills with an average interest rate of 4.7%, while $14.4 trillion is in government bonds with an average interest rate of 2.8%. In reality, the total net interest cost reached an annualized record pace of $1.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2024. The U.S. government is spending $3 billion EVERY DAY just on interest payments. This may very well be the only reason Powell feels compelled to reduce dollar interest rates… Explore related questions

Surging volumes in put options linked to BlackRock's Nasdaq-listed spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) could be interpreted as bearish sentiment. That's not necessarily the case. On Friday, more than 13,000 contracts of the $30 out-of-the-money (OTM) put option expiring May 16 changed hands as the ETF rose 1.7% to $57.91, according to data from Amberdata. Volume in the $35 put option expiring Jan. 16, 2026, topped 10,000 contracts. Most of the activity probably stems from market participants looking to generate passive income through "cash-secured put selling" rather than outright purchase of the options as bearish bets, according to Greg Magadini, Amberdata's director of derivatives. A put seller, offering insurance against price drops in return for a premium, is obligated to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific expiration date. (That's opposed to the buyer of the put, who has the right but not the obligation to sell the asset.) That means savvy traders often write OTM puts to acquire the underlying asset at a lower price while pocketing the premium received by selling the put option. They do so by continuously maintaining the cash required to purchase the asset if the owner of the put option exercises their right to sell the asset. Hence, the strategy is called "cash-secured" selling of puts. In IBIT's case, sellers of the $35 put expiring in January 2026 will keep the premium if IBIT stays above that level until expiry. If IBIT drops below $35, the put sellers must buy the ETF at that price while keeping the premium received. The sellers of the $30 put expiring in May next year face a similar payoff scenario. "The $35 Puts for Jan 2026 traded +10k contract with an IV range of 73.52% to 69.94%, VWAP at 70.75% suggests net selling from the street… potentially Cash Secured put selling flows (for traders who missed the rally)," Magadini said in a note shared with CoinDesk. Saxo Bank's analyst suggested cash-secured put selling as the preferred strategy in Nvidia early this year. Overall, IBIT call options, which offer an asymmetric upside to buyers, continue to trade pricer than puts. As of Friday, call-put skews, with maturities ranging from five to 126 days, were positive, signaling relative richness of implied volatility for calls. The bullish sentiment is consistent with the pricing in options tied to bitcoin and trading on Deribit. On Friday, IBIT recorded a net inflow of $393 million, representing the majority of the total inflow of $428.9 million across the 11 spot ETFs listed in the U.S, according to data tracked by Farside Investors.

Title: MicroStrategy stock surges on Nasdaq-100 inclusion announcement

Investing.com -- MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) shares popped 6% in premarket trading Monday as investors welcomed the Friday announcement from the Nasdaq exchange operator that the stock will be added to the Nasdaq-100 index. The move follows a dramatic rise in the shares of the Bitcoin-focused company. The inclusion will take effect before the market opens on December 23. Being added to the index often boosts a stock price, as funds that track the Nasdaq-100 typically buy shares of the newly included firms to align with the index's composition. In addition to MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR), a data analytics firm, and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), known for its Taser products, will also be added to the index. Meanwhile, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), a maker of gene-sequencing equipment, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), which specializes in AI servers, and vaccine maker Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) are set to be removed. MicroStrategy, which has aggressively invested in Bitcoin, has seen its stock skyrocket more than sixfold this year, boosting its market capitalization to nearly $94 billion. The company shifted its strategy in 2020, using Bitcoin as a reserve asset amid declining revenue from its software business. Today, it holds the title of the largest corporate owner of the cryptocurrency. Analysts suggest that MicroStrategy’s pivot to Bitcoin has made its stock more attractive, as its performance closely mirrors the cryptocurrency's fluctuations. Bernstein analysts predict that the Nasdaq-100 inclusion could pave the way for potential S&P 500 inclusion by 2025. They also see the company's prospects continuing to improve next year, adding they anticipate "more visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows," as a result of the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. Bitcoin has surged in recent weeks, fueled by optimism within the crypto sector following US President-elect Donald Trump's victory, which has raised expectations of reduced regulatory hurdles. Earlier this month, the cryptocurrency crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time.

By Medha Singh (Reuters) -MicroStrategy shares briefly surged on Monday before faltering to end nearly unchanged, after the software company and bitcoin stockpiler was selected to join the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, further brightening the prospects of the stock. The $25.7 trillion index that houses the largest non-financial companies will now gain indirect exposure to bitcoin via MicroStrategy, which holds $44 billion worth of the digital currency on its balance sheet, about 2% of the total supply of the world's largest cryptocurrency. The prospect of more buying from funds that track the Nasdaq 100 could further boost MicroStrategy's stock that has surged nearly 550% this year alongside a jump in the bitcoin price. Its share price rose as much as 7% on Monday before running out of steam to close 0.042% lower It could be "the start of a looping cycle of capital that could potentially drive up the spot BTC price," said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital. "ETFs such as QQQ and many others would buy MicroStrategy to mirror holdings of the index, therefore driving up the price, and in turn, allowing MicroStrategy to purchase more BTC through debt, bond and equity offerings." The fifth largest U.S. exchange-traded fund Invesco QQQ Trust tracks the Nasdaq 100 and has $328 billion in assets under management, according to data analytics company VettaFi. Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its strategic oil reserve. MicroStrategy's shares have gained 3,200% since adopting bitcoin as its treasury asset in 2020 under the leadership of co-founder Michael Saylor. The company has more than doubled its bitcoin holdings this year through convertible note offerings and share sales. It reported a net loss of $340 million in the three months ended Sept. 20, its third consecutive quarterly loss. "MicroStrategy's bitcoin strategy is a long-term, high-conviction 'buy and hold' strategy," said Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. The company's market capitalization rose to over $100 billion as its share price climbed, more than twice the value of its bitcoin stockpile. At the close it was valued at almost $98 billion. Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) and some small biotech firms including Enlivex Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ENLV) and Hoth Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HOTH) have also decided to allocate portions of their cash to bitcoin. "Longer term, this is a huge milestone for crypto and we are bound to hear the voices, both bulls and bears, get a lot louder talking about MicroStrategy and Saylor in the months to come," Dibb said. Short sellers, or investors betting against MicroStrategy's shares, have lost a total of $9.7 billion since the beginning of the year. Other entrants to the Nasdaq 100 include Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), Nasdaq said late on Friday, replacing Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), Super Micro and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). The reconstituted index will begin trading on Dec. 23.

Photo Credit: Reuters MicroStrategy started buying and holding BTC in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned MicroStrategy will be added to the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index, the exchange operator said on Friday, following a meteoric surge in the shares of the bitcoin buyer. The change comes into effect before the market opens on Dec. 23, Nasdaq said. Inclusion in the index typically boosts the stock's price, as exchange-traded funds looking to replicate the index's performance buy shares of the newly included firm. Data analytics firm Palantir Technologies and Taser maker Axon Enterprise were added to the Nasdaq-100 Index along with MicroStrategy. Gene-sequencing equipment maker Illumina, AI server maker Super Micro Computer and vaccine maker Moderna were removed, Nasdaq said. MicroStrategy, an aggressive investor in the world's largest crypto asset, has seen its shares soar more than six-fold this year, taking its market value to almost $94 billion (roughly Rs. 7,97,387 crore). The company began buying and holding bitcoin in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned. It is now the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Analysts have said MicroStrategy's decision to purchase bitcoin to protect the value of its reserve assets has enhanced the appeal of its stock, which tends to align with the performance of the cryptocurrency. Bernstein analysts expect the market will likely set its sights on S&P 500 inclusion for MicroStrategy in 2025 following the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. The brokerage also sees the company's prospects continuing to improve next year, adding it expects "more visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows," as a result of the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. Bitcoin has rallied in recent weeks as US President-elect Donald Trump's victory heightened the crypto sector's hopes for easing regulatory roadblocks. Earlier this month, the digital asset catapulted above $100,000 (roughly Rs.84.8 lakh) for the first time. "Management has shown no signs of slowing this (bitcoin-buying) down and are comfortable buying bitcoin in the $95,000 (roughly Rs. 80.5 lakh) - $100,000 (roughly Rs. 84.8 lakh) range," Bernstein analysts said. The company held roughly 423,650 bitcoins bought for about $25.6 billion (roughly Rs. 2,17,148 crore) based on the average purchase price as of December 8. The investment is worth around $42.43 billion (roughly Rs. 3,59,905 crore), based on bitcoin's previous close, according to Reuters calculations. © Thomson Reuters 2024 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

The 45% discount ($68 off) is by far the best deal yet on the omnibus collecting a treasure trove of comic book tales set in the world of the Arkham video games. Amazon says orders placed now (December 16) will arrive before Christmas, but make sure to double-check the shipping estimate if you're buying the omnibus for a Batman fan. The Arkham Saga Omnibus is far from the only awesome Batman deal available this holiday season. We've rounded up deals on Batman Lego sets, Blu-ray box sets, and the Meta Quest 3S Batman: Arkham Shadow bundle below the omnibus. $82 ($150) After Batman: Arkham Asylum became a huge hit in 2009, DC Comics didn't waste any time creating extra content for fans to dig into.

The full list for this collection includes: These are all great miniseries and one-shots featuring several of DC's best creators at the helm, and Batman: Arkham Unhinged is notable for being a digital-first series that has been added to this collection. While it was later reprinted in traditional comic book form, it is nice to have it included with the other series in this omnibus. Another cool thing about this hardcover is that the Arkham City series was illustrated by Carlos D'Anda, who worked with Rocksteady to create several unique redesigns for Batman and his rogues gallery in the Arkham games. Batman: Arkham Collection $7.49 (was $60) If you haven't played all three Arkham games by Rocksteady, you can get Batman: Arkham Collection for PC (Steam keys) for only $7.49 at GameSpot sister site Fanatical.

Based on his appearance in The Dark Knight, the Batman Construction Figure is a buildable action figure that can attach to the functional Bat-Pod Bike. Together., the two builds add up to 713 pieces. The purple Batmobile is based on its iconic look from Batman: The Animated Series. This 435-piece Lego set includes three minifigures: Batman, Harley Quinn, and Mr. Freeze. Both of those sets released in August alongside the Batman Mech Armor Lego Set, a small 140-piece build that's discounted to only $10 (was $15) at Amazon.

Here's a list of the best Batman 4K Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD deals at Amazon. Some of these deals aren't quite as good as Amazon had during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but a bunch of them are pretty close. And in the case of the 85th Anniversary Collection, Amazon's current deal is actually better. Also, always-popular The Dark Knight Trilogy on 4K Blu-ray is only a few bucks more than its $30 Black Friday deal. The Batman Arkham series returned in October with Batman: Arkham Shadow, a virtual reality action game that's exclusive to the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, which launched alongside the game. All new Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets come bundled with Arkham Shadow for free for a limited time.

U.S. stock indexes drifted through mixed trading ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes drifted amid mixed trading Monday, ahead of this week’s upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, coming off its first losing week in the last four. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to a record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a laggard and fell 110 points, or 0.3%. Broadcom leaped 11.2% to help lead the S&P 500 for a second straight day after delivering a profit report last week that beat analysts’ expectations. The technology company is riding a wave of enthusiasm about its artificial-intelligence offerings in particular. The market’s main event, though, will arrive on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve will announce its last move on interest rates for the year. The widespread expectation is that it will cut its main rate for a third straight time, as it tries to boost the slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%. The question is how much more it will cut rates next year, and Fed officials will release projections for where they see the federal funds rate ending 2025, along with other economic indicators, once their meeting concludes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions in a press conference following the meeting. For now, the general expectation among traders is that the Fed may cut a couple more times in 2025, according to data from CME Group. But such expectations have been shrinking following reports suggesting inflation may be tougher to get all the way down to 2% from here. Besides last month’s slight acceleration in inflation, another worry is that President-elect Donald Trump’s preferences for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation down the line. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle has dropped his earlier forecast of a cut by the Fed in January, for example. Beyond the possibility of tariffs, he said Fed officials may also want to slow their cuts because of uncertainty about exactly how low rates need to go so that they no longer press the brakes on the economy. Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times so far this year and is heading for one of its best years of the millennium. The economy has held up better than many feared, continuing to grow even after the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to a two-decade high in hopes of grinding down on inflation, which topped 9% two summers ago. On Wall Street, MicroStrategy jumped as much as 7% during the day as it continues to benefit from the surging price for bitcoin, which set another all-time high. But its stock ended the day down by les than 0.1% after bitcoin’s price pulled back below $106,000 after setting a record above $107,700, according to CoinDesk. The software company has been building its hoard of the cryptocurrency, and its stock price has more than sextupled this year. It will also soon join the Nasdaq 100 index. Bitcoin’s price has catapulted from roughly $44,000 at the start of the year, riding a recent wave of enthusiasm that Trump will create a system that’s more favorable to digital currencies. Honeywell rose 3.7% after saying it’s still considering a spin-off or sale of its aerospace business, as part of a review of its overall business. It said it plans to give an update with the release of its fourth-quarter results. They helped offset a drop for Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world’s move into AI. Its stock fell 1.7%. Because it’s grown so massive, with a total value topping $3 trillion, it was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500. All told, the S&P 500 rose 22.99 points to 6,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 110.58 to 43,717.48, and the Nasdaq composite rose 247.17 to 20,173.89. In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.39% from 4.40% late Friday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, eased to 4.24% from 4.25%. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell modestly across much of Europe and Asia. They sank 0.9% in Hong Kong and 0.2% in Shanghai after China reported lackluster economic indicators for November despite attempts to strengthen the world’s second-largest economy.

Title: Is Tilray Brands (TLRY) Among the Best Cannabis Stocks To Invest In?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Cannabis Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) stands against the other best cannabis stocks to invest in. The history of cannabis cultivation in America dates back to the early colonists, who grew hemp for textiles and rope. The plant was also widely used as a patent medicine during the 19th and early 20th centuries, described in the United States Pharmacopeia for the first time in 1850. Several political and racial factors led to the criminalization of cannabis in 1937 with the passage of the Marijuana Tax Act, but its legal status is now finally changing in many places. READ ALSO: 20 States with the Highest Weed Consumption in the US The United States of America is the country that consumes the most weed in the world. As we mentioned in our article – 30 Cities with the Highest Weed Consumption in the US – the American legal cannabis industry fared well in 2023 as legal sales across the 38 states that allow some form of regulated marijuana reached $28.8 billion, a 10.3% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, the legal cannabis industry also added 22,952 new jobs last year – a sign that the national business climate has somewhat stabilized following the turmoil of the previous two years. According to the 2024 Vangst Jobs Report, there were over 440,445 jobs supported by legal cannabis nationwide as of early 2024, an increase of 5.4% from 2023. The increasing legalization of cannabis and rising acceptance of its use for medical purposes are the key factors fueling the industry. Growth is also expected to come from new markets. One such example is Nebraska’s vote in favor of legalizing medical marijuana last month. As of the writing of this article, 24 states have legalized recreational weed in America, in addition to the District of Columbia. However, possessing or selling marijuana remains a crime under federal law, punishable by prison time and fines. In a significant setback for America’s legal cannabis industry, Florida voters rejected a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in November. The measure, known as Amendment 3, got 55.9% support, failing to meet the required 60% threshold. This was despite historic levels of funding, a rigorous advertising campaign, and even an endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump. Florida, with its population of 20 million people, is already home to the country’s largest medical marijuana market, boasting an annual revenue of $2 billion. The Sunshine State is also a popular tourist destination (especially during spring break) and attracts more than 140 million tourists every year. If Amendment 3 had been passed, Florida was expected to become a $6 billion cannabis market by 2026. Through the Smart & Safe Campaign, Florida’s cannabis companies and individual donors collectively contributed more than $150 million to get legalization enacted into law, with most of it coming from the largest medical marijuana operator in the state. On the other hand, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who aggressively campaigned against Amendment 3, spent an estimated $50 million of taxpayer money on radio and television ads to successfully convince enough voters to reject the measure. Meanwhile, hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin also came out against legalization and donated $12 million to the Vote No On 3 campaign. This setback inevitably had an impact on cannabis stocks, which witnessed a downturn following the news of the rejection. Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF, the first US ETF to target the global cannabis industry, has fallen by almost 30% since November 4, closing at $2.33 on December 13, 2024. Florida voters will now have to wait for two more years before cannabis legalization can get back on the ballot. A laboratory with white-coated technicians carefully measuring out cannabis extracts. To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 11 companies operating in the cannabis sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year instead. Following are the Best Cannabis Stocks According to Most Hedge Funds. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16 The New York-based Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) has a highly diversified global portfolio – operating in more than 20 countries with businesses in medical adult-use cannabis, beverages, spirits, wellness products, and a vast array of consumer-connected lifestyle brands. The core business of Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) is cannabis and it is the number one cannabis business in Canada, the leading medical cannabis business across Europe, and the top branded hemp business in North America. The company has lately been very active in acquiring other industry players to expand its presence and the strategy seems to be paying off. For example, its acquisition of Redecan in June 2023 has helped it gain a strong footing in categories like pre-rolls, oils, and capsules. As a result, Redecan has now moved up to the number six position in Canada as reported by Hifyre data, and now the brand is also launching in Australia. Moreover, in September, Tilray entered the lucrative US THC beverage market with a range of Delta-9 THC mocktails and seltzers through its newly formed Tilray Alternative Beverages business unit. Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) forayed into the alcohol sector last year when it acquired eight beer and beverage brands from Anheuser-Busch InBev for an undisclosed amount, making it the 5th largest craft beer business in the US with a 4.5% market share. To further strengthen its craft portfolio, the company announced in August that it had agreed to acquire another four craft beer brands from Molson Coors – Hop Valley Brewing Company, Terrapin Beer Co., Revolver Brewing, and Atwater Brewery. This venture seems to be bearing fruit, as Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY)’s alcohol business now accounts for 28% of its revenue. Overall, the company’s beverage segment, including craft beer, spirits, non-alcoholic beers, and other drinks grew 132% in net revenue YoY during the fiscal Q1 of 2025. With 16 hedge fund investors tracked by IM at the end of Q3 2024, Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) was also included in our list of the Best Beer Stocks to Buy Now. Overall, TLRY ranks 2nd on our list of the best cannabis stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential for TLRY to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TLRY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The buzz around generative artificial intelligence (AI) and expectations of falling interest rates are driving several technology stocks higher. While there are concerns about stretched valuations, Wall Street analysts continue to see further upside in many tech names. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we placed Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Alibaba (BABA) against each other to find the tech stock that could offer the highest upside potential from current levels, according to analysts. Discover top-rated stocks from highly ranked analysts with Analyst Top Stocks! Easily identify outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Apple shares have risen about 29% so far this year. The iPhone maker impressed investors with better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. The company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 12% to $1.64, with sales rising 6% to $94.9 billion. Notably, revenue from iPhone, which accounted for about 49% of the overall sales, grew 5.5% to $46.2 billion. Moreover, revenue from Services, which is a higher-margin business compared to Apple’s products, grew 12% to about $25 billion. Apple expects its Services revenue growth in the December quarter to be nearly the same as its growth rate in the past year (12.9%). Further, the company expects its December overall sales to rise by “low to mid-single digit.” While there are concerns about the impact of competition on iPhone sales in key markets like China, several analysts remain confident about the company due to its growing Services business and AI initiatives like Apple Intelligence. Baird analyst William Power raised the price target for Apple stock to $260 from $240 while reiterating a Buy rating. Power noted that AAPL currently trades at 32.8x of the calendar year 2025 EPS estimate, reflecting about a 50% premium to the S&P 500’s (SPX) multiple of 22x. He added that his $260 target price is based on a 34x P/E multiple (calculated on 2025 EPS forecast), placing it towards the high end of the stock’s 10-35x historical range and a premium to other tech and consumer leaders. Power explained that the premium valuation reflects solid execution, growing contribution from Services, continued eco-system benefits, and impressive free cash flow. With 20 Buys, nine Holds, and two Sells, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Apple stock. The average AAPL stock price target of $243.20 implies 2% downside risk. See more AAPL analyst ratings Semiconductor giant Nvidia’s shares have rallied more than 171% year-to-date, driven by the robust demand for its advanced GPUs (graphics processing units) that are required for powering generative AI models and applications. Last month, Nvidia reported market-beating results for the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. Revenue grew 94% year-over-year to $35.1 billion, while adjusted EPS jumped 103% to $0.81. Despite strong Q3 results, there have been some concerns about the slowdown in revenue growth. Additionally, investors are worried about the longevity of the AI-induced demand. Nonetheless, Nvidia is optimistic about its future prospects, supported by robust demand for its Hopper and Blackwell platforms amid the generative AI boom. Following the Q3 print, Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso raised the price target on NVIDIA stock to $180 from $150 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst said that the new price target is based on a P/E (price-to-earnings) multiple of about 42x his 2025 (calendar year) EPS estimate of $4.26, which is slightly above the stock’s nearly 37x average multiple over the past five years. Caso further contended that the P/E multiple of 42x is reasonable given his expectation for almost 50% revenue growth next year. The analyst said that NVDA had been his favorite stock for several years, and continues to be so, given that it is the chief beneficiary of the AI wave. Caso thinks there is a clear path to over $200 billion in data center revenue based on supply chain forecasts related to the Blackwell ramp, which could drive an EPS of $5 in Fiscal 2026. Coming to the consensus rating, Nvidia scores a Strong Buy based on 37 buys and three Hold recommendations. At $176.14, the average NVDA stock price target implies 31.2% upside potential. See more NVDA analyst ratings Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba recently announced upbeat earnings for the September quarter. Net income jumped 58% to RMB 43.9 billion, driven by the rise in operating income and mark-to-market changes in equity investments. Meanwhile, revenue grew 5% to RMB 236.5 billion even as macro pressures continue to impact consumer spending. In a statement on the September quarter results, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu stated that the company is more confident about its core businesses and continues to invest in its long-term growth. BABA shares have advanced more than 15% so far this year, partially due to the optimism about the stimulus measures being assured by the Chinese government to boost the economy. Despite macro uncertainty and the US-China tensions, several analysts are bullish on BABA due to its restructuring efforts, the company’s cloud business, and AI-related growth opportunities. It is worth noting that the growth in Alibaba’s Cloud business accelerated in the September quarter compared to the prior quarters, with revenue from public cloud products increasing by double digits and AI-related product revenue witnessing triple-digit growth. Recently, Alibaba announced that it will integrate its domestic Chinese and international e-commerce platforms into a single business unit (called the E-commerce Business Group) amid intense competition. The company aims to create synergies in its supply chain with this move. Reacting to this announcement, Citi analyst Alicia Yap reaffirmed a Buy rating on Alibaba stock and stated that she views the announcement positively. The analyst, who has a price target of $133 on BABA stock, noted that this step could fuel synergies across Alibaba’s Taobao Tmall Group and the International Digital Commerce Group, driving improvement in operations and financial performance. Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks, backed by 14 Buys versus one Hold rating. The average BABA stock price target of $127.05 implies about 45% upside potential. See more BABA analyst ratings Wall Street is highly bullish on Alibaba and Nvidia stocks but cautiously optimistic about Apple. Analysts see higher upside potential in Alibaba stock than in the stocks of the other two tech giants, thanks to improving fundamentals, AI-related prospects, and the Chinese government’s stimulus measures. Interestingly, as per TipRanks’ Smart Score System, both Alibaba and Nvidia score a “Perfect 10,” implying that both these stocks are well-positioned to outperform the broader market over the long term.

Title: Cramer on Delta Airlines (DAL): Best of Breed with Premium Revenue Boost

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 6 Airline Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) stands against the other airline stocks that Jim Cramer has talked about. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the current state of airline stocks, many of which have seen impressive gains in recent months. “I always say that these typically make better trades than investments, they're very different. So, after this kind of run, my gut tells me maybe to ring the register before the music stops and the light comes on. But I’m also open to the idea that maybe things, things can change. If there's reason to believe that the airlines are suddenly less cyclical, less boom and bust, then maybe this time really is different.” Cramer identified a few key factors driving the surge in airline stocks. Earlier this year, the airline sector was weighed down by concerns over consumer spending. While these concerns have not entirely dissipated, the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts have reduced some of the pressure. Cramer pointed out that while consumer spending has cooled from last year’s levels, travel has remained a consistent area of demand. He said that consumer sentiment has also been improving over the past few months, providing further support for this view. READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024 and 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts One of the most significant positive changes for the airline industry, according to Cramer, is the resurgence of business travelers post-pandemic. Business travelers tend to be less price-sensitive than leisure travelers, which provides a reliable revenue stream for airlines. He went on to say: “I'm much more impressed by some big structural change in the industry that many people aren't noticing. The single most important positive development for the airline over the past few months is the fact that domestic airline capacity has stopped going up as much as in previous years.” He said that after the pandemic, airlines began ramping up their route offerings to capitalize on the surge in demand, known as the revenge travel boom. However, as Cramer explained, this expansion of capacity has historically been problematic for the industry. During boom periods, airlines add too many routes and flights, but when demand slows, they are left with excess capacity, which erodes their pricing power. This, in turn, leads to lower profitability. In contrast, Cramer observed that since the first half of 2024, the airlines have been much more disciplined, with capacity growth slowing considerably. While capacity grew around 7% in the first half of the year, it appears that in the second half, the growth will be in the low single digits. Cramer also pointed out that part of the reason for this newfound capacity discipline is that many low-cost carriers, which have been a major driver of supply growth in the past two decades, are now struggling. So, can airline stocks continue their upward trajectory? Cramer believes the strength in the sector can persist as long as the airlines maintain their discipline with capacity management. However, he expressed some uncertainty about how long this trend will last. For now, though, he said that the airlines are saying the right things, with all the major players appearing to act in concert in a way Cramer has never seen before. “In the end, the airline stocks have been white hot for months now, in part because the economy's doing better, but mainly because the industry stopped adding new planes willy-nilly and it finally gave them pricing power. The bottom line: As long as the airlines don't add too many new flights, I think the major carriers like United, Delta, and American, they can keep on flying.” For this article, we compiled a list of 6 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57 Cramer said that Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) is “best of breed” and noted that the stock has gained quite a lot in the past several months. “We need to talk about the remarkable run in the airline stocks over the past few months… Delta Airlines… we consider the best of breed, has soared nearly 70%.” Delta (NYSE:DAL) is a major provider of air transportation services, catering to both passengers and cargo across a wide range of domestic and international routes. During its Investor Day, the airline projected strong sales growth in 2025, anticipating a boost in revenue due to a solid economy and continued demand for premium and international travel. The company expects revenue to grow in the mid-teens in the coming year, though it also anticipates that costs, excluding fuel, will rise. Premium products have become an increasingly important source of revenue for it. The company reported that its premium offerings, including premium seats and its loyalty program, account for 57% of its overall revenue. In comparison, main cabin seating now represents 43% of Delta’s earnings. The company has also set a target to see sales from premium seats alone surpass revenue from coach seats by 2027. Delta (NYSE:DAL) President, Glenn Hauenstein, has previously discussed improvements in the company’s capacity management in previous statements to investors. He noted that the excess capacity observed during the summer months began to improve by August, helping to boost revenue trends as the airline entered the fall season, typically a quieter period for travel. Overall, DAL ranks first on our list of airline stocks that Jim Cramer has talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of DAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DAL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024 and 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts One of the most significant positive changes for the airline industry, according to Cramer, is the resurgence of business travelers post-pandemic. Business travelers tend to be less price-sensitive than leisure travelers, which provides a reliable revenue stream for airlines. He went on to say: “I'm much more impressed by some big structural change in the industry that many people aren't noticing. The single most important positive development for the airline over the past few months is the fact that domestic airline capacity has stopped going up as much as in previous years.” He said that after the pandemic, airlines began ramping up their route offerings to capitalize on the surge in demand, known as the revenge travel boom. However, as Cramer explained, this expansion of capacity has historically been problematic for the industry. During boom periods, airlines add too many routes and flights, but when demand slows, they are left with excess capacity, which erodes their pricing power. This, in turn, leads to lower profitability. In contrast, Cramer observed that since the first half of 2024, the airlines have been much more disciplined, with capacity growth slowing considerably. While capacity grew around 7% in the first half of the year, it appears that in the second half, the growth will be in the low single digits. Cramer also pointed out that part of the reason for this newfound capacity discipline is that many low-cost carriers, which have been a major driver of supply growth in the past two decades, are now struggling. So, can airline stocks continue their upward trajectory? Cramer believes the strength in the sector can persist as long as the airlines maintain their discipline with capacity management. However, he expressed some uncertainty about how long this trend will last. For now, though, he said that the airlines are saying the right things, with all the major players appearing to act in concert in a way Cramer has never seen before. “In the end, the airline stocks have been white hot for months now, in part because the economy's doing better, but mainly because the industry stopped adding new planes willy-nilly and it finally gave them pricing power. The bottom line: As long as the airlines don't add too many new flights, I think the major carriers like United, Delta, and American, they can keep on flying.” For this article, we compiled a list of 6 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Highlighting that United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) stock has risen over the past month, Cramer also noted its management’s comment on capacity management. “United is up an astounding 159%… Let's consider the case of United Airlines, best performer. When the company reported second-quarter results in July, they noted that the capacity had grown 8% year-over-year that quarter, reflecting the industry-wide trends. But they also said that they believed that that trend was ending. United explained that the industry would be removing unprofitable capacity in the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. In October, when United reported… CEO Scott Kirby… very proudly said, I'm gonna quote it, ‘The inflection we spoke about on our last call has happened and we're seeing unprofitable capacity begin to exit the market, leading to the expected domestic yield improvement.’ The company's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella then added, ‘United's domestic capacity in 2024 was shaped with the expectation that the industry would remove unprofitable capacity in earnest in Q4. As a result, United expanded slower than most during the first three quarters of the year when capacity dynamics were less favorable. But importantly, our timing is right, tilting our growth to the quarter where the industry conditions would be the best.’ I can't believe that these guys are saying this stuff.” United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) operates as a major provider of air transportation services, offering both passenger and cargo services. According to the airline, domestic passenger revenue per available seat mile (RASM) showed a slight year-over-year improvement in both August and September, marking a significant recovery from earlier in the quarter when it had been down by 4%. Management attributed this positive shift to the maturation of capacity added in 2022 and 2023, which helped drive the improved RASM results. Looking ahead, management expressed optimism regarding United’s performance in Latin America, citing the ongoing capacity rationalization by low-margin airlines in the region. They expect this trend to benefit the airline’s operations in the coming quarters. Additionally, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) management noted that revenue trends also improved across most geographic areas, helped by the industry’s capacity rationalization and a decline in fuel prices, which provided some relief to cost pressures. Overall, UAL ranks 2nd on our list of airline stocks that Jim Cramer has talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of UAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UAL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 2024 was big for bitcoin. States could see a crypto policy blitz in 2025 in spite of the risks

The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses that, together, could push states to become more open to crypto and for public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it. Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to criticize government-backed currencies as prone to devaluation and say increased government buy-in will stabilize bitcoin's future price swings, give it more legitimacy and further boost an already rising price. But the risks are significant. Critics say a crypto investment is highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting its future returns, and warn that investors should be prepared to lose money. Only a couple public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency and a new U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued in recent days, warned it has “uniquely high volatility” and that it found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto. It has already been a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin hitting $100,000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts being cheered by Trump's promise to make the United States the “bitcoin superpower” of the world. Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills in 2025 to make them crypto-friendly as analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby, bitcoin miners build new installations and venture capitalists underwrite a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback. A bill introduced last month in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir. “I had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, ‘Oh my god, I’m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,” said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell. Cabell — a bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid — expects his bill to be reintroduced by a colleague. And leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect bills based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states next year. Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn’t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto. Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek. “There might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,” Brainard said. “But it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.” In Louisiana, Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system by which people can pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies. Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather sees the step as a recognition that government must innovate and be flexible in helping people make financial transactions with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto. Fleming recalled meeting with a bitcoin lobbyist recently and came away unconvinced that bitcoin makes for a good investment. “My concern is that at some point it’ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,” Fleming said. “And when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.” In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation. Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said. Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin. That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York. Pension boards got investment tools they like this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and, in October, approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said. Many “are likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that’s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,” Palmer said. Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs. In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it. Michigan's state investment board later reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto. Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund. “We were ahead of the curve," Fulop said. “And I think that’s what you’re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. The Nasdaq outperformsU.S. stocks ended Friday mixed. The S&P 500 was flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% for its seventh straight day of losses and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.12%. Shares of Broadcom jumped 24%, launching it into the trillion-dollar market capitalization club. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 fell 0.53% to end the week in the red, snapping a three-week winning streak. OpenAI opens up about MuskOpenAI co-founder Elon Musk pushed to create a new for-profit structure for the company in 2017, OpenAI alleged in a blog post. However, "when he didn't get majority equity and full control, he walked away," wrote OpenAI alongside screenshots of Musk's email. In November, Musk asked a federal court to block OpenAI from converting to a for-profit entity. Tech companies donate to TrumpTechnology companies that have a history of clashes with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are donating to his inauguration. Meta donated $1 million, the company confirmed to CNBC, Amazon is planning to donate the same amount, according to The Wall Street Journal and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is making a personal donation also of the same amount, according to the company. South Korea president impeachedSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached on Saturday after 204 lawmakers in the National Assembly voted in favor of the motion. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will serve as acting president. On Sunday, Han spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden, and the country's finance ministry said it would continue monitoring markets. [PRO] Eyes on rates and pricesInterest rates and inflation are in focus this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting ends Wednesday, while the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation because it reflects how consumers actually spend money, comes out on Friday. A near-surefire of figuring out where markets are heading is to make a prediction — and disregard it. The S&P 500 may have slipped 0.6% last week, snapping its three-week winning streak. But it's still up almost 27% this year, shattering the 6,000 level for the first time on its journey upward. That's way ahead of forecasts made by top financial strategists at the end of 2023, notes CNBC's Pia Singh. JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, for instance, expected the broad-based index to close the year at just 4,200. Even the most optimistic prediction — a 5,200 target from John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer — didn't capture the exuberant stock rally this year. And that's why even though market strategists anticipate the S&P to finish 2025 at 6,630, according to the average forecast from the CNBC Market Strategist Survey, investors should take it with a pinch of salt. Granted, there's positive sentiment bubbling among investors, thanks to Trump's high regard for the stock market as a barometer for his presidential tenure, steadily loosening monetary policy, the prospect of lower corporate taxes, among other factors. But, in markets — as in life — the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry. Inflation might make an unwelcome return — like measles and possibly polio in the U.S. — because of Trump's promised tariffs and the tit-for-tat trade wars that could ensue. Indeed, inflation already "looks a little stuck," said Goldman Sachs' vice chairman Robert Kaplan, previously president of the Dallas Fed. Still, despite my skepticism of predictions, I'd love it if Bank of America's Savita Subramanian proves to be a prescient market forecaster. Imagine ending 2025 with the S&P at Subramanian's target of 6,666. — CNBC's Sarah Min, Pia Singh, Sean Conlon and Samantha Subin contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Hackaday Links: December 15, 2024

It looks like we won’t have Cruise to kick around in this space anymore with the news that General Motors is pulling the plug on its woe-beset robotaxi project. Cruise, which GM acquired in 2016, fielded autonomous vehicles in various test markets, but the fleet racked up enough high-profile mishaps (first item) for California regulators to shut down test programs in the state last year. The inevitable layoffs ensued, and GM is now killing off its efforts to build robotaxis to concentrate on incorporating the Cruise technology into its “Super Cruise” suite of driver-assistance features for its full line of cars and trucks. We feel like this might be a tacit admission that surmounting the problems of fully autonomous driving is just too hard a nut to crack profitably with current technology, since Super Cruise uses eye-tracking cameras to make sure the driver is paying attention to the road ahead when automation features are engaged. Basically, GM is admitting there still needs to be meat in the seat, at least for now. Speaking of accidents, the results of the first aircraft accident investigation on another world were released this week, and there were a few surprises. Ingenuity, the little helicopter that hitched a ride to Mars in the belly of the Perseverance rover in 2021, surpassed all expectations by completing 71 flights successfully and becoming an integral part of the search for ancient life on Mars. But flight 72 proved to be a bridge too far and ended with a hard landing that terminally damaged its rotor system. At the time it was speculated that the relatively bland terrain it was flying over at the time of the accident was the root cause. This was confirmed by analysis of the flight logs, but the degree to which the flight computer’s down-looking navigation camera was confused by the featureless dunes is new information. As for why the rotor blades broke, it doesn’t appear that it was because they impacted the surface. Rather, as Scott Manley points out, the blades appear to have broken at their weakest point due to extreme flexing induced by the high vertical speed while touching down on a slope, which caused one set of legs to hit the surface before the others. Also roughly in the realm of space-based failures comes the story of a hapless senior citizen in New York who has been issued thousands of dollars in traffic tickets because of her love for Star Trek. Years ago, Long Island resident Beda Koorey got a New York vanity license plate for her car emblazoned with “NCC-1701,” the registration number of the USS Enterprise. She turned in those plates years ago when she gave up driving, but in the meantime, novelty NCC-1701 plates began popping up on Amazon and other sites. They were clearly not intended to be used on cars, but that didn’t stop some people from putting them on over their real plates in an attempt to defeat traffic cameras. It worked, at least from their point of view, since it left poor Beda with a collection of tickets for speeding and red light violations from as far away as Chicago. She even got a ticket for a violation committed by a motorcycle with a phony plate, which you think would not map to the registration for an automobile, but there you go. We always knew it was hard to be a Trekkie, especially back in the ’70s, but at least it never cost us much money. It did cost us a lot of dates, though. We featured plenty of stories of start-up tech companies with the next must-have IoT device that fold up shop after a few years and abandon their users by effectively bricking their widgets. Heck, we’ve even suffered that fate ourselves; curse you, Logitech, for killing the SqueezeBox. However, one company recently took IoT bricking to a new low by ending support for a line of AI-powered companion bots for kids. The company was called Embodied, and they hawked $800 AI bots for kids called Moxie, with a cute face and a huggable form factor that kids couldn’t help falling in love with. Embodied couldn’t make a go of it financially and since Moxie uses a cloud-based LLM to interact with kids, the bots are now bricked. This leaves parents who invested in these devices with the quandary of having to explain to young kids that their robot pal is dead. Some of the TikToks of parents breaking the news are heartbreaking, and we can’t help but think that this is a perfect opportunity for someone in our community to reverse-engineer these things and bring them back to life. And finally, the burning of the Yule Log is an ancient tradition, one that reminds us of the time our grandfather brought an entire telephone pole that had washed up on the beach home and burned it for days on end, feeding it slowly into the fireplace in the living room through the open front door. Good times. Not everyone is blessed with a fireplace in their abode, though, which has given rise to the popularity of video Yule Logs that you can just play on your TV. And now NASA is in on the action with an eight-hour 4K video of the SLS main engines and boosters. Framed by a lovely stone fireplace and replete with crackling wood sound effects over the subdued roar of the four RS-25 engines and twin solid-fuel boosters, it’ll make a nice addition to your holiday festivities. Although given that NASA just announced that the next Artemis missions are delayed until at least 2026, we’re not sure that it’s a great idea to show a rocket that never lifts off. You’ll also want to be careful that the neighbors don’t see the action. CGI fireplace, NASA, you can do better than that. They tried it with a real fireplace but it melted the house. Not just CGI, but really bad AI-generated fireplace. I just love a fireplace with a comforting basket of amorphous beige shapes in front, and a lumpy grate…thing… glued to the wall. The actual video footage is also only about three seconds being looped. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL9-YhsEcQo Last year they did one that was just 45 minutes of RS-25 test footage with generic holiday music, which was honestly better. It seems like NASA has fired enough engines that it shouldn’t be hard to find a rocket engine filmed at a ridiculously high framerate so they could stretch a ten-second test into an hour or two of slow-motion. Could the air accident investigation be considered complete if JPL hasn’t recovered the “black box”? Mars doesn’t have much of an atmosphere, so they just have to get it all out of thin air :o) You win. I was in SF a little while ago and was surprised to see that what seemed like every third car was a driverless Waymo or whatever they are called. So full driverless is absolutely still a thing and not at all impossible with current tech. Which really surprised me because I thought California banned all driverless cars.

Title: What You Need To Know If You're Considering A Job Change
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2024/12/15/considering-a-job-change-in-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-15T21:30:00Z

A growing number of employees are ready to make a job change. Recent Gallup data reveals that more Americans are considering a job change than at any point in the last 10 years. U.S. employees feel increasingly frustrated and detached from their work—something Gallup calls the "Great Detachment." Even more interesting, a PwC survey conducted among over 56,000 workers in 50 countries shows that 28% of respondents are likely to change companies within the next 12 months. A growing number of employees are planning a job change due to increased workloads and the desire to improve their skills. “Employee desires to job-switch will be driven by a multitude of reasons, but notably this year, two-thirds who said they are likely to switch in the next 12 months said opportunities to learn new skills are a key factor...,” said Pete Brown, Global Workforce Leader at PwC UK. Other reasons to consider a job switch are fewer promotions, smaller raises and impending layoffs. Despite feeling stuck in dissatisfying roles, many people are waiting to make a move until they feel more confident about their future prospects. In the meantime, a number of workers have already started job searching. The perfect time to switch jobs may be just around the corner. If you’re restless in your current role and ready to make a job change, here’s what you need to know. With the U.S. election over, companies that paused planning have the clarity they need to make budget and hiring decisions for 2025. Some experts predict a slow resurgence with a more robust jobs market in Q3. “My expectation is that by Q2 we will start to see a slight pickup, and, by Q3, we will be in a pretty robust jobs market,” says Rajesh Namboothiry, SVP at Manpower. Recruiters also remain optimistic, with seven in 10 remaining confident about job growth and hiring demand in the next 12 months, according to a recent Recruiter.com and Findem survey. That’s great news for those individuals planning a job change. In ManpowerGroup’s 2024 Global Talent Shortage report, 75% of companies globally report having difficulty finding skilled talent. The skills shortage is caused mainly by rapid technological advancements, like generative AI. With innovative technological solutions emerging, new skills are required to operate them. As a result, organizations in various industries like healthcare, technology and engineering are turning to new-collar workers to fill critical skill gaps. A new-collar job refers to positions prioritizing skills over a traditional four-year college degree. People often develop these specialized skill sets through non-traditional education paths like boot camps, certification programs or on-the-job training. Some employers are even training their current workforce to fill these positions. While some high-profile organizations like Starbucks, Amazon and others issue return-to-office mandates, others are open to more flexible options. Research and advisory firm Metrigy recently released their Employee Engagement Optimization 2025 study, indicating that employers are modifying their strategies to strike the right balance between on-site and remote work. In 2025, over half of those surveyed plan to adjust their requirements to balance the need for internal collaboration with what employees want. In fact, structured hybrid models following a predefined schedule continue to grow in popularity. According to the Flex Index Q4 2024 Flex Report, 43% of U.S. firms now have a structured hybrid model—up from 20% in 2023. As AI and other technologies reshape industries, leaders increasingly recognize the importance of hiring professionals with soft skills. In LinkedIn’s recent Global Talent Trends report, 69% of U.S. executives say they plan to prioritize hiring candidates with these skills. Unlike technical skills, soft skills can’t be outsourced to AI and are highly transferable across functions and industries. These assets are also a powerful differentiator during job interviews. When hiring managers are choosing between two strong candidates with equal technical skills, soft skills are often the deciding factor. Workplace advisory platform meQuilibrium predicts that there will be a “manager crash” or a significant decline in manager performance and well-being in 2025. Over the past several years, companies have been engaged in reducing headcount, particularly middle managers. For example, Citigroup reduced 13 management layers to eight, while Amazon announced plans to increase its ratio of workers to supervisors by at least 15%. Most companies don’t intend to fill those roles, making it challenging for the remaining supervisors. The managers left behind take on much larger workloads and become increasingly disengaged. In addition, the lack of adequate company support puts managers at a higher risk of burnout and turnover than the people they supervise. If you intend to make a job change, focus on developing technical skills in high-demand areas. Also, prioritize building critical soft skills like adaptability, creative problem solving and collaboration. Stay updated on industry trends, network with thought leaders and evaluate your personal brand to give yourself a competitive edge. By planning strategically, you’ll go from feeling stuck to taking your career to a whole new level. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: St Mary’s extend their unbeaten run to six games

The Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A rollercoaster continued on its merry way in reaching the halfway point, with seven try-scoring bonus points and three losing bonus points decorating another eventful round. St Mary’s underlined their title credentials in their first season back in the top flight after a seven-year absence with a seventh attacking bonus point in their 32-26 win over Lansdowne in a Friday night streamed advert for the league on the Aviva back pitch; the lead exchanging hands four times. Lansdowne recovered from an early 12-0 deficit to lead 21-12 in the second half and scored four tries themselves through Barry Fitzpatrick, Cathal Eddy, Andy Marks and Louis McGauran. But with Conor Dean pulling the strings in another inventive display, St Mary’s extended their unbeaten run to six games through tries by Ethan Baxter, Colm Reilly, Mark Fogarty (two) and Richie Bergin. Lansdowne host 2A pacesetters Instonians in the Bateman Cup final on January 4th, a week ahead of the round 10 reverse fixtures. Although not at their best Clontarf moved up to second thanks to five tries from their power game, including another brace of maul tries by Dylan Donnellan, as well as one for replacement hooker Barry Gray, who had a big impact, in their 35-25 win at home to City of Armagh. Conor Kelly contributed another 15 points, while Armagh fullback Kyle Faloon completed his 15-point haul with a contender for try of the season but, alas, for no tangible reward. Defiant goal line defending was a theme at Lakelands Park where Terenure recorded their third win in succession by beating Ballynahinch 24-3. They led 5-3 at half-time thanks to the first of two tries by the returning Jordan Coghlan. They broke Hinch’s resistance when the in-form Leinster academy winger Henry McErlean scored from 90 minutes off a crosskick by Alan Bennie, before Adam la Grue created the bonus-point try by Conor McKeon. Cork Con had their bonus point by the 32nd minute as they roared into a 28-5 lead at home to UCD with tries by Adam Maher, Daniel Hurley, Aidan Moynihan and Seán French in a frenetic and fluctuating game at Temple Hill. But despite missing a number of their Leinster academy players the students bounced back to make it 28-26 after half-time before a brace of maul tries by replacement hooker Danny Sheehan ensured Con of the win. A second try by centre and captain James Tarrant ensured two bonus points for UCD for the second week running. A big crowd witnessed an entertaining Limerick derby at Tom Clifford Park in a Saturday teatime game where two tries by the largely uncontainable Bryan Fitzgerald and one by Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks in his 14-point haul had Garryowen on course to end a seven-match losing run. But although Young Munster’s outhalf Julian Leszczynski missed the conversion to Stephen McLoughlin’s bonus-point try, the Argentinian landed a late penalty to seal a 25-24 win for the home side. Old Belvedere maintained their hot pace in 1B with a 51-10 win in Naas, while second-placed Nenagh Ormond moved 10 points clear of the rest with a 34-25 win at UCC. Ryan Baird had some game-time off the bench in Dublin University’s 13-10 home win over Blackrock College Similarly, Instonians stayed atop 2B with a 33-21 win at home to Banbridge following Corinthians’ 64-0 Friday night win over free-falling Buccaneers. The match featured a hat-trick by hooker Max Holmes and a brace apiece for the Ireland under-20s and Connacht academy duo of centre John Devine and Seán Naughton, who scored 24 points. MU Barnhall leapfrogged Cashel with a 30-17 win at Parsonstown. Wanderers stay top of 2B despite a 26-24 loss in Skerries, while Galwegians made up some ground from seven narrow defeats with 24-7 win in Sligo. Midleton fought back for a late draw at Virgin Media Park to maintain their eight-point lead over Dolphin atop 2C. Men’s Division 1A: Lansdowne 26 St Mary’s College 32; Clontarf 35 City of Armagh 25; Cork Constitution 38 UCD 33; Terenure College 24 Ballynahinch 3; Young Munster 25 Garryowen 24.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 13 AI News That Broke the Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against other AI news that broke the internet. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, a new generation of AI systems is emerging. The new systems go beyond answering questions to autonomously completing tasks and solving problems. These “agentic” AI systems are set to revolutionize industries, from healthcare to finance, by taking on complex objectives and driving productivity in ways we have yet to fully experience. Matt Wood, PwC’s global commercial technology and innovation officer, discussed this evolution of AI on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’. He highlighted the transition from basic question-answering systems to more advanced agentic systems capable of completing tasks on behalf of users. These systems will be able to respond to objectives like booking flights or managing investments by creating and completing to-do lists autonomously. He predicts that within the next 12 months, agentic AI will become more integrated into everyday life, similar to how apps improve the functionality of smartphones. Wood also pointed out that AI is being adopted rapidly in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing due to existing investments in data governance, which provide a solid foundation for leveraging generative AI. READ ALSO: Top 15 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street and Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. According to a Bloomberg report from December 13, companies like OpenAI, Salesforce, and McKinsey are already deploying agents to improve efficiency and reduce the need for human intervention in routine tasks. Agents can take on roles like personal assistants, collaborative coworkers, and supervisors, enabling employees to focus on higher-value work. Although the agents won’t fully replace jobs, AI agents are expected to transform work environments, create new roles, and foster greater productivity, especially in sectors with complex, regulated processes. The widespread adoption of these agents could lead to changes in staffing models and workplace dynamics by 2025, with companies using fewer but more skilled workers. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). UbjsP/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) provides a range of energy solutions, including gas, nuclear, and wind technologies, along with grid, solar, and storage systems. The company focuses on electrification and power conversion, offering solutions to support the growing demand for electricity driven by AI and other technologies. GE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) has signed multiple contracts for natural gas turbines to power large data centers, with plans for 5-gigawatt campuses expected to begin operating by 2028, as reported by Bloomberg on December 12. In the past month alone, the company secured 9 gigawatts of turbine reservations from data center and power plant developers. The growing demand for electricity, driven by AI and other technologies, is forecast to significantly increase U.S. power consumption, and fossil fuels, especially natural gas, are expected to play a major role in meeting this demand. GE Vernova is also planning to integrate carbon capture technology at its facilities in the coming decade to reduce emissions. Overall, GEV ranks 6th on our list of AI news that broke the internet. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of 13 AI News That Broke the Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Hut 8 Corp. (NASDAQ:HUT) stands against other AI news that broke the internet. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, a new generation of AI systems is emerging. The new systems go beyond answering questions to autonomously completing tasks and solving problems. These “agentic” AI systems are set to revolutionize industries, from healthcare to finance, by taking on complex objectives and driving productivity in ways we have yet to fully experience. Matt Wood, PwC’s global commercial technology and innovation officer, discussed this evolution of AI on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’. He highlighted the transition from basic question-answering systems to more advanced agentic systems capable of completing tasks on behalf of users. These systems will be able to respond to objectives like booking flights or managing investments by creating and completing to-do lists autonomously. He predicts that within the next 12 months, agentic AI will become more integrated into everyday life, similar to how apps improve the functionality of smartphones. Wood also pointed out that AI is being adopted rapidly in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing due to existing investments in data governance, which provide a solid foundation for leveraging generative AI.

According to a Bloomberg report from December 13, companies like OpenAI, Salesforce, and McKinsey are already deploying agents to improve efficiency and reduce the need for human intervention in routine tasks. Agents can take on roles like personal assistants, collaborative coworkers, and supervisors, enabling employees to focus on higher-value work. Although the agents won’t fully replace jobs, AI agents are expected to transform work environments, create new roles, and foster greater productivity, especially in sectors with complex, regulated processes. The widespread adoption of these agents could lead to changes in staffing models and workplace dynamics by 2025, with companies using fewer but more skilled workers. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Local news channel WBRZ reported that West Feliciana Parish is set to host a $12 billion AI data center by Hut 8 (NASDAQ:HUT), which will create thousands of new jobs. Located off Hwy LA-964, the project follows the announcement of a Meta AI data center in the area. Hut 8 plans to complete the first phase by the end of 2025, which includes two 450,000-square-foot buildings and will employ 1,500 to 2,000 construction workers. The project will also bring permanent, high-end jobs in fields such as instrumentation, electrical work, welding, and pipefitting, boosting the local economy. Overall, HUT ranks 13th on our list of AI news that broke the internet. While we acknowledge the potential of HUT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently published a list of 12 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. The demand for energy-intensive AI data centers is outpacing supply, and while solutions like crypto site conversions, and nuclear power are promising, substantial action is needed to prevent significant power shortages in the near future. In an interview on CNBC’s ‘The Exchange,’ Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley discussed the potential for converting crypto mining sites into data centers to address the power shortage for AI data centers. He noted that while Bitcoin mining companies have lucrative options, including converting sites into data centers, the high price of Bitcoin complicates decisions. Byrd estimated a significant power shortfall of over 30 gigawatts by 2028, with solutions like Bloom Energy’s fuel cells and crypto site conversions offering partial relief. However, he warns that connecting new data centers to the grid could take years, and prices for electricity are likely to rise, creating potential political challenges. Other solutions include nuclear power and natural gas turbines, especially in regions like West Texas.

Major U.S. oil companies are considering entering the electricity market by supplying natural gas-powered electricity with carbon capture technologies to meet the growing energy demands of AI data centers. Reuters reported that Chevron has been in talks for over a year to provide natural gas-fired power combined with carbon capture solutions, while Exxon plans to offer low-carbon electricity to data centers by the end of the decade. The move comes as the rise of AI technologies is driving a significant increase in electricity demand, prompting the need for new energy infrastructure. The companies plan to use their expertise in natural gas and carbon capture to help meet this demand, potentially reshaping the power market.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) integrates AI across its products to enhance content creation, marketing, and customer experiences. On December 12, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria reduced Adobe’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) price target from $685 to $625 while maintaining a Buy rating. The company’s Q4 results exceeded expectations, with both revenue and earnings outperforming consensus. Adobe’s management provided positive commentary on AI, although it emphasized that AI monetization is still in its early stages, the firm noted. The company’s FY25 outlook, which implied a revenue growth of around 9%, came in lower than expected. However, the analyst views this guidance as potentially conservative, considering Adobe’s growth opportunities, such as monetizing its value for enterprises and expanding its freemium offerings. Overall, ADBE ranks 1st on our list of trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why Newmont (NEM) Is the Most Promising Gold Stock According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Most Promising Gold Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to look at where Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stands against other most promising gold stocks according to hedge funds. According to a report by the World Gold Council published on December 13, gold is on track for its strongest annual performance in more than a decade, with prices rising 28% year-to-date through November 2024. This surge has been fueled primarily by robust central bank purchases and heightened investor demand. Looking towards 2025, the outlook for gold is shaped by a complex interplay of interest rates, economic growth, and global risks. The US Federal Reserve is expected to implement 100 basis points of rate cuts by year-end, and European central banks may follow suit with similar reductions. These actions are likely to provide a supportive environment for gold. However, potential challenges such as trade wars, rising inflationary pressures, and disruptions to supply chains could weigh on the metal’s performance. The Federal Reserve’s actions will play a central role in determining gold’s direction in 2025. Historically, gold has shown strong gains in the initial phases of rate-cutting cycles, averaging a 6% increase during the first six months. Global economic conditions, particularly in Asia, also play a pivotal role in gold’s demand. China and India, which collectively account for more than 60% of annual gold demand excluding central banks, remain critical to the metal’s long-term prospects. In China, gold demand will hinge on consumer confidence and the broader economic outlook, which may be influenced by government stimulus measures and trade policy developments. India, on the other hand, is already well-positioned with strong economic growth of above 6.5%. Central banks have been net buyers of gold for nearly 15 years, a trend driven by the metal’s role as a long-term store of value and a hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. In 2024, central bank purchases, though slightly below record levels, remained robust, contributing an estimated 7%-10% to gold’s price increase. The report forecasts that central bank demand in 2025 will exceed the long-term average of 500 tonnes, further supporting gold prices. However, a significant slowdown in purchases could introduce downward pressure. In an interview with CNBC on December 3, Ross Beaty, Chair of Equinox Gold Corporation, discussed the current and future prospects of the gold market. Beaty emphasized that all the bullish factors driving the strong performance of gold in 2024 are still intact, including a strong dollar, inflation outlook, and a favorable gold supply. He is optimistic about gold’s performance in 2025, expecting another excellent year for the precious metal. However, Beaty noted a puzzling disconnect between the rising gold prices and the flat or declining performance of gold equities. Beaty, who has been involved in the gold sector for nearly 40 years, said that he has never seen something like this and this anomaly will likely correct itself in 2025. He emphasized that there is no reason why the gold price will decline and that it means there will be a great bull market in gold equities in 2025. Beaty also addressed the potential for further consolidation in the gold mining sector. He highlighted that the mining industry, particularly gold mining, is inherently acquisitive due to the natural decline of mines over time. 2024 saw significant M&A activity in the gold space, and Beaty expects this trend to continue. Investing in gold has long been considered a reliable strategy for preserving wealth and hedging against economic uncertainties. Beyond physical gold, many investors turn to gold stocks, which offer exposure to the precious metal while benefiting from the potential for growth in mining operations and technological advancements. To compile our list of the 12 most promising gold stocks according to hedge funds, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 30 largest companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, or sale of gold. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 12 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 63 Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), founded in 1916 and headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is the largest gold mining company in the world, with operations in multiple countries, including the Americas, Oceania, and Africa. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is actively reshaping its portfolio and organizational structure to drive future growth and enhance shareholder value. Following its 2023 acquisition of Newcrest Mining, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) has embarked on a strategic divestiture program aimed at shedding non-core assets and optimizing its portfolio. As of December 6, notable divestitures include the sale of the Eleonore gold mine in Quebec, the Musselwhite gold mine in Ontario, and the Cripple Creek and Victor gold mine in Colorado, which have collectively brought in over $3.9 billion in gross proceeds. The proceeds from these divestitures will be strategically reinvested to bolster Newmont Corporation’s (NYSE:NEM) core operations and financial health. The company has authorized a $3 billion stock buyback program through October 2026 and has made significant progress in reducing its debt, retiring approximately $500 million in 2024 and aiming to reach a targeted debt balance of $8 billion. On the operational front, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is also streamlining its corporate structure to improve efficiency and effectiveness. On December 9, Bloomberg reported that the company has laid off at least 10 senior managers and plans to merge several business units into three. This restructuring aims to streamline reporting and decision-making processes, reducing overhead costs and enhancing operational agility. Overall, NEM ranks 1st on our list of one of the most promising gold stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NEM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NEM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Oracle Corporation (ORCL) Billionaire David Tepper’s Top Stock Pick Heading into 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire David Tepper’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against other Billionaire David Tepper’s top stock picks heading into 2025. David Tepper is one investor who stands out in squeezing and generating optimum returns from distressed debt and undervalued equities. Born into a middle-class family, he has risen up the ranks to become one of the most successful investors on Wall Street. The billionaire investor started Appaloosa Management LP in 1993 after quitting his job at Goldman Sachs after being overlooked for promotion twice. It is a decision the billionaire investor can never regret, as Appaloosa Management LP has grown to become one of the most followed hedge funds on Wall Street. It had one of its best performances in 2001 when it returned 61% on investing in distressed bonds after the dot com crash. READ ALSO: Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading into 2025 and 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. Additionally, Appaloosa made $7 billion at the height of the great recession in 2009, when it opportunistically bought into distressed financial stocks and bonds. The focus on distressed situations has always defined Tepper. The investment strategy has allowed Tepper to accrue significant wealth, based on his net worth of about $21 billion. His hedge fund has made billions of dollars over the years, averaging 28% returns annually. Tepper is already sensing a window of opportunity with Chinese equities trading at highly discounted valuations in response to deteriorating economic conditions. In the aftermath of the Chinese government initiating a series of stimulus packages to try and prop up the economy, Tepper believes it is time to take a closer look at Chinese equities. “Everything,” Tepper said when asked what Chinese stocks to buy in an interview with CNBC. “Everything… ETFs, I would do futures, everything.” The investment thesis is based on the notion that it is wrong to fight the Fed, which in this case is the Chinese government and the central bank. Tepper’s sentiment comes on China cutting key interest rates and announcing liquidity support for the stock market. China’s central bank has lowered bank reserve requirements and encouraged companies to buy back stocks. Appaloosa Management has already responded to China’s monetary policy changes by tweaking its portfolio. The hedge fund trimmed stakes in some of the big US tech companies whose valuations have exploded over the past year amid the artificial intelligence-driven rides. In return, it has ramped up stakes in Chinese internet giants. “I don’t love the US markets on a value standpoint, but I sure as heck won’t be short, because I’d be nervous as heck of the setup with easing money everywhere, a relatively good economy, and China just doing massive stimulus coming in, so it would make me nervous not to be somewhat long the US,” Tepper said. Amid the sentiments, technology stocks both in the US and China account for the most significant share of billionaire David Tepper’s top 10 stock picks. Additionally, the billionaire investor is heavily invested in the services sector and basic materials as part of his diversification strategy. To compile billionaire David Tepper’s top 10 stock picks heading into 2025, we scanned Appaloosa Management LP’s Q3 ’2024 portfolio. We identified the top ten stocks from the hedge fund’s portfolio. Then, we ranked these stocks in ascending order according to the size of the hedge fund’s investments in them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals meticulously crafting a large-scale enterprise performance management system. Appaloosa Management LP’s Stake Value: $268.11 Million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91 Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is a technology company that offers products and services that address enterprise information environments. As cloud computing has emerged as the foundation of the digital revolution, ORCL has emerged as a significant player in the burgeoning sector. The company boasts a client base that includes Fortune 500 companies, governments, and leading database enterprise companies. Likewise, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence-driven demand for cloud services. Its cloud services growth, AI vision and a shift of database businesses to the cloud affirm why it is one of Billionaire David Tepper’s top 10 stock picks. Its growth metrics and long-term prospects are solid, especially on signing agreements with big three cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet’s Google. Agreements with tech giants open the way for Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) to introduce its services to new customers, strengthening its revenue base. Additionally, the company is expanding and strengthening its business on the international scene. It has partnered with Japan’s NTT Data to expand its cloud capabilities. Its cloud infrastructure is to be integrated into the US Army’s Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army. The strategic partnerships should positively impact Oracle’s growth metrics, allowing it to generate significant shareholder value. Madison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “The top contributors in the quarter were NextEra Energy, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Progressive Corporation, Equifax Inc., and United Healthcare. Oracle reported a strong first quarter with accelerating Cloud infrastructure demand. Oracle followed its solid first quarter with an upbeat analyst meeting which highlighted multi-year growth opportunities for the company.” Overall, ORCL ranks 8th on our list of Billionaire David Tepper’s top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Retail sales, which account for the most significant share of the company’s revenue, were up 6.1% as logistics sales increased 7.9%. Strong performance in specific product categories demonstrates JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD)’s competitive differentiation in the Chinese e-commerce market. The appliance segment’s robust sales have primarily driven the company’s strong third-quarter projections for 2024. The company’s ability to effectively navigate China’s declining consumption has further strengthened its position in the market. Over two years, JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) has increased its net margin from 2.0% to 3.6%, exhibiting sound management and operational fortitude in the face of economic challenges. Ariel Investments stated the following regarding JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “China-based E-commerce company, JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) was the top contributor in the quarter as the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) comprehensive stimulus measures bolstered investor confidence in the Chinese economy. The improving economic sentiment is fueling consumer spending which benefits the company’s retail operations. Additionally, the company’s strategic decision to diversify general merchandise product offerings, expand its third-party marketplace business and monetize advertising streams has contributed to consecutive quarterly earnings beats. JD.com is also poised to capitalize on the home appliance trade-in program, which is one of its largest product categories. Given the favorable market environment, the company’s strategic positioning and supply chain efficiency improvements, we continue to like its long-term growth prospects.” Overall, JD ranks 7th on our list of Billionaire David Tepper’s top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of JD, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Long-Term According to Charles Akre. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against other best stocks to buy for the long-term according to Charles Akre. “Above-average returns at below-average risk” is the mantra that defines Charles Akre, one of the most successful asset managers on Wall Street. As the founder of Akre Capital Management, he is a celebrated value-oriented investor. He is best known as a collector of great business, which he has invested in for many years to generate optimum value. His dedication to long-term planning and systematic valuation has consistently yielded exceptional results. Akre’s investment portfolio has generated more than 300% returns over the past ten years. READ ALSO: Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading into 2025 and 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. He has become one of the most successful investors focusing on an investment philosophy dubbed the “three-legged stool” approach. The investment approach advocates for examining business models’ rates of return and reinvestment opportunities before investing. Likewise, Akre advocates investing in companies with enduring competitive advantages, robust balance sheets, and long-term earnings growth prospects. Unlike most investors focusing on market trends, Akre’s philosophy focuses on finding companies trading at fair value. By avoiding popular stocks, the value investor has succeeded in concentrating on cheap opportunities that most investors often overlook. He also adopts a strategic approach that goes beyond buying and holding stock for the long term. Instead, Akre consistently evaluates the core business strengths and fundamental aspects of companies. His focus on “outstanding businesses” indicates that he has carefully considered factors like competitive advantage, growth potential, and top-notch management. Consequently, the best stocks to buy for the long term, according to Charles Akre, are companies well poised to navigate short-term market fluctuations. Similarly, they are companies that capitalize on long-term compounding effects. In contrast to passive index investing, Akre’s approach necessitates active monitoring of a company’s performance to ensure that it maintains the standards of an exceptional business. Having a thorough understanding of the management team, business operations, and industry dynamics is also essential. The value investor also advocates for diversification as one of the ways of spreading the risk and shrugging off market volatility. Therefore, Akre Capital Management’s portfolio is spread across technology, financial services and other sectors. While the overall market has been trending over the past year, resulting in overstretched valuations, Akre believes there is still value to unlock. Nevertheless, he expects the financial markets to remain volatile. “…The US stock market and quite likely the markets of Western Europe can continue to be very volatile as they respond to good news and bad news, which will pop up on a regular basis. From my perspective, this is actually good news-that kind of volatility will increasingly give us opportunities periodically… Therefore, markets can go up even when economic activity has not picked up. But my expectation is a fair amount of volatility for some time,” said Charles Akre. To compile our selection of the best stocks to buy for the long-term, according to Charles Akre, we began by analyzing Akre Capital Management’s 13F portfolio and chose to highlight the stock holdings that have remained within the portfolio for at least 5 years. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock as of the end of the third quarter of this year. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order based on the value of Charles Akre’s stakes in the companies. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A healthcare professional in a lab coat holding a microscope and looking at a slide under the lens. Akre Capital Management’s First Major Purchase: 2013 Akre Capital Management’s stake value: $493.60 million Number of Hedge fund holders as of Q3: 98 Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is a healthcare company that designs, manufactures, and markets professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services. While the stock has been flat for the year, its diverse portfolio and strategic positioning affirm why it is one of the best stocks to buy for the long term. The company is well-positioned within its sector thanks to its strong portfolio and exposure to diverse geographies and product categories. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)’s operations are spread across several crucial areas, such as bioprocessing, molecular diagnostics, and laboratory equipment. The company’s key bioprocessing business has already returned to growth by impressive third-quarter results delivered on October 22, 2024. Revenues in the quarter were logged in at $5.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and better than the $5.59 billion expected. Earnings per share came in at $1.71, topping consensus estimates of $1.57 a share. During the quarter, the bioprocessing unit bounced to low-single-digit growth. The segment has been under pressure due to destocking from larger clients following the COVID-19 pandemic. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is well poised to generate high single-digit core revenue growth and margin expansion heading into next year. Due to improved operational efficiency, it is also expected to convert 100% of its net income into free cash flow. Here is what Madison Sustainable Equity Fund said about Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) released its 2024 Corporate Sustainability Report. It highlighted several milestones across its three pillars of sustainability (building the best team, innovating products that improve lives and the planet, and protecting the environment). The company has committed to setting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiatives (SBTi), including reaching net-zero value chain emissions by 2050.” Overall, DHR ranks 8th on our list of best stocks to buy for the long-term according to Charles Akre. While we acknowledge the potential of DHR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DHR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Reviewing my 2024 Predictions

Time Published: 2024-12-15T17:15:57Z

For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. –Hosea 8:7 Welp, here we are, at the far end of 2024. I thought I was being overwrought back at the end of 2023, worried about how bad things would be. And now, as 2024 closes out I can only conclude that I am always too optimistic in my takes. Pretty much everything turned out badly and the forecast is for much worse to come. 2024 banner courtesy of our daughter This is, of course, an annual exercise of sorts, so if you are interested in past attempt at predictions or prediction-like things, here is the record as it stands: Now it is time to see how I did for 2024. The rule is that if it doesn’t happen by December 15th, it doesn’t count. (And I had one come to pass on Friday, just two days ahead of the deadline. Go me.) How clear was my vision back at the dawn of the new year? All predictions are worth 10 points unless otherwise noted, with partial credit available for scenarios where a prediction has multiple facets. So what was I thinking about nearly a year ago? 1 – Microsoft Buyers Remorse Everything with Microsoft and XBox was rainbows and lollipops at BlizzCon but, having closed the deal, now MSFT is going to need to deal with the reality. And the reality is that they are going to behave like every other large game studio has been and lay a bunch of people off. Microsoft has already severely trimmed some of its other companies, like LinkedIn, so it will be Blizz next. Granted, there was always going to be some redundancy trimmed, but MSFT will got further and will axe a couple hundred people working on active Blizz projects in 2024 I am going to give myself 10 points here. They slashed 1,900 people before the ink was even dry on this post and cut the unnamed survival game and all the staff working on it. Just another day in the industry where a massive bloodletting was the plan all along. 2 – Activision Settlement Woes Activision Blizzard may have settled with the state of California over harassment and discrimination charges, but they still have a laundry list of changes they have promised to make… and they’ll drag their feet on that until the state has to come after them again. California will need to get in there in order to force compliance with the agreed upon terms before the end of 2024. This was all disappeared into the maw of the Microsoft beast. Once digested it was available for inaccurate regurgitation via Copilot. Zero points. 3 – The War Within Launch Date I am going to put my money on September 9/10 as the world-wide release date for The War Within, and as I usually do, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Well, the general release was August 26/27, so I was off by two weeks, so 6 points for me. 4 – The War Within Reception Fair to middling. Hopes of that the start of this three parter will bestir the fan base and drive people back to retail will… if not fall flat, will be a repeat of Dragonflight. Shadowland killed off retail for too many people and WoW Classic was there to catch them. Retail WoW is a foreign country to many now. It won’t fail or anything, but it will be akin to what we just saw where the launch will generate no “best ever!” press release and they will be giving out free weekends and discounted pricing within a month. The reviews are good for TWW, so that part I did not get. On the flip side, there was no “best ever!” press release about the launch and discounts landed pretty early. I am going to give myself 5 points and declare that WoW Classic has fractured the audience, and never will they be rejoined… until the classic servers catch up to retail I guess. Hoo boy. 5 – Cataclysm Classic Launch Date I am going to put my money on July 15/16 as the world-wide release date for Cataclysm Classic and, as above, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Cata Classic landed in freaking May, so zero points for me on that front. 6 – Pandamonium I don’t think Cataclysm Classic will be the disaster some think it will be, but I also don’t think it is going to hold player attention for as long as Wrath Classic managed. Blizz will announce Mists of Pandaria Classic at BlizzCon and the implication will be that Cata Classic will last less than a year all told. I guess I could fret about the fact that there was no BlizzCon 2024… didn’t predict that… but the substitute, the Warcraft Direct presentation, did announced we would be getting Pandas soon, if not soon enough. 10 points. 7 – Season of Discovery Rug Pull Blizz will get to the end of the vanilla content with Season of Discovery and announce that they will be shutting off the servers because it is over. This will annoy players who were invested in the whole thing or who were still holding out hope for Classic Plus. As with Season of Mastery, when Blizzard uses the word “season” they mean “temporary.” Blizz actually got the memo from the last season server they killed off and declared at the Warcraft Direct that they would not being doing this sort of rug pull. Good for them. Zero points. 8 – Diablo IV Expansion We will get the expected content update in Q2 2024, with May 23/24 being the world wide launch date. The usual “off by weeks” rule above applies. Not even close. Zero points. 9 – Blizz and the Unnamed Survival Title It will remain unnamed and unremarked upon in 2024. Nothing to see here. I have to give myself a big zero points on this one, if only because it was remarked on when Microsoft gave it the axe. 10 – World of Warcraft Celebrates 20 Years World of Warcraft will hit its 20 year anniversary in November. As such, I am going to throw out a few bullet points, worth five points each, should they come to pass. That is a possible 35 points in play. Is Classic Classic a new flavor? I am going to say yes, which gives me 20 points. 11 – The Year of EverQuest The Norrath titles, EverQuest and EverQuest II, are turning 25 and 20 respectively in 2024. As such, Daybreak will have some big plans or some such. No doubt the EverQuest II anniversary will be overshadowed by WoW, but it will still be a thing. As above, I am going to throw out some bullet points that are worth five points each should they come to pass. That is a possible 30 points in play, but I only managed 15 points on this one. 12 – Daybreak Un-Announcements Last year we got low key announcements that there were H1Z1 and EverQuest titles in the offing. My guess is that Daybreak is going to walk one of those back, either removing it from their plans entirely or pushing back any previously planned dates by at least two years. And you know what, I am going to demand double points if they do it for both. How do you like them apples? Well, I get zero points because they did neither. Both were mentioned, but only in the vaguest possible terms. 13 – LOTRO No Closer to 4K Support Meanwhile, over at the Standing Stone group at Daybreak, they are going to potter merrily along with content updates and cash shop items and they are not going to do one thing to further the cause of 4K video support for the game. After seven years of “we’ll get to it” I view this as a gimme, a free ten points, and I dare SSG to prove me wrong! As expected, an absolute gimme. This is nowhere on their roadmap and seems unlikely ever to come to pass. 10 points. 14 – Consoles for Some but not All In 2024 DC Universe Online will become a native PlayStation 5 application… and PlanetSide 2 will not. Oh, and it goes without saying that the idea of LOTRO on consoles will never be mentioned again by Daybreak/EG7… but I said it anyway! I’ll even give myself NEGATIVE ten points if LOTRO on consoles is mentioned in any way save for announcing it won’t happen. That should offset #12. As expected DCUO, the gross revenue champion at Daybreak, went live on the PlayStation 5 as a native app… and PlanetSide 2 got… um… moved to Frogman? And nobody said nuttin’ about no LOTRO on consoles. A dead idea. 10 points for me. 15 – EVE Online Expansion Dreams CCP, having tasted success from three Faction Warfare expansions in a row will roll the dice on that again for its mid-year expansion, but that will fail to keep the proverbial summer slump from hitting the way Viridian prevented it. No, they came for null sec this time with Equinox. While online numbers were not down to pre-Havoc levels, there was still a bit of a summer slump. So, maybe 2 points for me on that. 16 – EVE Vanguard Launch Date I don’t know when it will officially be live, but it won’t be in 2024. There will be more live tests and some form of early access, but it will still be in the gray zone between testing and a live launch come the end of the year. I am going to give myself half credit it it does fully launch in 2024, but not until November and eight points if it lands in December. In mid-November they were saying EVE Vanguard was “Still in early development” in official announcements. I am prepared to re-roll this prediction for 2025. 10 points. 17 – EVE Galaxy Conquest’s Fate The new mobile title announced at Fanfest, EVE Galaxy Conquest, will launch then fade so fast in the sea of mobile titles out there that the promise of a PC version will never come to pass. That will be a shame, because EVE Online has an older demographic that would really dig into a strategic, 4x PC title set in New Eden. Half credit if it doesn’t launch at all in 2024. It did launch, I did try it, it did fail to impress, so I am going to give myself 10 points and dare anybody to prove me wrong. The proverbial stone in the pond that left not a ripple. 18 – EVE War for New Eden The EVE Online board game. I feel this was announced prematurely. There was no benefit from breaking that news before Fanfest unless the Kickstarter was ready to go. And given the dearth of information available so far, I am going to predict that the Kickstarter won’t go live before June 1st and if you pledge to get a copy it won’t arrive in time for Christmas. Well, the Kickstarter campaign was off and running well before June 1st, but there looks to be no sign of shipping by Christmas. 5 points. 19 – Project Awakening It won’t ship in 2024, but we will get a preview and it will be a weakly revamped version of EVE Online that puts all in game items on the blockchain and will feature a new currency that a16z will own. The only people who will be excited by this are people invested in blockchain because this will be entirely about that technology and not at all about game play. (Which is the perennial fault of all of these crypto projects. Also, play to earn is a garbage idea and will never succeed in the long term, being a completely untenable economic idea.) As with EVE: Galaxy Conquest, I am going to claim full credit because what little CCP has shared has all been cope and BS. Bad idea was bad. 10 points. 20 – Camelot Unhinged It is always an easy one, predicting that Camelot Unchained won’t ship. It has been good for almost a decade. (Beta 1 access, promised for February 2015, still not a thing.) So let’s dial that up a notch. Not only will it not ship in 2024, it also won’t be available for any sort of general access beta for backers (staged, one weekend, events don’t count), and Marc Jacobs is going to announce a THIRD title his team is working on. Two out of three isn’t bad, considering I was pretty much making up that third one as a dare to the universe. I will take 6 points (didn’t ship, not general access for backers) and be on my way. 21 – Starved Citizen Chris Roberts will stumble this year, announcing something that will end up being a step too far for all but his most die hard adherents. Second and third quarter revenues will fall short by year over year measures. But then he’ll announce some crazy new feature at CitizenCon… zero G sex or a psychedelic asteroid mining colony option or maybe actual in game psychedelics… and things will recover in the fourth quarter. Depending heavily on The Nosy Gamer to keep me honest on this one with his reporting. I don’t even know why I made this prediction, I don’t care enough about it to even pay attention. Zero points unless somebody tells me I was on to something in the comments. 22 – Pantheon Something Something Something Visionary Realms will make a huge mistake and ship something this year. I say “mistake” because they have managed to survive on selling vision… hey, it is literally in their name… but when the rubber finally hits the road… oh my. It might only be early access to Pantheon, but it will be generally available and the reaction will be muted and panic will set in at the company as they find out that nostalgia has problems interacting with reality. December early access on a somewhat bland offering. I get at least 5 points for that… mostly because it launched two days ago so panic hasn’t had time to hit. 23 – Random Shot at Ubisoft Just because I’ve set some personal record for grudges against a company when it comes to Ubisoft… a record achieved largely by them renewing my ire pretty much annually. So Ubisoft will do something in 2024 that will enrage players/fans/gamers or whoever and I will renew my vow to never buy another game from them again. Also, water will be wet and the sun will continue to rise in the east. I was kind of worried about this one because it would require me to pay some attention to Ubisoft, which I generally only do under duress. But then their CEO called Skull & Bones a four-A game (that is one A better than triple-A right?) to justify its price point and I was annoyed and then gave myself 10 points. And then more stuff happened that would have counted. This was even more of a gimme than I expected it would be. 24 – Metaversary Stories In the smoking remains of the metaverse hype of 2022, here is how the few remaining contenders will fare in 2024. Each bullet point is worth 5 points. 25 points total in play here. Man, Zuck is still pouring money into Horizon Worlds. Unbelievable. The team is clearly in panic mode and it won’t last forever, but it lasted until December 15th. 0 points If Decentraland shut down would anybody even notice? Can you prove it is still there? Is it even worth the effort? It isn’t worth the points for me to find out. 0 points. Playable Worlds delivered some design philosophy… and then some pre-Alpha stuff for testers to work with… with only a partial NDA. Better than Mark Jacobs has managed. 0 points. I mean, there are no VentureBeat headlines about the metaverse anymore, those being all about AI this year. But they still put out a weekly newsletter about it. That is worth at least 1 point. Finally, no coherent definition was kind of a gimme, so gimme my 5 points. 25 – Virtual Banality Virtual Reality will remain a niche market, giving lie to all those optimistic growth charts of the last dozen years, with sales of VR hardware actually declining in 2024. There is so much obfuscation on this that I cannot, in good faith, give myself full points. To start with, 2024 isn’t done yet. But, also, I can find contradictory charts and forecasts claiming sales have been both up or maybe down after peaking in 2021. But it is still a niche market, so I am taking 1 point for that with a promise not to make a prediction like this again next year. 26 – Pokemon Go to the Moon! Pokemon Go will release an update that will increase the level cap to 60, with the experience point gap between 59 and 60 being ONE BILLION. This will be the classic blunder of hurting all the normies… I friend online so many casual players on community days that are mid-30s to low-40s… because a tiny percentage of the player base hit 50 too quickly. The rumors proved false. Pokemon Go introduced a few new updates, but no level cap increase. Zero points. 27 – Destination Steam The following Blizzard titles will end up on Steam in 2024. Five points per correct guess. 25 points in play here… and zero points earned. Got soaked on that one I guess. 28 – Destination XBox The following Blizzard titles will end up in the XBox PC store… not necessarily on Game Pass, but available for purchase or subscription through Microsoft’s XBox store front for your PC. 30 points in play here, and I am good for 20 points out of that list, with the titles in bold available. I was dumb to add the others since they don’t have an upfront box cost. 29 – Pax Dei Pax Dei will end up reneging on their “no NPCs” plan once they get into early access… so I guess part of this prediction is that they will get to early access this year… because somebody will recall how hard CCP had to work to bootstrap a player economy into existence even with NPCs as part of their plan. Their player run sandbox idea will shamble along until they do this. Another game I thought I might pay attention to. No chance. But their FAQ still says no NPCs. I am not sure why I cared enough to make this prediction now. Zero points. 30 – Tarislandia While some members of the gaming press have been falling all over themselves to dismiss Tarisland a WoW clone, even idiotically suggesting it somehow sprang fully formed into existence when WoW lost its partner in China… those diabolical Chinese planned it this way all along… when it finally ships this year… there is part of the prediction… people will change their tune and will declare it is more of a Lost Ark clone… or anything besides being the cheap copy of WoW that it was so aggressively painted as in the press. I fear this prediction suffers greatly from the phenomena I refer to as “nobody gives a shit.” If you insist it is a WoW clone, then pretty much any fantasy MMORPG launched after WoW fits the bill. And if it isn’t… I don’t know, what is a WoW clone anyway? I’m going to give myself 1 point for even caring enough to write that much about it. 31 – Just Won’t Ship As the heading says, these titles won’t ship in 2024. For purposes of this prediction, remaining in alpha or beta means the ship metric was not met, but I am going to say that paid early access counts as shipping, because screw anybody who tries to take money AND deflect issues. This is five points per bullet point. 40 points overall on that one. Bonus Predictions These are the crazy fringe guesses that have no basis in reality, but I get 10 additional points if one of them actually comes to pass. Richard “Lord British” Garriott will announce that his blockchain shambles of a project will be driven by AI, because that buzzword is still active and must remain active until he jumps on the bandwagon, which is always the sign that the gold rush is over and we need to move on. No, but he is once again claiming that through some magic he will once again gain control of Ultima Online or the Ultima franchise or some deluded fart sniffing BS. What would he even do with it if he got it? Why does he have to try to be relevant while completely failing to be relevant? Zero points. That third title that City State Entertainment announces in 2024 will be blockchain driven because Mark Jacobs will have been offered a wad of money, the way CCP has, to make a title using the technology. It will be the final sell out and he will never ship another game in his lifetime. I mean, I think the last sentence is still likely correct, and that includes the as yet unshipped Camelot Unchained. But he lives yet, so zero points. Peter Molyneux’s Project MOAT will be announced as a blockchain, AI driven, multiverse vision… if it isn’t all that already. I cannot be bothered to check. I have just seen a few headlines, which is more than it deserves. This almost seems like a gimme at this point in his career. I am hoping Conner at MMO Fallout will keep me honest here. Molyneaux has been surprisingly contrite and grounded this year… I mean, relative to past behavior, to be fair… so he hasn’t sparked much outrage that I have seen. Certainly not blockchain levels of outrage. Zero points. Somebody will notice that CCP’s promise that its skill point packs are “once per account” is meaningless when they just change up the packs every month or so, meaning that there is effectively no limit over time. I will deduct zero points if I am the source of this discovery. I am allowed to set fires too! This probably only mattered to me… and it did not even matter to me really. CCP sells skill points. CCP hands skill points out like candy. Skill points aren’t a story anymore… unless you don’t have enough to fit that new hull you bought. Zero points and zero interest from anybody. I feel like I could do a whole Twitter predictions post, but I am going to just predict that Elon is going to loudly threaten bankruptcy by the end of 2024 to keep creditors at bay. Muskovites have been smug about him having those foolish enough to finance the deal by the balls following the old saw about “Borrow a thousand dollars and the bank owns, borrow a billion dollars and you own the bank,” but Musk put up Tesla stock as collateral and if he isn’t making his payments they can declare default and take the stock. Musk won’t like that, and bankruptcy won’t stop it in the long term, but the mention of bankruptcy will introduce delay and chaos, which is all he’ll want out of it. He won’t actually declare bankruptcy since he is convinced that would make his penis shrink further. He jumped fully on board the Trump train and ended up a made man… or clown… or whatever he is. I should be happy I didn’t do any other Twitter predictions as I was clearly too optimistic. Zero points, despite what a clown he is. All of that added up to a possible total 450 points, plus a potential 50 bonus points for wild ass guesses… none of which panned out, so we can discard those. Out of that, I count a total of 212 points awarded by me to myself, which makes me about a 47% correct on predictions… which is honestly a lot better than I usually do. I think my past peak was 43%, while I am usually down in the 20% range. I guess my favorite quote it true. Always predict the worst and you’ll be hailed as a prophet. -Tom Lehrer, quoting a friend Now what will I see when looking forward into 2025? Can I manage it? Can I bear it? I always enjoy these posts, coming and going. This one is intersting for how many gaming-related things that seemed important a year ago seem completely irrelevant now. Tarisland? We cared about that? The Metaverse? Does anyone remember it? Pantheon is still interesting, though. I wonder what counts as “success” there? It’s nice that they’re on Steam because we get hard numbers and for an indie project they aren’t that bad at this very early stage: a couple of thousand people playing concurrently and that number slightly rising still. And the game is available directly through Visionary Realms, of course, so maybe they have double that, which by the old 3x rule means something like 10-12k players, which could be viable, always assuming they have a way to get more money out of them. I suspect they might end up with a low-end, sustainable MMORPG, which puts them a long way ahead of many of their erstwhile behind-closed-doors competitors. Camelot Unchained is just a fever dream now, isn’t it? LikeLiked by 1 person I was thinking that last night, about how much this post is a reflection of my state of mind related the meta of the industry and video games in general. But I also think I have said something along those lines in the past, that these are less about being right and more about what is going on in my head. I’ve also never quite decided if my being correct is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, in two weeks or so you can see what is what in my brain once more. Camelot Unchained… I don’t even know what it is now. The team, as I have noted in the past, write bubbling happy updates every month about how great everything is going as though they have a live game in production and not just a bunch of code… one assumes there is some code out there somewhere… that no end user has ever been allowed to play. It is bordering on North Korea levels of propaganda. LikeLike Oh, I laughed at the Star Citizen predictions because on the financial side you got almost everything wrong. For the second and third quarters sales were up 13% each quarter. And while you were right about Roberts announcing something crazy at CitizenCon, CIG needs $11 million in the next 2 weeks to match Q4 2023 and $8.5 million to match last year’s total. Not happening. If all the blockchain/crypto stuff weren’t happening, I’d ask if your faith in humanity was restored. LikeLike Classic catching up to live would mean a shadowlands classic…. ugh and I thought cats classic would be bad. LikeLike IKR? That is where I got off the retail bus the first time around. Maybe if they could keep it to under a year and I could just get to level cap and ignore the insane Toghast grind. But, given how Cata Classic has gone, the won’t want us to miss a beat of the classic Shadowlands experience. But at the current rate of rolling classic forward we have a few years before it becomes an issue. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Reviewing my 2024 Predictions

For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. –Hosea 8:7 Welp, here we are, at the far end of 2024. I thought I was being overwrought back at the end of 2023, worried about how bad things would be. And now, as 2024 closes out I can only conclude that I am always too optimistic in my takes. Pretty much everything turned out badly and the forecast is for much worse to come. 2024 banner courtesy of our daughter This is, of course, an annual exercise of sorts, so if you are interested in past attempt at predictions or prediction-like things, here is the record as it stands: Now it is time to see how I did for 2024. The rule is that if it doesn’t happen by December 15th, it doesn’t count. (And I had one come to pass on Friday, just two days ahead of the deadline. Go me.) How clear was my vision back at the dawn of the new year? All predictions are worth 10 points unless otherwise noted, with partial credit available for scenarios where a prediction has multiple facets. So what was I thinking about nearly a year ago? 1 – Microsoft Buyers Remorse Everything with Microsoft and XBox was rainbows and lollipops at BlizzCon but, having closed the deal, now MSFT is going to need to deal with the reality. And the reality is that they are going to behave like every other large game studio has been and lay a bunch of people off. Microsoft has already severely trimmed some of its other companies, like LinkedIn, so it will be Blizz next. Granted, there was always going to be some redundancy trimmed, but MSFT will got further and will axe a couple hundred people working on active Blizz projects in 2024 I am going to give myself 10 points here. They slashed 1,900 people before the ink was even dry on this post and cut the unnamed survival game and all the staff working on it. Just another day in the industry where a massive bloodletting was the plan all along. 2 – Activision Settlement Woes Activision Blizzard may have settled with the state of California over harassment and discrimination charges, but they still have a laundry list of changes they have promised to make… and they’ll drag their feet on that until the state has to come after them again. California will need to get in there in order to force compliance with the agreed upon terms before the end of 2024. This was all disappeared into the maw of the Microsoft beast. Once digested it was available for inaccurate regurgitation via Copilot. Zero points. 3 – The War Within Launch Date I am going to put my money on September 9/10 as the world-wide release date for The War Within, and as I usually do, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Well, the general release was August 26/27, so I was off by two weeks, so 6 points for me. 4 – The War Within Reception Fair to middling. Hopes of that the start of this three parter will bestir the fan base and drive people back to retail will… if not fall flat, will be a repeat of Dragonflight. Shadowland killed off retail for too many people and WoW Classic was there to catch them. Retail WoW is a foreign country to many now. It won’t fail or anything, but it will be akin to what we just saw where the launch will generate no “best ever!” press release and they will be giving out free weekends and discounted pricing within a month. The reviews are good for TWW, so that part I did not get. On the flip side, there was no “best ever!” press release about the launch and discounts landed pretty early. I am going to give myself 5 points and declare that WoW Classic has fractured the audience, and never will they be rejoined… until the classic servers catch up to retail I guess. Hoo boy. 5 – Cataclysm Classic Launch Date I am going to put my money on July 15/16 as the world-wide release date for Cataclysm Classic and, as above, the accounting for points will be minus two for every week off I am. Cata Classic landed in freaking May, so zero points for me on that front. 6 – Pandamonium I don’t think Cataclysm Classic will be the disaster some think it will be, but I also don’t think it is going to hold player attention for as long as Wrath Classic managed. Blizz will announce Mists of Pandaria Classic at BlizzCon and the implication will be that Cata Classic will last less than a year all told. I guess I could fret about the fact that there was no BlizzCon 2024… didn’t predict that… but the substitute, the Warcraft Direct presentation, did announced we would be getting Pandas soon, if not soon enough. 10 points. 7 – Season of Discovery Rug Pull Blizz will get to the end of the vanilla content with Season of Discovery and announce that they will be shutting off the servers because it is over. This will annoy players who were invested in the whole thing or who were still holding out hope for Classic Plus. As with Season of Mastery, when Blizzard uses the word “season” they mean “temporary.” Blizz actually got the memo from the last season server they killed off and declared at the Warcraft Direct that they would not being doing this sort of rug pull. Good for them. Zero points. 8 – Diablo IV Expansion We will get the expected content update in Q2 2024, with May 23/24 being the world wide launch date. The usual “off by weeks” rule above applies. Not even close. Zero points. 9 – Blizz and the Unnamed Survival Title It will remain unnamed and unremarked upon in 2024. Nothing to see here. I have to give myself a big zero points on this one, if only because it was remarked on when Microsoft gave it the axe. 10 – World of Warcraft Celebrates 20 Years World of Warcraft will hit its 20 year anniversary in November. As such, I am going to throw out a few bullet points, worth five points each, should they come to pass. That is a possible 35 points in play. Is Classic Classic a new flavor? I am going to say yes, which gives me 20 points. 11 – The Year of EverQuest The Norrath titles, EverQuest and EverQuest II, are turning 25 and 20 respectively in 2024. As such, Daybreak will have some big plans or some such. No doubt the EverQuest II anniversary will be overshadowed by WoW, but it will still be a thing. As above, I am going to throw out some bullet points that are worth five points each should they come to pass. That is a possible 30 points in play, but I only managed 15 points on this one. 12 – Daybreak Un-Announcements Last year we got low key announcements that there were H1Z1 and EverQuest titles in the offing. My guess is that Daybreak is going to walk one of those back, either removing it from their plans entirely or pushing back any previously planned dates by at least two years. And you know what, I am going to demand double points if they do it for both. How do you like them apples? Well, I get zero points because they did neither. Both were mentioned, but only in the vaguest possible terms. 13 – LOTRO No Closer to 4K Support Meanwhile, over at the Standing Stone group at Daybreak, they are going to potter merrily along with content updates and cash shop items and they are not going to do one thing to further the cause of 4K video support for the game. After seven years of “we’ll get to it” I view this as a gimme, a free ten points, and I dare SSG to prove me wrong! As expected, an absolute gimme. This is nowhere on their roadmap and seems unlikely ever to come to pass. 10 points. 14 – Consoles for Some but not All In 2024 DC Universe Online will become a native PlayStation 5 application… and PlanetSide 2 will not. Oh, and it goes without saying that the idea of LOTRO on consoles will never be mentioned again by Daybreak/EG7… but I said it anyway! I’ll even give myself NEGATIVE ten points if LOTRO on consoles is mentioned in any way save for announcing it won’t happen. That should offset #12. As expected DCUO, the gross revenue champion at Daybreak, went live on the PlayStation 5 as a native app… and PlanetSide 2 got… um… moved to Frogman? And nobody said nuttin’ about no LOTRO on consoles. A dead idea. 10 points for me. 15 – EVE Online Expansion Dreams CCP, having tasted success from three Faction Warfare expansions in a row will roll the dice on that again for its mid-year expansion, but that will fail to keep the proverbial summer slump from hitting the way Viridian prevented it. No, they came for null sec this time with Equinox. While online numbers were not down to pre-Havoc levels, there was still a bit of a summer slump. So, maybe 2 points for me on that. 16 – EVE Vanguard Launch Date I don’t know when it will officially be live, but it won’t be in 2024. There will be more live tests and some form of early access, but it will still be in the gray zone between testing and a live launch come the end of the year. I am going to give myself half credit it it does fully launch in 2024, but not until November and eight points if it lands in December. In mid-November they were saying EVE Vanguard was “Still in early development” in official announcements. I am prepared to re-roll this prediction for 2025. 10 points. 17 – EVE Galaxy Conquest’s Fate The new mobile title announced at Fanfest, EVE Galaxy Conquest, will launch then fade so fast in the sea of mobile titles out there that the promise of a PC version will never come to pass. That will be a shame, because EVE Online has an older demographic that would really dig into a strategic, 4x PC title set in New Eden. Half credit if it doesn’t launch at all in 2024. It did launch, I did try it, it did fail to impress, so I am going to give myself 10 points and dare anybody to prove me wrong. The proverbial stone in the pond that left not a ripple. 18 – EVE War for New Eden The EVE Online board game. I feel this was announced prematurely. There was no benefit from breaking that news before Fanfest unless the Kickstarter was ready to go. And given the dearth of information available so far, I am going to predict that the Kickstarter won’t go live before June 1st and if you pledge to get a copy it won’t arrive in time for Christmas. Well, the Kickstarter campaign was off and running well before June 1st, but there looks to be no sign of shipping by Christmas. 5 points. 19 – Project Awakening It won’t ship in 2024, but we will get a preview and it will be a weakly revamped version of EVE Online that puts all in game items on the blockchain and will feature a new currency that a16z will own. The only people who will be excited by this are people invested in blockchain because this will be entirely about that technology and not at all about game play. (Which is the perennial fault of all of these crypto projects. Also, play to earn is a garbage idea and will never succeed in the long term, being a completely untenable economic idea.) As with EVE: Galaxy Conquest, I am going to claim full credit because what little CCP has shared has all been cope and BS. Bad idea was bad. 10 points. 20 – Camelot Unhinged It is always an easy one, predicting that Camelot Unchained won’t ship. It has been good for almost a decade. (Beta 1 access, promised for February 2015, still not a thing.) So let’s dial that up a notch. Not only will it not ship in 2024, it also won’t be available for any sort of general access beta for backers (staged, one weekend, events don’t count), and Marc Jacobs is going to announce a THIRD title his team is working on. Two out of three isn’t bad, considering I was pretty much making up that third one as a dare to the universe. I will take 6 points (didn’t ship, not general access for backers) and be on my way. 21 – Starved Citizen Chris Roberts will stumble this year, announcing something that will end up being a step too far for all but his most die hard adherents. Second and third quarter revenues will fall short by year over year measures. But then he’ll announce some crazy new feature at CitizenCon… zero G sex or a psychedelic asteroid mining colony option or maybe actual in game psychedelics… and things will recover in the fourth quarter. Depending heavily on The Nosy Gamer to keep me honest on this one with his reporting. I don’t even know why I made this prediction, I don’t care enough about it to even pay attention. Zero points unless somebody tells me I was on to something in the comments. 22 – Pantheon Something Something Something Visionary Realms will make a huge mistake and ship something this year. I say “mistake” because they have managed to survive on selling vision… hey, it is literally in their name… but when the rubber finally hits the road… oh my. It might only be early access to Pantheon, but it will be generally available and the reaction will be muted and panic will set in at the company as they find out that nostalgia has problems interacting with reality. December early access on a somewhat bland offering. I get at least 5 points for that… mostly because it launched two days ago so panic hasn’t had time to hit. 23 – Random Shot at Ubisoft Just because I’ve set some personal record for grudges against a company when it comes to Ubisoft… a record achieved largely by them renewing my ire pretty much annually. So Ubisoft will do something in 2024 that will enrage players/fans/gamers or whoever and I will renew my vow to never buy another game from them again. Also, water will be wet and the sun will continue to rise in the east. I was kind of worried about this one because it would require me to pay some attention to Ubisoft, which I generally only do under duress. But then their CEO called Skull & Bones a four-A game (that is one A better than triple-A right?) to justify its price point and I was annoyed and then gave myself 10 points. And then more stuff happened that would have counted. This was even more of a gimme than I expected it would be. 24 – Metaversary Stories In the smoking remains of the metaverse hype of 2022, here is how the few remaining contenders will fare in 2024. Each bullet point is worth 5 points. 25 points total in play here. Man, Zuck is still pouring money into Horizon Worlds. Unbelievable. The team is clearly in panic mode and it won’t last forever, but it lasted until December 15th. 0 points If Decentraland shut down would anybody even notice? Can you prove it is still there? Is it even worth the effort? It isn’t worth the points for me to find out. 0 points. Playable Worlds delivered some design philosophy… and then some pre-Alpha stuff for testers to work with… with only a partial NDA. Better than Mark Jacobs has managed. 0 points. I mean, there are no VentureBeat headlines about the metaverse anymore, those being all about AI this year. But they still put out a weekly newsletter about it. That is worth at least 1 point. Finally, no coherent definition was kind of a gimme, so gimme my 5 points. 25 – Virtual Banality Virtual Reality will remain a niche market, giving lie to all those optimistic growth charts of the last dozen years, with sales of VR hardware actually declining in 2024. There is so much obfuscation on this that I cannot, in good faith, give myself full points. To start with, 2024 isn’t done yet. But, also, I can find contradictory charts and forecasts claiming sales have been both up or maybe down after peaking in 2021. But it is still a niche market, so I am taking 1 point for that with a promise not to make a prediction like this again next year. 26 – Pokemon Go to the Moon! Pokemon Go will release an update that will increase the level cap to 60, with the experience point gap between 59 and 60 being ONE BILLION. This will be the classic blunder of hurting all the normies… I friend online so many casual players on community days that are mid-30s to low-40s… because a tiny percentage of the player base hit 50 too quickly. The rumors proved false. Pokemon Go introduced a few new updates, but no level cap increase. Zero points. 27 – Destination Steam The following Blizzard titles will end up on Steam in 2024. Five points per correct guess. 25 points in play here… and zero points earned. Got soaked on that one I guess. 28 – Destination XBox The following Blizzard titles will end up in the XBox PC store… not necessarily on Game Pass, but available for purchase or subscription through Microsoft’s XBox store front for your PC. 30 points in play here, and I am good for 20 points out of that list, with the titles in bold available. I was dumb to add the others since they don’t have an upfront box cost. 29 – Pax Dei Pax Dei will end up reneging on their “no NPCs” plan once they get into early access… so I guess part of this prediction is that they will get to early access this year… because somebody will recall how hard CCP had to work to bootstrap a player economy into existence even with NPCs as part of their plan. Their player run sandbox idea will shamble along until they do this. Another game I thought I might pay attention to. No chance. But their FAQ still says no NPCs. I am not sure why I cared enough to make this prediction now. Zero points. 30 – Tarislandia While some members of the gaming press have been falling all over themselves to dismiss Tarisland a WoW clone, even idiotically suggesting it somehow sprang fully formed into existence when WoW lost its partner in China… those diabolical Chinese planned it this way all along… when it finally ships this year… there is part of the prediction… people will change their tune and will declare it is more of a Lost Ark clone… or anything besides being the cheap copy of WoW that it was so aggressively painted as in the press. I fear this prediction suffers greatly from the phenomena I refer to as “nobody gives a shit.” If you insist it is a WoW clone, then pretty much any fantasy MMORPG launched after WoW fits the bill. And if it isn’t… I don’t know, what is a WoW clone anyway? I’m going to give myself 1 point for even caring enough to write that much about it. 31 – Just Won’t Ship As the heading says, these titles won’t ship in 2024. For purposes of this prediction, remaining in alpha or beta means the ship metric was not met, but I am going to say that paid early access counts as shipping, because screw anybody who tries to take money AND deflect issues. This is five points per bullet point. 40 points overall on that one. Bonus Predictions These are the crazy fringe guesses that have no basis in reality, but I get 10 additional points if one of them actually comes to pass. Richard “Lord British” Garriott will announce that his blockchain shambles of a project will be driven by AI, because that buzzword is still active and must remain active until he jumps on the bandwagon, which is always the sign that the gold rush is over and we need to move on. No, but he is once again claiming that through some magic he will once again gain control of Ultima Online or the Ultima franchise or some deluded fart sniffing BS. What would he even do with it if he got it? Why does he have to try to be relevant while completely failing to be relevant? Zero points. That third title that City State Entertainment announces in 2024 will be blockchain driven because Mark Jacobs will have been offered a wad of money, the way CCP has, to make a title using the technology. It will be the final sell out and he will never ship another game in his lifetime. I mean, I think the last sentence is still likely correct, and that includes the as yet unshipped Camelot Unchained. But he lives yet, so zero points. Peter Molyneux’s Project MOAT will be announced as a blockchain, AI driven, multiverse vision… if it isn’t all that already. I cannot be bothered to check. I have just seen a few headlines, which is more than it deserves. This almost seems like a gimme at this point in his career. I am hoping Conner at MMO Fallout will keep me honest here. Molyneaux has been surprisingly contrite and grounded this year… I mean, relative to past behavior, to be fair… so he hasn’t sparked much outrage that I have seen. Certainly not blockchain levels of outrage. Zero points. Somebody will notice that CCP’s promise that its skill point packs are “once per account” is meaningless when they just change up the packs every month or so, meaning that there is effectively no limit over time. I will deduct zero points if I am the source of this discovery. I am allowed to set fires too! This probably only mattered to me… and it did not even matter to me really. CCP sells skill points. CCP hands skill points out like candy. Skill points aren’t a story anymore… unless you don’t have enough to fit that new hull you bought. Zero points and zero interest from anybody. I feel like I could do a whole Twitter predictions post, but I am going to just predict that Elon is going to loudly threaten bankruptcy by the end of 2024 to keep creditors at bay. Muskovites have been smug about him having those foolish enough to finance the deal by the balls following the old saw about “Borrow a thousand dollars and the bank owns, borrow a billion dollars and you own the bank,” but Musk put up Tesla stock as collateral and if he isn’t making his payments they can declare default and take the stock. Musk won’t like that, and bankruptcy won’t stop it in the long term, but the mention of bankruptcy will introduce delay and chaos, which is all he’ll want out of it. He won’t actually declare bankruptcy since he is convinced that would make his penis shrink further. He jumped fully on board the Trump train and ended up a made man… or clown… or whatever he is. I should be happy I didn’t do any other Twitter predictions as I was clearly too optimistic. Zero points, despite what a clown he is. All of that added up to a possible total 450 points, plus a potential 50 bonus points for wild ass guesses… none of which panned out, so we can discard those. Out of that, I count a total of 212 points awarded by me to myself, which makes me about a 47% correct on predictions… which is honestly a lot better than I usually do. I think my past peak was 43%, while I am usually down in the 20% range. I guess my favorite quote it true. Always predict the worst and you’ll be hailed as a prophet. -Tom Lehrer, quoting a friend Now what will I see when looking forward into 2025? Can I manage it? Can I bear it? I always enjoy these posts, coming and going. This one is intersting for how many gaming-related things that seemed important a year ago seem completely irrelevant now. Tarisland? We cared about that? The Metaverse? Does anyone remember it? Pantheon is still interesting, though. I wonder what counts as “success” there? It’s nice that they’re on Steam because we get hard numbers and for an indie project they aren’t that bad at this very early stage: a couple of thousand people playing concurrently and that number slightly rising still. And the game is available directly through Visionary Realms, of course, so maybe they have double that, which by the old 3x rule means something like 10-12k players, which could be viable, always assuming they have a way to get more money out of them. I suspect they might end up with a low-end, sustainable MMORPG, which puts them a long way ahead of many of their erstwhile behind-closed-doors competitors. Camelot Unchained is just a fever dream now, isn’t it? LikeLiked by 1 person I was thinking that last night, about how much this post is a reflection of my state of mind related the meta of the industry and video games in general. But I also think I have said something along those lines in the past, that these are less about being right and more about what is going on in my head. I’ve also never quite decided if my being correct is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, in two weeks or so you can see what is what in my brain once more. Camelot Unchained… I don’t even know what it is now. The team, as I have noted in the past, write bubbling happy updates every month about how great everything is going as though they have a live game in production and not just a bunch of code… one assumes there is some code out there somewhere… that no end user has ever been allowed to play. It is bordering on North Korea levels of propaganda. LikeLike Oh, I laughed at the Star Citizen predictions because on the financial side you got almost everything wrong. For the second and third quarters sales were up 13% each quarter. And while you were right about Roberts announcing something crazy at CitizenCon, CIG needs $11 million in the next 2 weeks to match Q4 2023 and $8.5 million to match last year’s total. Not happening. If all the blockchain/crypto stuff weren’t happening, I’d ask if your faith in humanity was restored. LikeLike Classic catching up to live would mean a shadowlands classic…. ugh and I thought cats classic would be bad. LikeLike IKR? That is where I got off the retail bus the first time around. Maybe if they could keep it to under a year and I could just get to level cap and ignore the insane Toghast grind. But, given how Cata Classic has gone, the won’t want us to miss a beat of the classic Shadowlands experience. But at the current rate of rolling classic forward we have a few years before it becomes an issue. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: How AI energy demand in 2025 will put natural gas in the spotlight

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Natural gas (NG=F) prices are on track to close out the year in negative territory. But there's optimism for 2025, largely because of exports and more demand stemming from artificial intelligence. "We’re constructive on power, and because we’re constructive on power, we think natural gas is going to perform well," said Francisco Blanch, head of Bank of America's global commodities and derivatives research, during a recent energy outlook roundtable. Natural gas prices are down 13% year to date, largely because of milder winters and a supply glut. But industry watchers are betting on increasing gas exports and greater power demand from the on-shoring of manufacturing facilities and AI data centers. "These ... centers have to run 24/7," BofA's Blanch said. Power demand for data centers is expected to grow between 10% and 15% per year between now and 2030 — and that could account for up to 5% of total worldwide power demand by 2030. "[Natural gas] will allow the infrastructure to be built and let it power the generation plants to make electricity," Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, told Yahoo Finance. "Natural gas will be the fuel of the future," he added. Case in point: Energy equipment maker and servicing company GE Vernova (GEV) recently raised its projections for its gas turbines. "You think about the US, and between 40% to 45% of our electricity comes from gas power today, and we're about to go into a real load cycle," GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik recently told Yahoo Finance. "In the rest of the world, that number is closer to 25%. But as other parts of the world shift like the US has shifted — with things like coal to gas — the proportion of gas electricity will only grow." The erosion of regulation surrounding the energy business, which is anticipated under the new Trump administration, is also expected to benefit the industry. For example, the administration is expected to get rid of restrictions surrounding liquified natural gas (LNG) export permits and pipeline projects. "Regulations act as an added cost," said Philip Rossetti, a resident senior fellow at the right-leaning R Street Institute. "If you're expecting less regulation you're probably going to be expecting more profitability." Oklahoma-based natural gas processing and transportation company the Williams Companies (WMB) and oil and gas midstream operator Oneok (OKE) are both up more than 40% year to date. Meanwhile, US LNG exports are expected to rise 15% next year, according to government data, as Europe continues to build storage capacity to reduce its dependence on Russia amid the Ukraine war. S&P Global Commodity Insights predicts prices at Henry Hub, the main futures contracts delivery point, will average more than $4.00 per million metric British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025 after two years averaging below $3.00/MMBtu. "The uptick in exports will put significant strain on the domestic US natural gas market," the organization's 2025 energy outlook report said. Still, some Wall Street analysts believe the full impact of policy changes around exports and delays around LNG supply projects may slow any upward price move. Goldman Sachs analysts now expect natural gas to reach $4/MMBtu in 2026 instead of its previous timeline of the fourth quarter of 2025. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But Jassy's messaging on an increased ratio of individual contributors to managers raises a much bigger question about organizational structure: What is the right balance between individual workers and managers in overall headcount? It's a question that corporations have long struggled to define with anything but anecdotal findings. With companies now firmly in a post-Covid world, organizational experts say Amazon may be leading the way in a new look at efficiency gains related to corporate bloat, and especially middle management bloat. "We have grown our teams quickly and substantially," said an Amazon spokesperson, echoing the message in Jassy's note: "When I think about my time at Amazon, I never imagined I'd be at the company for 27 years … Part of why I've stayed has been the unprecedented growth (we had $15M of annual revenue the year before I joined—this year should be well north of $600B)." That growth, the spokesperson said, inevitably led to adding a lot of managers. Comparing Amazon's plan to Meta's recent year of efficiency, the spokesperson said the company ended up adding more layers than it had before due to its growth and now is the right time to bring the structure "closer to our customers" and reinforce Amazon's "culture of ownership." Over the past few years, layoffs have been as prominent as hiring in the tech sector. In 2022-2023, the sector was in what could be called the years of the layoff. While that headcount trimming continues, the Amazon thinking involves a broader rethink of how to rightsize the largest corporations. Morgan Stanley analysts suggested that Amazon could cut as many as 14,000 management positions, with the corporate efficiencies accounting for $2 billion-$4 billion in savings. Morgan Stanley's forecast was based on an assumption that Jassy made in the note that Amazon is targeting an increase in the ratio of individual contributors to managers "by at least 15% by the end of 1Q25, across all divisions." Jassy pointed to "artifacts" of headcount growth, such as the "pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings," and has created a "Bureaucracy Mailbox" for employees to share processes that slow down decision-making and that he said "crept in and we can root out." This is not a process that is unique to Amazon, said Joseph Roh, professor at the Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University. Rapid growth can lead to the rapid addition of "management layers without reassessing whether these roles are necessary," he said. In general, the flatter structure is in, and there is now greater emphasis on individual contributors across corporations. There is no exact formula, no "golden ratio" for contributor-to-manager. "My understanding is that the ideal ratio of individual contributors to managers depends largely on the nature of the work," Roh said, but he added that it is generally in the neighborhood of 7 to 10 individual contributors per manager. Investor and economic pressure play a role, and at a time when technology giants are spending billions on AI without being able to deliver to Wall Street immediate proof of the return on investment, a conscious effort to rein in other costs will be rewarded. And despite the fact that companies like Amazon want everyone back in the office, spit-balling ideas around the proverbial whiteboard or watercooler, there is a sense that AI already may be playing a role in a more direct way, with some middle management positions redundant. "Digital transformation plays a significant role," Roh said, "as automation and advanced technologies reduce the need for middle managers to oversee tasks that can now be monitored by software." "What you saw from Amazon is just the beginning," said Naeem Zafar, a professor at UC Berkeley Haas School of Business and Northeastern University, with the downsizing of the managerial layer a larger trend set to play out across corporate America. Technology companies that have dominated the economy and grown rapidly are leading the way, preaching the return to an approach of being nimble and innovative, but Zafar said there are also cultural factors at work. "The new generation of employees are different and work differently," he said, citing growing use of communication tools and a general work culture ethos that privileges freedom and balks at micro-management. According to Roh, organizations are adapting to the preferences of a younger workforce that "values less hierarchy and more autonomy in their roles." Zafar said the rise of AI alongside a new generation of workers reinforces this evolving view of managers. "Amazon's slashing of manager roles isn't just about cost-cutting; it's a glimpse into the future of work. Technology is eating away at the traditional corporate ladder, and middle management is feeling the bite," Zafar said. For decades, managers have been seen as "the glue holding companies together" and a key to translating strategy into action. But today, Zafar said, "AI-powered tools can analyze data, assign tasks, and track performance with unprecedented efficiency." That makes it inevitable that the question will arise, "Why pay for a middleman when a machine can do it better?" he added. Roh said Amazon's growth may make it an extreme example, but it is perhaps also a leading indicator. "Amazon's rebalancing reflects a broader corporate trend toward leaner, more efficient organizational structures, driven by the need for cost control, innovation, and competitiveness in rapidly evolving markets," he said. From health care to finance, companies are realizing that flatter hierarchies mean faster decisions and potentially bigger profits. As with any effort to improve efficiency and the bottom line, there are risks in an era of corporate flattening. Sacrificing employee well-being and the crucial human elements of leadership and innovation are challenges that will be at the center of this reshuffling in corporate America, Zafar said. But he added, "The future belongs to companies that can build lean, agile structures, empowering employees to thrive in a world where machines do the heavy lifting." Got a confidential news tip?

Title: The final Fed meeting of 2024 awaits: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The stock market rally has stalled as the final Federal Reserve meeting of the year approaches. In the past week, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was the only of the three major indexes to post a weekly gain, closing up more than 0.3%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.6%, while a decline in healthcare stocks weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which slid nearly 2%. The Dow has now fallen for seven straight sessions, its worst stretch since February 2020. Investors are set to receive a jam-packed week of economic news, highlighted by the Fed's next interest rate decision on Dec. 18. Markets widely expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, and investors are likely to focus on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says about the path forward in 2025 during his press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Updates on November retail sales, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index — the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — and activity in the services and manufacturing sectors are also on the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Micron (MU), Nike (NKE), FedEx (FDX) and Carnival Corporation (CCL) are expected. Entering Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting, markets are pricing in a roughly 97% chance the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by 25 basis points, per the CME FedWatch tool. But given recent data that showed the US economy is growing at a solid pace, the labor market isn't rapidly cooling, and inflation's path to the Fed's 2% goal is proving bumpy, many expect the Fed will cut rates by less than initially thought in 2025. Key to watch is the Fed's latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). That includes its "dot plot," which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future, as well as commentary from Powell during his press conference. Read more: What experts say about the possibility of additional rate cuts When the Fed last issued its dot plot in September, the median forecast was for the fed funds rate to end 2025 in a range of 3.25% to 3.5%. Instead of the four rate cuts in 2024 projected back in September, markets are pricing in just two rate cuts for next year, per Bloomberg data. "We think that the economic forecasts will show better growth and firmer inflation this year and that the median interest rate forecast dots will be revised to show three cuts next year instead of four, as in the September dots," JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note to clients. Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave wrote in a note to clients that Powell is likely to point to a "slower pace" of cuts during his press conference including a pause in the rate-cutting cycle in January. Prior to the Fed's decision on Wednesday, officials will get a fresh reading on the state of the consumer with the November retail sales report. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.5% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into the gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.4%. Bank of America's US economics team thinks this report will reflect a strong start to the holiday shopping period. "Online retail spending was particularly strong around the Thanksgiving period," the team wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "In fact, holiday spending is running ahead of cumulative 2023 levels despite a delayed Thanksgiving. Hence, we expect a robust retail sales report for Nov, with retail sales ex-autos and the core control category coming in at 0.5% m/m." Last week, readings of both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) showed signs of inflation making little progress toward the Fed's 2% target. But many economists argued that there were promising signs within the details of those reports that should lead to a less concerning reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge next Friday. Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.9% in November, up from the 2.8% seen in October. But over the prior month, economists project "core" PCE at 0.2%, lower than the 0.3% increase seen in October. "In our view, November data on inflation should provide comfort that the disinflation process remains in place," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Although headline and core CPI came in slightly above our expectation ... we found the details of the report favorable for thinking inflation would continue to move lower in the near-term." For 10 straight trading days more stocks have declined than risen in the S&P 500, the longest such stretch since September 2001. Still, over that time period which spans all of December thus far, the S&P 500 is up about 0.3%. Meanwhile, the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 (^SPXEW), which isn't overly influenced by movements in large stocks within the index, is down more than 3%. "Savvy traders should at least pay attention to some of the warning signs about the overall health of the market. So far, it is the sniffles or just a case of bad breadth," Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "But there are some symptoms that can lead to something more meaningful if left unattended." To Sosnick's point, for now, a rally in the largest tech stocks in the market is keeping the benchmark index afloat. On Wednesday the Nasdaq Composite closed above 20,000 for the first time ever as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) all surged to record highs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance that this market action comes as investors have been digesting sticky inflation prints, and the possibility of the Fed cutting interest rates less than initially, though next year isn't a "surprise." "If rates are going to stay a little bit more elevated for a little bit longer than the consensus expected, then companies who have a net benefit from higher rates probably do well in that scenario," Gordon said while noting that the "Magnificent Seven" stocks fit that description.

On Wednesday the Nasdaq Composite closed above 20,000 for the first time ever as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) all surged to record highs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance that this market action comes as investors have been digesting sticky inflation prints, and the possibility of the Fed cutting interest rates less than initially, though next year isn't a "surprise." "If rates are going to stay a little bit more elevated for a little bit longer than the consensus expected, then companies who have a net benefit from higher rates probably do well in that scenario," Gordon said while noting that the "Magnificent Seven" stocks fit that description.

Inflation has remained sticky, raising fear that the Federal Reserve could be prevented from further ... [+] interest rate cuts. For example, meat and egg prices are 3.8% higher year-over-year, while auto insurance has risen a whopping 12.7%. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, and last week’s hotter inflation data made the rate cut decision a bit more complicated. Meanwhile, economic data remains resilient, with the most recent estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth from the Atlanta Federal Reserve at 3.3%. Consumer inflation (CPI) ticked up to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6% in October, consistent with expectations. Producer inflation (PPI) was above consensus at 3.0%, up from 2.6% previously. In both cases, inflation has remained sticky and above the 2% level. U.S. Consumer & Producer Inflation Recent headline CPI readings have been accelerating, with the three-month annualized rate running at 2.8%, likely making some Fed voters nervous about a resurgence in inflation. U.S. Consumer Inflation: CPI The recent upward trend in inflation has also affected core CPI, excluding food and energy. Annualizing the last 3 months, the core CPI ran at a hot 3.7%. U.S. Consumer Inflation: Core CPI Though it will be released after the Fed's decision, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE price index, should be at 2.9% year-over-year for November, which is well above the 2% target rate. While some other components of inflation might be stickier than expected, the Fed should be very confident that the rate of housing inflation should continue to moderate. Like Zillow, real-time measures of rent inflation point to downward pressure on the government’s lagging measure of rent inflation. Shelter inflation is 36.6% of the CPI measurement, which is meaningful. CPI & Rent Inflation While the last payroll report was solid on the surface, there were some cracks, such as the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Fed members are likely to focus on the softening of the labor market as a downside risk to the economy. The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits are above early-year levels, illustrating the rising risk to the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The Federal Reserve began this easing cycle because monetary policy was too tight for the economic conditions. Looking at the real (after-inflation) level of the Federal Funds rate, monetary policy remains restrictive. This situation will likely convince Fed participants to vote for a rate cut as insurance against the downside economic risks at the Wednesday meeting. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Despite the sticky inflation data, futures pricing agrees with the analysis with over 90% odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the Fed meeting this week. The most significant change has been a reduction in the pace of rate cuts in 2025. The elevated inflation readings and resilient economy point to the Fed pausing rate cuts at the January 29th meeting to await more evidence of economic trends. While the rate cut on Wednesday won’t surprise markets, the Fed will update their forecasts. Those forecasts and Chair Powell’s comments will be parsed closely to judge the future pace of easing monetary policy but should include increased inflation and economic growth estimates.

Stock Market Performance This week will be full of economic releases ahead of the slower Christmas holiday week. Retail sales on Tuesday will be particularly crucial in judging the resilience of the consumer, but the main event will likely be Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting. Despite inflation remaining stickier than many would like, the Fed will almost surely cut short-term interest rates again.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

Time Published: 2024-12-15T11:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 15 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 15 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis.

The Christmas holiday is fast approaching, and the festive spirit is in full swing as people gear up for celebrations, shopping sprees, and family reunions. While only a few companies are set to release earnings reports this week, the stock market is bracing for a potentially pivotal moment. This week, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce whether it will lower interest rates—a decision that could significantly influence the economic and financial landscape heading into 2025. With this critical development on the horizon, let’s explore what lies ahead in the world of the stock market this week. This week will be relatively lighter for earnings reports. Among the key highlights, Micron Technology (MU+0.58%) is set to announce its quarterly results on Wednesday after the closing bell. On Thursday, Accenture (ACN-0.32%) will unveil its financial performance before the opening bell. Later that day, both Nike (NKE+1.65%) and FedEx (FDX-2.64%) will take the spotlight, with their earnings reports scheduled for release after the market wraps up. The week ahead is packed with critical macroeconomic data releases, beginning Tuesday with the U.S. retail sales report for November, which will provide insights into consumer spending trends. Additionally, the Home Builder Confidence Index for December will be unveiled, shedding light on the outlook for the housing market. Wednesday takes center stage as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces its highly anticipated decision on interest rates. The CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which measures market expectations for Fed fund rate changes, expects a 25-basis-point rate cut. Following the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will speak on the economic outlook and monetary policy trajectory. Thursday will feature the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data, and along with that, the latest figures on existing home sales will be posted. The week concludes on Friday with the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, a key measure of inflation tracking changes in consumer spending on goods and services. Additionally, the consumer sentiment report for December will be unveiled. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: Nvida’s next stop is $160-170; AMD, Adobe downgraded

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Jordan Klein, a tech desk sector strategist at Mizuho (NYSE:MFG) maintains a positive outlook for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), expecting the company’s management to deliver a highly optimistic perspective during investor sessions at the CES conference in early January. Mizuho projects NVIDIA's stock could climb to the $160-$170 range ahead of the GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in March, where the company is set to unveil its new product, Rubin. "All agree that NVDA sets up well to go on another run to new all-time highs in Q125 into Feb earnings date and GTC in March,” Klein wrote. “View is that NVDA mgmt. will reinforce a very bullish view at investor meetings during CES in early Jan. I get sense some think Next (LON:NXT) stop NVDA is $160-170 level into GTC and the big preview of Rubin. I can feel the NVDA – AMD pair trade being sized up already," he added. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analysts reaffirmed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as their top pick for 2025, highlighting three key catalysts supporting their optimistic outlook. The first driver is the potential impact of Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI initiative, on iPhone replacement cycles. While current iPhone demand remains muted, Morgan Stanley sees broader availability of Apple Intelligence in fiscal 2025 sparking a surge in demand. The firm forecasts iPhone shipments to grow 12% year-over-year to 258 million units in fiscal 2026, fueled by features such as enhanced Siri, AI image tools, and ChatGPT integration. “A relatively moderate replacement cycle contraction of just 0.3 years off an all-time replacement cycle high of ~5 years” is expected, according to analysts led by Erik W. Woodring. The second catalyst is sustained double-digit growth in Apple’s services segment, underpinned by pricing power, broader adoption, and new offerings. Morgan Stanley projects an 11.4% compound annual growth rate in services revenue through fiscal 2027, exceeding consensus expectations. The report highlights that less than half of Apple’s user base currently subscribes to services. Combined with mid-single-digit annual growth in the installed base and pricing adjustments, annual services growth could gain an additional six percentage points. Finally, Morgan Stanley anticipates steady gross margin expansion over the next three years, driven by a favorable revenue mix, cost efficiencies, and the faster growth of services revenue. While memory costs have risen, the analysts highlight “an emerging cyclical tailwind in 2025” as memory prices stabilize. They estimate annual gross margin growth of 50 basis points through fiscal 2027. Meanwhile, Mizuho raised its price target for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $260 from $240, highlighting the growing potential of generative AI (GenAI) applications as a key growth driver. The firm pointed to innovations showcased at the AWS re:Invent 2024 conference, which aim to overcome barriers in deploying GenAI solutions and pave the way for significant growth in fiscal 2025. According to Mizuho, AWS’s efforts are centered on three areas: cost reduction, simplified application development, and advanced AI-agent functionalities. AWS’s new Trainium2 chip, which reduces capacity costs by 40%, is expected to provide a cost-effective solution for scaling GenAI. Mizuho also emphasized the Bedrock platform’s ability to streamline coding, data integration, and model selection, enabling faster application development. Further, AWS is advancing AI-agent workflows in areas like loan underwriting, using foundational models with enhanced reasoning and context processing capabilities. These developments are expected to drive GenAI adoption across industries. "With use-cases moving into production, we expect inferencing volume should accelerate through application development and usage in FY25, affirming our thesis of Gen-AI's consumption multiplier effect," Mizuho wrote. In turn, the firm has increased its FY25 AWS revenue growth forecast to 21%, up from 19%. Earlier this week, Bank of America downgraded Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock to Neutral from Buy, citing risks to its 2025 outlook. The firm also cut its price target for AMD to $155 from $180 and reduced its 2025/26 earnings per share (EPS) projections by 6% and 8%, noting a 13-23% gap compared to consensus estimates. Two key factors underpin BofA’s cautious view. The first is competitive pressure in the AI market, particularly from NVIDIA and custom chipmakers like Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which could constrain AMD’s market share growth. “Recently largest cloud customer, Amazon strongly indicated its preference for alternative custom (Trainium/ MRVL) and NVDA products, but a lack of strong demand for AMD,” adding that other major cloud providers, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), show similar preferences. BofA estimates AMD will hold just 4% of the $200 billion AI accelerator market in 2025, a sharp contrast to NVIDIA’s dominant 80%+ share. The second concern is a potential slowdown in the PC processor market in early 2025. After a robust 40% half-on-half increase in AMD’s client PC sales in late 2024, BofA expects the market could soften, putting pressure on the company’s growth trajectory. On the other hand, BofA acknowledged AMD’s strong execution and ability to benefit from Intel’s restructuring, which could open doors for greater market share in PC and server CPUs. The report also highlighted AMD’s solid relationships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as positives but noted limited opportunities for the company to exceed Street expectations in the AI segment. Following weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, TD Cowen downgraded Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) from Buy to Hold and lowered its price target from $625 to $550. The firm highlighted several challenges that could weigh on Adobe's growth prospects, including a slowdown in growth trends and potential disruptions related to changes in its go-to-market (GTM) strategy. Adobe reported fourth-quarter net new annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of $578 million, representing a 2% year-over-year increase. While this exceeded guidance by about 5%, it fell short of the average beat over the trailing twelve months. For fiscal 2025, Adobe’s growth guidance of 8-10%—including a 50-75 basis points headwind from foreign exchange—came in below the Street’s expectation of 11%. Moreover, management forecasts a 50 basis points decline in operating margin, contrary to the flat margin projected by analysts. ARR growth is also expected to slow, decelerating from 13% to 11%. TD Cowen also notes that Adobe is prioritizing the adoption of AI technologies over immediate monetization. While some AI-driven initiatives, such as GenStudio for enterprises and the AI Assistant in Acrobat, are gaining traction, they currently represent a small portion of revenue. Looking ahead, analysts see multiple headwinds for Adobe in 2025. These include the waning of pricing tailwinds in the first half of the year, potential disruptions from GTM changes in the first quarter, and indications of weaker growth trends based on partner checks.

U.Today - Chinese cryptocurrency journalist and blogger Colin Wu spreads the word about the positive Bitcoin-related changes that are taking place in Thailand now. Besides, the former price minister of the country Thaksin Shinawatra has made an ultra-bullish Bitcoin price prediction. He also believes that it is important to raise Bitcoin awareness among the population. Therefore, an order has been issued to set up a sandbox that would allow BTC to be used for payments in Phuket. This initiative came up after the outcome of the recent presidential elections in the U.S. and the expected pivot in cryptocurrency policies in the country in the near future. Some politicians in Thailand believe that the U.S. may use Bitcoin to repay its national debt or part of it to creditors. Besides, Thailand may start deep research and study of stablecoins. The goal is to find out whether it is possible to invest money in the economy without printing more banknotes by issuing coins backed by government bonds. If this is done, Thaksin Shinawatra reckons that the country’s economy will definitely show impressive growth. The Nasdaq 100 index also includes such tech giants as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). MicroStrategy’s market capitalization boost (the key requirement for a company to be added to Nasdaq) has been down its Bitcoin strategy since 2020, when the company started its regular bets on BTC. As of December 2024, Saylor’s company holds 423,650 Bitcoin roughly worth $41.5 billion. Over the past couple of years, MicroStrategy has been issuing senior convertible bonds to raise billions of U.S. dollars to make large new Bitcoin acquisitions.

Title: Billionaire Warren Buffett Bets $120,000,000,000 on Two Assets After Dumping Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo

Billionaire Warren Buffett is now betting a whopping $120 billion on just two assets. The chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has allocated 40.1% of the firm’s portfolio to Apple (AAPL) and American Express (AXP), according to new SEC filings. Berkshire initiated its investment in Apple back in 2016 and has adjusted its holdings multiple times, including significant reductions this year.

Billionaire Warren Buffett is now betting a whopping $120 billion on just two assets. The chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has allocated 40.1% of the firm’s portfolio to Apple (AAPL) and American Express (AXP), according to new SEC filings. Berkshire initiated its investment in Apple back in 2016 and has adjusted its holdings multiple times, including significant reductions this year.

Title: Media Insider: Omnicom and IPG – advertising’s global mega-merger and the impact on the New Zealand industry and clients

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The work of Kiwi creatives in global advertising firms has been world-class, including campaigns such as 'Ghost Chips', 'Driving Dogs' and 'Togs, Undies'. New Zealand’s advertising industry is in for a shake-up – amid fears of staff cutbacks, concerns about client conflicts, and broader market impacts – as two of the world’s biggest agencies merge to form a global behemoth. Omnicom’s (OMG) planned US$13 billion acquisition of IPG – announced in the US this week – is a seismic shift that will reverberate around the world, including in New Zealand, where major OMG brands such as PHD, OMD, Colenso, DDB, Clemenger, TBWA, Hearts & Science and Dynamo will be now housed under the same umbrella as IPG agencies such as FCB and Initiative. The OMG-IPG giant will become the world’s biggest advertising holding company, surpassing Publicis and WPP. The move and its market impacts are likely to be carefully monitored by the anti-competitive watchdog Commerce Commission as well as smaller, New Zealand-owned independent agencies and the broader industry. Sources say OMG agencies already lay claim to more than 50% of media spend in New Zealand; the new mega-merger will only reinforce that dominance. “As a result, OMG will command significant buying power which may place pressure on both media owners, who will likely be pushed to deliver the best price and value to OMG clients, and independent agencies, who may struggle to compete with these pressures,” said one source. “Managing conflict will be OMG’s main priority as clients may have concerns at how their businesses will be managed. At an initial glance, a newly consolidated OMG would have the three main telco clients (Spark, One NZ and 2degrees), almost all of the major banks and various other clashing clients.” But while big might seem beautiful, there will be plenty of nervous staff in the various agencies. “Behind the celebratory headlines and executive statements lies a stark reality for employees at Omnicom and IPG,” reported CEO Today. “The announcement’s promise of $750 million ($NZ1.3 billion) in cost synergies has sparked fears of widespread layoffs, particularly among overlapping functions and agencies.” One advertising analyst told the website: “Consolidation is the name of the game right now. This merger sets a new benchmark and signals that scale is no longer optional in an industry dominated by big tech platforms like Google and Amazon.” New Zealand sources believe it will still take some time for big changes, such as cutbacks, to filter to the local market. Even so, there would be broader market impacts. “The concentration of market power is quite a significant issue,” said one source. “You could ostensibly have DDB, FCB, Colenso and Clemenger all pitching for the same Government account, for instance. This might create the impression of different companies, but all essentially feed into the same mothership. From a procurement perspective, this could pose an interesting ethical dilemma for government departments. “How comfortable should a government department feel knowing that all those businesses are owned by the same organisation?” Client clashes and conflicts within agencies were also flagged as an industry concern. “Ad agencies have always been pretty good at managing this,” said one source. “It wasn’t that long ago that DDB had Westpac, Colenso BBDO had BNZ and TBWA had ANZ, despite all these agencies being owned by Omnicom. We’re going to see much more of that happening as even more brands are brought under the same umbrella. It now becomes a question of how comfortable clients feel about this – especially in the event that we do see some consolidation.” Independent Media Agencies of New Zealand (IMANZ) general manager Kath Mitchell said her members were resilient, quoting latest industry data showing 49% had expanded in the past 12 months and a further 28% had been stable. “However, we need to consider how far that resilience can stretch. Mergers like this mean we will see a concentration of greater market power in a single holding company. We should, at the very least, be having conversations about what impact that has.” She said data also showed 45% of IMANZ members did not have a single government client. “I would hope that the news of this merger helps to draw attention to how the industry is structured and how much power is concentrated in a small group of holding companies. “My advice to those who work in government procurement is to look deeper at agency ownership and often they will find they feed into one of those holding companies sending their profits offshore.” A Commerce Commission spokeswoman said the organisation had not received any material at this stage about the proposed global transaction, “but we are aware of it”. “We assess mergers using the substantial lessening of competition test. This test asks whether a merger is likely to substantially lessen competition by comparing the likely state of competition if the merger proceeds with the likely state of competition if the merger does not proceed. “We will give clearance to a proposed merger if we are satisfied that the merger is unlikely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a New Zealand market.” Omnicom chief executive John Wren said in a statement that the acquisition of Interpublic would “harness the significant opportunities created by new technologies in this era of exponential change.” The deal is expected to be in place by the second half of next year. It perhaps seems questionable whether New York executives will be too bothered about seeking permission in this part of the world. The Commerce Commission spokeswoman acknowledged that filing for a merger clearance in New Zealand was voluntary. “The commission cannot require parties to file for clearance,” she said. “However, if parties do not file for clearance, and the commission forms the view that their transaction may have or may have had, the effect of substantially lessening competition, the commission can open an investigation into the transaction and ultimately take enforcement action which could result in significant penalties or a court reversing the transaction.” “It’s important to understand that the impact of this flows through to some of the best ad agency brands in this country,” says former NZ Herald advertising and marketing columnist Damien Venuto, now a senior account director at One Plus One. “If you look at the likes of DDB, FCB, TBWA, Colenso BBDO and Clemenger, you’re talking about the companies that have given us some of the most loved ads in the history of New Zealand. “Driving Dogs, the Lotto Pirate Ship, Togs-Undies and Ghost Chips are just some of the campaigns to have emerged from these brands. What you’re talking about here is talent and cultural history in our creative sector.” The deal meant that all profits that flowed through these companies would ultimately end up in the newly merged US-listed entity. “This, of course, isn’t new,” said Venuto. “As long as there have been holding companies, advertising money spent in New Zealand has flowed through to those global juggernauts. The difference now is that we have one less holding company competing for a cut of an even more consolidated pie. “I expect independent agencies, which New Zealand has in abundance, will look for ways to capitalise on this opportunity and play up their point of difference.” Mitchell said: “While our independent media agencies cannot compete with the scale of global holding companies, we bring agility, adaptability and innovation to the table to create bespoke strategies for clients. She said independent media agencies were able to implement innovative strategies that larger firms might be slower to adopt. The independents could “push creative boundaries without corporate constraints”, she said. Furthermore, independent media agencies were willing and prepared to collaborate with the global agencies when it made commercial sense for all parties involved, especially the client. “When you invest in a local independent media agency, you know every cent of that is staying in New Zealand. IMANZ members processed an estimated $570 million in annual billings last year and employ over 760 employees across the country – there’s a great opportunity for local to support local.” Meanwhile, Omnicom and some of their agency executives in this part of the world are not keen to comment at this stage. “Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide any commentary at this moment. Thank you for your understanding,” said OMG APAC chief communications and talent experience officer Justin Low. Editor-at-Large Shayne Currie is one of New Zealand’s most experienced senior journalists and media leaders. He has held executive and senior editorial roles at NZME including Managing Editor, NZ Herald Editor and Herald on Sunday Editor and has a small shareholding in NZME.

Title: Klarna's CEO says it stopped hiring thanks to AI but still advertises many open positions | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski recently told Bloomberg TV that his company essentially stopped hiring a year ago and credited generative AI for enabling this massive workforce reduction. However, despite Siemiatkowski’s bullishness on AI, the company is not relying entirely on AI to replace human workers who leave, as open job listings — for more humans — and the company’s own statements confirm. “We stopped hiring about a year ago. We were 4,500, now we’re 3,500,” Siemiatkowski told Bloomberg TV. “We have a natural attrition, as [does] every tech company. People stay about 5 years — so 20% leave every year — and by not hiring, we’re simply shrinking.” The company’s CEO also said he believes AI can effectively replace workers. “I am of the opinion that AI can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do,” said Siemiatkowski. “We’re gonna give some of the improvements [from] the efficiency that AI provides by increasing the pace at which the salaries of our employees increases.” Siemiatkowski often makes this variety of comments. To start 2024, the Klarna CEO said ChatGPT was doing the work of 700 human employees. At another point, he said that Klarna was dropping Salesforce as a CRM provider and replacing it with AI, a comment Marc Benioff expressed skepticism about. Just this week, the Klarna CEO made an AI deepfake of himself to report his financial results, attempting to prove that even a CEO can be replaced by AI. But in practice, while Klarna has significantly reduced its workforce in the last year, the buy now, pay later company has not completely stopped hiring. Klarna is currently hiring for more than 50 roles around the globe, according to the job postings page on its website. Furthermore, Klarna’s managers have said they are actively hiring or growing their teams at least half a dozen times throughout 2024, according to posts on LinkedIn viewed by TechCrunch. Klarna also hired several new employees in the last year to fill roles on its policy, software engineering, and global partnerships teams, according to LinkedIn posts from recently hired Klarna employees. Klarna’s global press lead, John Craske, tells TechCrunch that Siemiatkowski’s comments about hiring are directionally true but says the CEO was “simplifying for brevity in a broadcast interview.” “When you look at it historically, we were hiring between one to one and a half thousand people a year from 2019 to 2022,” said Craske in an email. “Now, we’re not actively recruiting to expand the workforce but only backfilling some essential roles, predominantly engineering.” In other words, not every job can be replaced with AI today. While AI may be helping Klarna do more work with fewer people, it’s worth noting that Klarna has the same number of employees today as it did in 2021. Like most tech companies, Klarna was hiring a lot during the pandemic. Many companies, including Meta and Amazon, have reduced their workforces in the last few years, either by slowing down hiring or having layoffs. It’s also worth pointing out that Klarna is looking to IPO soon. Siemiatkowski could be trying to convince investors that his company is aggressively incorporating generative AI into its workflows and that the benefits are already showing up. But for most companies these days, AI adoption and implementation are happening at a much slower rate.

Investing.com -- As the second week of December ended, several stocks experienced significant volatility, mostly as a reaction to their earnings results. Out of many, here are Investing.com’s stocks of the week: Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) experienced a sharp decline after reporting disappointing guidance on Thursday, leading several analysts, including those from RBC Capital, Mizuho (NYSE:MFG), Piper Sandler, and Oppenheimer, to lower their price targets to a range of $590–$620. RBC Capital cut its price target to $590 from $610, citing reduced estimates but maintained an Outperform rating. The firm noted that Adobe’s quarterly results were solid, with record DM net-new ARR, although the upside was smaller compared to recent quarters. "ADBE has been a frustrating stock for much of FY24. Having said that, we remain confident ADBE will significantly monetize its Generative AI innovations going forward, and we expect healthy upside to the FY25 ARR/revenue guidance as the year unfolds.," an analyst at Mizuho said. On Friday, Adobe’s stock continued to decline, trading about 2% lower at $465. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock saw positive reaction after its earnings, buoyed by upbeat guidance and surging AI revenues. The company hit a trillion-dollar valuation on Friday and shares climbed over 24%. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed its Overweight rating and a $250 price target for the stock. “We see the strength in AI continuing at a rapid pace for AVGO, and the company has laid out a SAM of $60B–$90B with its three AI customers that it currently does business with,” an analyst at Piper Sandler noted. This week, Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) announced its new corporate structure, under which Warner Bros. Discovery will serve as the parent company for two distinct operating divisions - Global Linear Networks and Streaming & Studios. "We continue to prioritize ensuring our Global Linear Networks business is well positioned to continue to drive free cash flow, while our Streaming & Studios business focuses on driving growth by telling the world’s most compelling stories," according to the firm's President and CEO, David Zaslav. The company expects to complete the implementation of the new corporate structure by mid-2025. The new structure is expected to give it more flexibility. Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google kicked off the week by unveiling a new chip called Willow, which demonstrates advanced error correction and performance capabilities, paving the way for a functional, large-scale quantum computer. The tech giant also unveiled Gemini 2.0, its latest AI model, which Google claims is its most advanced yet. Even though shares rose during the week following these announcements, Alphabet shares ended the week down by 1.11%. Separately, The Information reported on Thursday that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai was expected to meet with President-elect Donald Trump.

Title: OpenAI launches canvas, Cohere's compact model, and more fundraising: This week's AI launches

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. OpenAI made canvas, an interface to “collaborate” with ChatGPT on writing and coding projects, available to all web and Windows desktop users this week. The feature was made available in beta to ChatGPT Plus and Team users in October. Now out of beta, canvas is built directly into OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, so it doesn’t need to be selected separately in ChatGPT’s model picker. Other new features include running Python code directly in canvas for improvement suggestions and bug fixes, and compatibility with custom-made GPTs. Cohere released Command R7B — the smallest, fastest, and last model in its R series of large language models (LLMs) for the enterprise — this week. Due to its compact size, the model can be served on low-end graphics processing units (GPUs), core processing units (CPUs), and a MacBook to accelerate production of AI applications. In its class of open-weights models, Command R7B delivers state-of-the-art performance in real-world tasks such as reasoning and agentic behavior, according to the startup. “The model is designed for developers and businesses that need to optimize for the speed, cost-performance, and compute resources of their use cases,” Cohere said. Command R7B is available on the Cohere Platform and on HuggingFace. Speak, a language learning AI startup, announced a $78 million Series C funding round this week. The deal, which values the company at $1 billion, was led by Accel, and included existing investors such as OpenAI Startup Fund and Khosla Ventures. The Series C marks the AI language tutor’s second raise this year, and has doubled the startup’s valuation in six months. “We’ve engineered a breakthrough in spoken fluency by combining our proprietary learning method with advanced AI that adapts to each user’s needs, making true fluency accessible to so many more people,” Connor Zwick, chief executive and co-founder of Speak, said in a statement. “So far this year, users have already spoken more than one billion sentences with Speak.” Zwick said Speak plans to expand to more countries in 2025. Ayar Labs, a startup that developed the first in-package optical I/O solution to replace electrical I/O in AI training and inferencing chips, announced a $155 million Series D funding round this week. The deal was led by Advent Global Opportunities and Light Street Capital, and included investments from AMD Ventures (AMD), Intel Capital (INTC), and Nvidia (NVDA). Ayar Labs is now valued at more than $1 billion. The startup is changing the way data moves between chips with its I/O technology, which it says can “eliminate bottlenecks created by traditional copper interconnects and pluggable optics.” The funding will allow Ayar Labs to scale its technology, which “allows customers to maximize the compute efficiency and performance of their AI infrastructure, while reducing costs and power consumption, to dramatically improve profitability metrics for AI applications.” “The leading GPU providers — AMD and NVIDIA — and semiconductor foundries — GlobalFoundries (GFS), Intel Foundry, and TSMC (TSM) — combined with the backing of Advent, Light Street, and our other investors underscores the potential of our optical I/O technology to redefine the future of AI infrastructure,” Mark Wade, chief executive and co-founder of Ayar Labs, said in a statement. “We are incredibly fortunate to have the backing of Light Street’s deep expertise in technology-specific investments as well as Advent’s robust private and growth equity background in this funding round.” Gentrace, a developer platform that allows entire product teams to collaborate on AI testing and monitoring, announced an $8 million Series A funding round this week. The funding round was led by Matrix Partners, and brings the startup’s total funding to $14 million. With the Gentrace platform, product managers, subject matter experts, designers, and quality assurance can all collaborate on evaluating AI model performance with engineering teams. The startup also launched Experiments, a tool enabling collaborative large language model (LLM) testing. The tool allows teams to preview test outcomes before deploying models and anticipate errors, among other features. “Generative AI represents a paradigm shift in software development, but the reality is there’s way too much noise and not enough signal on how to test and build them easily or correctly,” Doug Safreno, co-founder and chief executive of Gentrace, said in a statement. “We’re not just creating another dev tool — we’re reimagining how entire organizations can collaborate and build better LLM products.” Crusoe, a vertically integrated AI infrastructure provider, announced a $600 million Series D funding round this week. The deal was led by Founders Fund and included Nvidia as an investor. The startup provides cost-effective and “environmentally aligned” AI infrastructure by harnessing large-scale clean energy. Crusoe also builds AI-optimized data centers and has a development platform. “We believe a new approach is needed to power the AI revolution,” Chase Lochmiller, chief executive and co-founder of Crusoe, said in a statement. “To reduce complexity, accelerate time-to-value, and support the most demanding AI solutions, customers need a vertically integrated approach. We are able to innovate faster and bring new, state-of-the-art capacity online in a fraction of the time compared to legacy cloud providers while delivering unmatched results for customers, making the promises of AI a reality.” Crusoe also announced its Crusoe Cloud platform is generally available for AI and machine learning workloads.

Title: Michael Saylor’s Relentless Focus on Bitcoin Lands His Firm in the Nasdaq-100 Index

On December 13, the Nasdaq stock exchange, founded in 1971, which pioneered the concept of electronic trading and which hosts many of the world’s leading tech firms, announced that on December 23, MicroStrategy Inc., which is one of the companies listed on the exchange, would get added to the Nasdaq-100 Index, which is a stock market index launched in January 1985 that tracks the performance of the 100 largest (by market capitalization) non-financial firms listed on the Nasdaq exchange. It is worth pointing out that Nasdaq-100 and QQQ are not the same — the former is an index while the latter is an exchange-traded fund (ETF). QQQ, which is officially known as the Invesco QQQ Trust, is an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 index, providing investors with a way to get exposure to the firms in the Nasdaq-100 through a single investment product. Nasdaq also announced that two other firms would be joining MicroStrategy on Nasdaq-100: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXON). Although Nasdaq is best known for being the world’s premier exchange for tech firms, in reality it hosts firms from a diverse array of sectors. Another index launched at the same time as the Nasdaq-100 is the Nasdaq Financial-100 Index, which consists of the the 100 largest (by market cap) financial firms. The Nasdaq-100 is reconstituted annually in December, “timed to coincide with the quadruple witch expiration Friday of the quarter,” with the changes becoming effective just before the market opens, usually some date in mid-to-late December. Getting added to the Nasdaq-100 is a huge badge of honor for tech firms, and it is very hard to imagine MicroStrategy ending up there if it not had been for co-founder (and currently executive chairman) Michael Saylor and his strong belief in and advocacy for Bitcoin since the firm’s struggling software business is reporting increasingly lower revenue and increasingly higher losses based on the most recent financial results. For Q3 2024, the firm recorded a revenue of $116.1 million and a net loss of $340 million. So, how come MicroStrategy has a market cap of nearly $98 billion? Well, that all comes down to the decision — announced in August 2020, to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a primary treasury reserve asset. This is also when it disclosed that it had bought 21,454 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. Under Saylor’s leadership and guidance, the firm has bet its future on Bitcoin and continuously kept accumulating Bitcoin. As of December 9, the firm owned 423,650 bitcoins (which has a current value of around $43 billion, which has been acquired for a total cost of around $25.6 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of BTC.

Title: Why more companies are looking to buy bitcoin

MicroStrategy's bet on bitcoin has fueled a wild rally in the shares of the business software company — and it's driving more companies to copy the strategy. MicroStrategy's crypto playbook has catapulted its stock up 501% this year. Though its core business is software, piling up an enormous trove of bitcoin has become its guiding star. Now, other firms are stocking up. Mimicking MicroStrategy's approach, corporate bitcoin adopters include the crypto firm Marathon Holdings and Japan's Metaplanet. Biopharma company Acurx Pharmaceuticals also recently announced the approval by its boar for a $1 million purchase. Though bitcoin holdings aren't unique to MicroStrategy, the move is generally rare for firms outside the crypto industry to invest. That could be changing, though, industry sources told Business Insider. "Speculative transactions, previously inherent in the crypto market, are becoming a thing of the past, and the ever-growing interest of institutions in creating reserves based on bitcoin confirms this," Gracy Chen, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, told BI. In a December note, Bernstein analysts suggested that bitcoin will replace gold as the world's premier "store of value" asset and become a standard holding in corporate treasuries. Chen noted that bitcoin has gained a reputation as a hedge against inflation and economic crises, which could be attractive to companies as the world grows more volatile. The argument is emerging more and more — recently, a think tank pushed for Microsoft to consider buying bitcoin for this reason, with a similar proposal being floated to Amazon shareholders. Of course, bitcoin's triple-digit rally this year also spurs dreams of hefty profit, with MicroStrategy's wild stock rally exhibit A. The firm has raked in tokens by selling interest-free convertible debt, which rewards the buyer if bitcoin keeps rising. The success of these has turbocharged its stock price. "At a bitcoin price of $97,400, the value of the bitcoins that the company has created this year is ~$7.7bn, and we believe it is important to note that it created that value without the capital outlays and operational costs associated with bitcoin mining," Benchmark Company managing director Mark Palmer wrote in November. But for firms trying to replicate this, caution is necessary here, Chen said. New entrants face a much steeper bitcoin price than when MicroStrategy started buying. Companies that buy bitcoin using leverage also expose themselves to heightened risks if bitcoin suddenly drops: while the crypto's price may erode, debt obligations do not. Though this same concern has crept up for MicroStrategy, Palmer told BI that the firm has survived previous sell-offs, and has diversified means of buying bitcoin. "If we were to see the price of bitcoin drop such that MicroStrategy was trading at a discount to its [net asset value], then it would be in a position to create shareholder value through share buybacks, and I think that's a big part of the flexibility the company has created," he said. Not all shareholders want to see companies jump on the crypto bandwagon. On Wednesday, Microsoft investors voted down the think tank proposal that pushed for the tech titan to buy bitcoin. Ahead of the decision, the board similarly recommended that shareholders reject the idea. This was expected, Chen said, as most Microsoft shareholders likely value the software giant's asset stability. "The company's investment in Bitcoin may mean additional risk in investing in MSFT, while many invested in MSFT as a predictable good business," she told BI, later adding: "For shareholders who build their own diversified portfolios, mixing assets like cryptocurrencies into corporate balance sheets can complicate the valuation of a company and distract from the core business objectives for which investors are buying its shares."

December 14, 2024 00:08 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 14 December 2024 — As of today, all regulatory closing conditions relating to the review of Novo Holdings A/S’s pending acquisition of Catalent, Inc. (Catalent), including expiry of the timing agreement in the US, have been fulfilled. Catalent is a global contract development and manufacturing organisation headquartered in New Jersey (US). The parties are now free to close the transaction, as well as Novo Nordisk’s subsequent acquisition of three Catalent manufacturing sites from Novo Holdings A/S. The agreement to acquire the three manufacturing sites was announced on 5 February 2024. For further information, please see the company announcement here. Novo Nordisk now expects the acquisition to be completed in the coming days. Upon completion, the acquisition is expected to impact the financial outlook as issued on 6 November 2024, with a low single-digit negative impact on operating profit growth and to negatively impact free cash flow with the 11.7 billion USD acquisition price. The ongoing share buyback programme of 20 billion DKK is not impacted. For 2025, the acquisition is expected to have a mid single-digit negative impact on operating profit growth. The acquisition will be mainly debt-financed, with interest payments negatively impacting net financial items. Novo Nordisk’s capital allocation priorities focus on internal growth investments, including supply chain expansions, dividends as well as external growth opportunities, including acquiring the three manufacturing sites. Consequently, Novo Nordisk is not expecting to initiate a share buyback programme in 2025. Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases, built upon our heritage in diabetes.

Title: Nasdaq announces MicroStrategy’s inclusion in Nasdaq-100, what’s next?

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article The Nasdaq-100 Index will welcome MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies, and Axon Enterprise as new members before market open on December 23, as announced by Nasdaq during its annual reconstitution on Friday. The three companies will replace Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna in the annual reconstitution of the index, which comprises 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. With a market value of $102 billion as of December 13, MicroStrategy is set to rank 40th on the Nasdaq-100. Entering the Nasdaq-100, MicroStrategy stands to attract approximately $2.1 billion from ETFs that directly track the index, which collectively manage around $451 billion in assets, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterated in a post following Nasdaq’s announcement. He added that the $2.1 billion buying estimate might be conservative as it excludes separately managed accounts, closed-end funds, and active strategies. This weighting equates to about $2.1b of buying via all the ETFs that track the index which have $451b collectively. We did not include SMAs or CITs or any active strategies so it could be a little more when all is said and done. @JSeyff — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 14, 2024 This influx of capital is projected to drive up MicroStrategy’s stock price and enhance its market visibility. Stocks typically see a rise in price following their inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. Bernstein analysts project MicroStrategy shares could reach $600 following its inclusion in the index, driven by the anticipated capital inflow from index-tracking investment funds. MicroStrategy has established itself as a major player in the Bitcoin market through its giant holdings. The company’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will likely accelerate its ambitious goal of accumulating $42 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next three years. As MicroStrategy’s stock price rises due to increased demand, the company will have greater financial flexibility to continue its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Michael Saylor-led company currently holds approximately 423,650 Bitcoin, valued at around $42 billion. The company has consistently expressed its intent to further increase its Bitcoin holdings, even at higher prices. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment makes its stock a proxy for Bitcoin. This means that owning MicroStrategy shares provides investors with indirect exposure to the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin was up slightly following Nasdaq’s announcement. It’s now trading above $102,000 million, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

The Nasdaq 100 comprises 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies in the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index. A stock's addition means that ETFs – including the highly popular Invesco QQQ Trust, which has $325 billion in assets – will become automatic buyers as well. Shares of the bitcoin proxy could be set to gain off the move. They're up more than sixfold this year, compared with bitcoin's nearly 140% gain in the same period. The change, which will become effective before the market open on Dec. 23, was announced Friday after the stock market close. MicroStrategy was widely telegraphed as a potential contender for membership by investors who were looking forward to the index's rebalancing this week. "This would lead to inclusion of MSTR in some of the largest ETFs such as QQQ (5th largest ETF) etc, leading to one-time fresh buying … and ongoing participation in future inflows," said Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, in a note this week ahead of the reshuffle. Additionally, "the market will likely set its sight on S&P 500 inclusion for 2025," Chhugani said. "Currently, due to profitability of its software business, it may be challenging to be considered for S&P 500 inclusion." The Nasdaq changes the constitution of the Nasdaq 100 index annually. The companies selected for inclusion are based largely on market cap rankings on the last trading day of November, which was Nov. 29 this year. Stocks must also meet eligibility requirements around liquidity and the free float percentage of their shares. MicroStrategy originally sold enterprise software, but the firm has increasingly become a bitcoin holding company. It first added bitcoin to its balance sheet in 2020, with Michael Saylor as CEO at the time, and has been leaning into that strategy in the years since. MicroStrategy now issues convertible notes to leverage its purchases, and its stock's daily trading sometimes looks like a more volatile version of bitcoin. The company now has a market cap of roughly $90 billion despite having less than $500 million in revenue over its previous four quarters, according to FactSet. Saylor told CNBC's "Squawk Box" earlier this month that he sees the company's role as "securitizing bitcoin." "Primarily, our job is to bridge the traditional capital markets that want bonds, or they want fixed income, or they want equity, or they want options, and we plug that into the crypto economy. And we use bitcoin as the vehicle to do that," said Saylor, who is now the company's executive chairman. MicroStrategy began cranking up its purchases after the U.S. presidential election. The victory of pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump — specifically his promise to establish a national strategic bitcoin stockpile — has propelled bitcoin to new all-time highs, achieved in part by the company's purchases. MicroStrategy now owns 423,650 bitcoins. It bought 149,880 of them in four different purchases over the past month, beginning Nov. 11. As part of MicroStrategy's hot streak this year, activists have been pushing bitcoin investing as an agenda item in shareholder meetings at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. Mining stocks like Mara Holdings have also begun employing Saylor's bitcoin yield strategy. Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise will also be joining the Nasdaq 100 later this month. Illumina, Moderna and Super Micro Computer will be removed from the index. Last year, the Nasdaq 100 added six companies in its annual reconstitution, including DoorDash. Five of those six stocks rose the Monday after the announcement, with an average move of 1.21%. —With reporting by Jesse Pound. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: MicroStrategy to Enter Nasdaq 100, Exposing Bitcoin-Linked Stock to Billions in Passive Investment Flows

MicroStrategy (MSTR) is set to soon be included in of the world's largest exchange-traded funds after becoming the first bitcoin-centric company to win entry into the Nasdaq-100 Index. The Nasdaq-100 Index tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange and is filled with dominant market names like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Costco. The price of bitcoin (BTC) added modestly to earlier gains, topping $102,000 in the minutes following the Friday 8 pm ET press release from Nasdaq announcing the inclusion. On Nov. 29, the day when the Nasdaq took a market snapshot in preparation for the index's annual rebalancing, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $92 billion. That would rank the Michael Saylor-led company as the 40th largest in the Nasdaq 100 and a likely weighting in the index of 0.47%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. As comparison, Apple — prior to this year's rebalancing — had the index's largest weighting at just under 9%; Qualcomm had the 20th largest weighting at just above 1%. The addition will exponentially increase the Nasdaq 100's exposure to bitcoin (BTC), of which MicroStrategy owns about $42 billion worth, and expose MSTR to billions in passive investment. ETFs tracking the Nasdaq 100 have more than $550 billion in assets under management, said Balchunas. Easily the largest is Invesco's QQQ Trust (QQQ) with more than $300 billion in AUM. “The inclusion of MicroStrategy entering the Nasdaq 100 is possibly the second biggest story of 2024, after the launch of the US spot listed ETFs,” said James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. “These funds are often buyers at any price level on a monthly basis which will add to another buyer of MSTR, when Michael Saylor continues to issue the at-the-market (ATM) offering, to dilute shareholders but will have a bigger base of buyers.” Balchunas' colleague James Seyffart cautions that there’s a chance that MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the index might be short-lived as the company could be re-classified as a financial firm in March since its value comes almost entirely from its bitcoin holdings and not the actual operating business. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Michael Saylor has even said previously that he plans to turn the company into a “bitcoin bank,” making it even less of a technology operation. “The game theory now sees the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY), the largest of all ETFs with about $650 billion in AUM, as maybe needing to include MSTR to rival their competitor," van Straten added. "Millions of investors will now have indirect bitcoin exposure adding to the flywheel effect." The re-shuffling of the Nasdaq 100 and consequently the QQQ and related ETFs will go into effect on Dec. 23.

Title: The long-shot plan to save TikTok from a US ban
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320722/frank-mccourt-project-liberty-tiktok-us-ban-bytedance
Time Published: 2024-12-13T23:26:28Z
Full Content:
By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. So far, ByteDance has shown zero willingness to spin off TikTok in the US. The Chinese parent company seems to be banking on the Supreme Court or President-elect Donald Trump rescuing the app before it’s banned next month. The obvious names that would would buy TikTok if they could — Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, etc. — are sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see what happens in the coming weeks. The clock is ticking. Congress just sent letters to Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook reminding them that they will be legally liable for continuing to host TikTok in their app stores after January 19th. Then there’s Frank McCourt, the real estate billionaire and former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. For months, McCourt has been very public about his desire to buy TikTok. He has ramped up his drumbeat since ByteDance recently lost its legal fight on appeal. This week, he pitched more investors on his Project Liberty plan to buy the app’s US operations. When I spoke with McCourt over Zoom in between those investor meetings, he told me he currently has roughly $20 billion behind him for a bid. He has asked Kevin Mayer, who was briefly TikTok’s CEO the last time it was almost banned from the US, to be involved, though Mayer hasn’t signed on. McCourt told me his team has talked to “most” of ByteDance’s biggest American investors and that they’re “very interested” in his plan. (Spokespeople for these firms either declined to comment or didn’t respond to my pings, and Mayer didn’t have a comment.) There are several reasons McCourt’s attempt to buy TikTok is a long-shot, the biggest being that, even if ByteDance wanted to sell, the Chinese government may not let it. Then there are the technical details of his proposal, which would see TikTok put on a decentralized protocol that is funded by McCourt and untested with a platform of TikTok’s size. For me, the biggest red flag of all is that there’s a cryptocurrency called Frequency tied to the project. McCourt has high-minded ambitions for how the internet should work that are in line with the rise of federated platforms like ActivityPub and Bluesky. He imagines TikTok offering a marketplace of user-created algorithms, much like Bluesky does today, and users having the ability to own their profiles. Keep reading for more from our conversation this week… The following Q&A has been edited for length and clarity. My understanding is there are multiple pieces of Project Liberty. You’ve got the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP) and then the TikTok bid, and they’re connected. It all seems a little bit afield from what you have historically done. Having seen the harms of social media and where the internet was going as it became highly centralized, I dedicated some resources to start a public policy school at my alma mater, Georgetown. I was perhaps naive in retrospect, but I thought that we could get the policymaking apparatus out in front of the problem and steer things in a better direction out of that school. Then I realized that the public policy making apparatus is no match for Big Tech, so I began to go back to my roots. My family has been building infrastructure for 131 years, so this actually isn’t very far afield from our core competency when you think about this not as software at the app layer, but as infrastructure at the base layer. I talked to a few brilliant computer scientists that we have in the company and put the task to them of solving this from an engineering perspective if you had no limitations. The answer came back that you would go ahead and create another protocol that would connect us, just like TCP/IP connects devices and HTTP connects data. Our goal here is bigger than buying TikTok. It’s reimagining how the internet works. Purchasing TikTok and moving 170 million people to a reimagined, upgraded internet would catalyze that alternative and compress time. Is this a financial endeavor or is this philanthropy for you? Do you see a return on investment here? I see it as both and we’ve been very careful to separate the two. Project Liberty has an institute, a 501(c)(3), that’s purely not-for-profit. DSNP has been gifted to the world. That is being supported by the institute. The layer-one blockchain, Frequency, is tokenized. The community will own the majority of the tokens but that will be a commercial endeavor. TikTok, when we buy it, will be a commercial endeavor. If you were given the opportunity to buy it but a condition was that you couldn’t do it on this protocol you built, would you still do it? Probably not because I don’t know how you would achieve the objectives we want to achieve, which is to be able to run the platform without the algorithm and give people ownership and control of their relationships. You need an implementation device to use DSNP. I would be totally open, however, if someone else built an alternative to Frequency. We’re looking to decentralize, not further centralize. Have you studied the fediverse: Mastodon, ActivityPub, and then also what Bluesky is doing? I admire all the people who are doing that because they are trying to improve the internet and respect individuals. A federated approach is very different than having a universal social graph that’s globally accessible. We’re saying that something has to change fundamentally with the internet. What Jay Graber is doing with Bluesky is great but you still have a Bluesky identity. You’re still on Bluesky and your relationships are on Bluesky. Let’s stipulate that it’s better but you’re still there, right? At some point maybe Jay is not there. Give me an update on the status of your investor pitch and how much money you have committed. People are super excited about this and capital will not be an issue at all. The issue is going to be what ByteDance does. We’ve been saying for over six months that we felt the government was going to win the case. I don’t think ByteDance’s appeal is going to be successful. This is going to be a shut-it-down or sell it scenario. Like President-elect Trump, I’d like to see it not banned. We’re not asking China for the algorithm. We’re not an antitrust threat. We’ll pass CFIUS vetting. We don’t need or want the algorithm. We have a clean stack where the user base can migrate. We don’t know what ByteDance is going to decide. We certainly hope they decide to sell and preserve some value for their shareholders. We’ll do it on terms that we think can be a win-win. China keeps the algorithm. US citizens are protected. The app stays alive. Is $20 billion the amount that you still have committed? That’s what we’ve got circled right now and that’s an order of magnitude what we think this is worth. Now, I say that with a huge caveat: we don’t know what ByteDance is selling. We think we have a very good idea of what the current numbers are, but it’s not like there’s a data room that ByteDance has set up and we’re inside of it. I think we have a good sense of what this would be worth if ByteDance keeps the algorithm and sells the user base and the content and the brand. There are three categories of investors. One group is the existing American companies that have invested in ByteDance. We’ve talked to most of them. They’re very interested, assuming ByteDance agrees to sell. They would either put more capital in or keep their capital in. A second category are people that are familiar with the asset because they’ve looked at it in the past. Some are looking at it for the first time. These are the large balance sheets that deploy big amounts of capital and they’re interested in what we’re doing. The third category is the bucket of cultural capital, people with influence who are interested in being a part of this and bringing their communities with them. When will you share who your backers are? We’ll be able to share once we know what ByteDance is doing. It makes no sense to be barking up the wrong tree here. You’ve had no conversations with ByteDance leadership, right? That’s correct. I reached out before the decision. They were not interested in speaking at that time. We’ll try it again. They know at this stage of the game that we exist, we’re interested, and we hope that there’s incoming at some point as well. But we respect their decision-making process. They’re going to decide what they think is best for their interests. Have you spoken to Trump or his team? We’re in the process of reaching out. I’ve heard President-elect Trump say he doesn’t want to see the app banned. I’m very interested in having that conversation once this gets sorted on the China side and they decide what they’re going to do. Are you concerned about other large would-be acquirers, like an Amazon, also circling TikTok? I don’t see the big incumbents being bidders here for a couple of reasons. One is antitrust, obviously. Secondly, imagine you were a tobacco company and you built a big business and then people started to get worried because people were getting sick and dying because of the addiction of cigarettes and carcinogens. If you bought a tobacco company after the surgeon general’s warning, then you were putting a target on your back because you were buying it with the awareness that your product kills people. The growth of these platforms happened really fast. Then we discovered that there are harms. Anybody buying TikTok and replicating the current design, which is to scrape peoples’ data, apply algorithms, and manipulate people, they’re buying this with their eyes wide open. So I don’t see a lot of bidders because people realize they’re just putting a target on their back. Let’s take this problem and actually use it to catalyze an upgraded internet. Then, a lot of the problems go away. A lot of the lawsuits go away. A lot of the harms go away. That’s Project Liberty. Hundreds of the world’s top researchers gathered this week in Vancouver, Canada for NeuralPS, one of the world’s top academic gatherings in the field of AI. I asked The Verge’s Kylie Robison (who just published a fascinating deep dive on the history and future of ChatGPT) what it was like being there on the ground: Are there any recurring themes you’ve been hearing in conversations? The “Is AI hitting a wall?” conversation came up sometimes, but this is not the place where people actually believe that. AI safety was something I wound up talking about a lot. A research topic that also came up a lot was what Fei-Fei Li focuses on, which is helping AI understand the world like we do in terms of physics and objects. That touches a bunch of cool things — robotics, agents, advanced reasoning. Which lab does everyone wish they worked at? This conference was filled with students from Waterloo and University of Toronto who basically want any AI job. (It was quite sweet sometimes watching those students corner an AI exec at a party.) If parties are any indicator, everyone wants to get as close to OpenAI as possible. This is a highly academic conference with lots of people just wanting to do good, deep research. What was the hottest party? The Midjourney party was 4x oversubscribed and researchers kept sending me the RSVP link. Everyone was asking about the secret OpenAI parties, though. There are plenty of interesting takeaways from Mustafa Suleyman’s recent Decoder interview with Nilay Patel. The Microsoft AI CEO doesn’t seem to agree with Sam Altman on the timing of AGI’s arrival, and he revealed that Microsoft won’t train its own frontier models when OpenAI is doing it for them anyway. He also takes some shots at Google’s management culture versus Microsoft’s, which I’m sure will cause some eyes to roll in Mountain View, given the way Suleyman excited. As a follow-up to this conversation, I recommend listening to Sayta Nadella’s interview this week with Brad Gurley and Brad Gerstner. Reading between the lines, it’s clear that there is ongoing tension between the level of compute Altman wants and what Nadella feels comfortable spending. For those closely following Nvidia’s stock price, Nadella also mentions that Microsoft no longer feels GPU constrained but rather constrained by the power requirements for its data centers.

Title: The year in money: inflation eased, optimism ticked upward

By Anna Helhoski, NerdWalletThe battle to get here was certainly an uphill one, but people are generally feeling better about the economy and their finances than they once did. On top of that, the economy has been easing into an ideal, Goldilocks-like position — not running too hot or cooling too quickly.Throughout 2024, consumer sentiment data showed people were fairly positive about the economy and their own finances, even if there’s remaining frustration over elevated prices compared to four years ago.Looking ahead, households are feeling more optimistic about their personal finances in the next year, as the share of those expecting to be in a better financial situation a year from now hit its highest level since February 2020.Combine positive personal vibes with a strong economic picture and it looks like 2024 wasn’t so bad for consumers, after all. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t bumps in the road or potential roadblocks ahead.To cap off the year, NerdWallet writers reflect on the top trends in personal finance and the economy this year — and what they think might be ahead in 2025.The economy steadily grewElizabeth Renter, NerdWallet’s economistWhat happened: In 2024, U.S. consumers have proven resilient following a period of high inflation and ongoing high interest rates. Wage growth has been strong, owing in part to rising productivity. This has driven robust spending throughout the year, which has kept the economy growing at a healthy pace. The labor market has remained steady, though cooler than 2023, and price growth continues to moderate towards the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation goal.

Inflation will continue to moderate and the labor market will remain relatively healthy, all due in part to continued slow and deliberate rate cuts from the Fed. However, there are risks to this path.Higher tariffs and tighter immigration policies are likely, but the extent of these changes are yet unclear. The potential policy scenarios are many, and the economic outcomes complex. Increased tariffs are generally inflationary, and stricter immigration policies could impact the labor supply and economic growth. Consumers and small business owners with their eyes to the new year should focus on the things within their control.Savings accounts offered high rates and returnsMargarette Burnette, consumer banking and savings writer What happened: High-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit offered elevated rates in 2024, rewarding savers with strong returns. Following the Federal Reserve rate cuts in the second half of the year, high-yield accounts had modest rate decreases, but they continued to outperform traditional savings accounts and CDs.What’s ahead: We’re watching for further Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could lead to more decreases in savings rates.Credit card debt hit a highSara Rathner, credit cards writer What happened: Credit card debt levels hit record highs, with consumers turning to credit cards to pay for necessities. While the economy is doing well, many individuals have struggled to make ends meet, as incomes haven’t kept up with certain costs.What’s ahead: We may see some policy and regulation changes with the incoming administration that could affect folks when it comes to credit cards, debt and consumer protections.Small business boomedRyan Brady, small business writer What happened: New businesses continued to blossom in 2024 as business applications remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Confidence in the future state of the U.S. economy also spiked after the presidential election, but that optimism was tempered by concerns over rising costs and labor quality.What’s ahead: All eyes are on the incoming administration as small-business owners brace for turbulence resulting from potential tariffs, tax policy changes and dismantled government regulations. We’re also watching the possibility of interest rate cuts in 2025 and small-business owners’ growing reliance on new technologies, such as AI.Home buying remained challengingHolden Lewis, mortgages writer What happened: Home buyers struggled with elevated mortgage rates, rising house prices and a shortage of homes for sale. On top of that, a new rule required buyers to negotiate their agents’ commissions.What’s ahead: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut short-term interest rates, but mortgage rates might not necessarily fall by a similar amount. Buyers will probably have more properties to choose from, and the greater supply should keep prices from rising a lot. Interest rates on home equity loans and lines of credit should fall, making it less expensive to borrow to fix up homes — either to sell, or to make the home more comfortable and efficient.The markets were a boon for investorsSam Taube, investing writer What happened: The stock market had a great year. The S&P 500 is up more than 25% due to falling interest rates, fading recession fears, AI hype, and the possibility of lighter taxes and regulations under the new administration. Cryptocurrency also saw big gains in 2024; the price of Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in December.What’s ahead: A lot depends on how fast the Fed reduces rates in 2025. Another key unknown is Trump’s second term. Regulatory rollbacks, such as those he has proposed for the banking industry, could juice stock prices — but they also could create systemic risks in the economy. His proposed tariffs could also hurt economic growth (and therefore stock prices). Finally, it remains to be seen whether trendy AI stocks, such as NVIDIA, can continue their momentum into next year. It’s the same story with crypto: How long will this bull market last?Premiums went up for home and auto insuranceCaitlin Constantine, assistant assigning editor, insuranceWhat happened: Many people saw their home and auto insurance premiums skyrocket in 2024. In some states, homeowners are finding it harder to even find policies in the first place. Meanwhile, life insurance rates have started to decrease post-pandemic. We also saw more insurers offering online-only policies that don’t require a medical exam.What’s ahead: Auto and home insurance costs will likely continue to rise, although auto premiums may not rise as dramatically as they have over the past few years. And if you’re in the market for life insurance, expect to see competitive life insurance quotes and more customizable policies.Lawsuits and uncertainty over student loan relief continuedEliza Haverstock, student loans writer What happened: Borrowers received historic student loan relief, but lawsuits derailed an income-driven repayment plan used by 8 million whose payments are indefinitely paused. Uncertainty will carry into 2025 as a result of the presidential administration change.What’s ahead: Trump has pledged to overhaul higher education and rein in student loan relief. The fate of the SAVE repayment plan, student loan forgiveness options, FAFSA processing and more remain in the balance.Traveling in style was all the rageMeghan Coyle, assistant assigning editor, travelWhat happened: People are willing to pay more for big and small luxuries while traveling, and airlines and hotels are taking note. Many airlines raised checked bag fees early in 2024, credit card issuers and airlines invested in renovated airport lounges, and major hotel companies continued to add luxury properties and brands to their loyalty programs.What’s ahead: Southwest will say goodbye to its open seating policy and introduce new extra-legroom seats, a major departure for the airline. Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines will unveil a unified loyalty program in 2025. Spirit Airlines may attempt to merge with another airline again after its 2024 bankruptcy filing and two failed mergers under President Biden’s administration. Travelers will find that they’ll have to pay a premium to enjoy most of the upgrades airlines and hotels are making.Dynamic pricing expanded its reachLaura McMullen, assistant assigning editor, personal financeWhat happened: This year, dynamic pricing expanded beyond concerts and travel to online retailers and even fast-food restaurants. This practice of prices changing based on real-time supply and demand received plenty of backlash from consumers and prompted the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how companies use consumers’ data to set prices.What’s ahead: Beyond an expansion of dynamic pricing — perhaps with added oversight — expect subscription models to become more prevalent and demand for sustainable products to grow.The car market came back for buyersShannon Bradley, autos writerWhat happened: New-car prices held steady in 2024 but remained high after a few years of sharp increases — the average new car now sells for about $48,000, and for the first time ever the price gap between new and used cars surpassed $20,000 (average used-car prices are now slightly more than $25,000). Overall, the car market returned to being in the buyer’s favor, as new-car inventories reached pre-pandemic levels, manufacturer incentives began making a comeback and auto loan interest rates started to decline.What’s ahead: The future of the car market is uncertain and depends on policies implemented by the incoming administration. Questions surround the impact of possible tariffs on car prices, whether auto loan rates will continue to drop, and if federal tax credits will still be available for electric vehicle buyers.Buy now, pay later grew in popularityJackie Veling, personal loans writer What happened: Buy now, pay later continued to be a popular payment choice for U.S. shoppers, even while facing headwinds, like an interpretive ruling from the CFPB (which determined BNPL should be regulated the same as credit cards) and Apple’s discontinuation of its popular Apple Pay Later product. Large players like Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay continued to offer interest-free, pay-in-four plans at most major retailers, along with long-term plans for larger purchases.What’s ahead: Though more regulation had been widely anticipated in 2025, the change in administration suggests the CFPB will play a less active role in regulating BNPL products. For this reason, and its continued strength in the market, BNPL will likely keep growing.Inflation eased, finallyTaryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Easing inflation was a bright spot in 2024. In June, the consumer price index fell below 3% for the first time in three years. Consumers saw prices level off or decline for many goods, including for groceries, gas and new and used vehicles. But prices haven’t fallen far enough or broadly enough to relieve the pinch many households feel.What’s ahead: The new and higher tariffs proposed by the Trump administration could reignite inflation on a wide range of goods.Rents were still high, but price growth slowedTaryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Rent prices remain high, but annual rent inflation slowed significantly compared to recent years, staying around 3.5% for much of 2024, according to Zillow, a real estate website that tracks rents. A wave of newly constructed rental units on the market seems to be helping ease competition among renters and forcing landlords to offer better incentives for signing a lease.What’s ahead: If it continues, a softening rental market could work in renters’ favor. But construction is one of several industries that could see a shortage of workers if the Trump administration follows through on its promise to deport undocumented immigrants. A shortage of workers would mean fewer houses and apartments could be built.Trump won the election, promised tariffs and deportationsAnna Helhoski, news writer What happened: After a contentious presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump declared victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to lower inflation, cut taxes, enact tariffs, weaken the power of the Federal Reserve, deport undocumented immigrants and more. Many economists have said Trump’s proposals, if enacted, would likely be inflationary. In Congress, Republicans earned enough seats to control both houses.What’s ahead: It’s unclear which campaign promises Trump will fulfill on his own and with the support of the new Congress. He has promised a slew of “day one” actions that could lead to higher prices, including across-the-board tariffs and mass deportations. Most recently, Trump pledged to enact 20% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on China. He has also promised to extend or make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; many of its provisions expire by the end of 2025.Congress squabbled while consumer-first, antitrust efforts wonAnna Helhoski, news writer What happened: Fiscal year 2023-2024’s funding saga finally came to an end in March, then six months later, the battle to fund the fiscal year 2024-2025 began. The Biden Administration waged its own war against junk fees. Antitrust enforcers pushed back against tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta; prevented the Kroger-Albertsons merger; nixed the Jet Blue-Spirit Airlines merger; and moved to ban noncompete agreements. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as a challenge to abortion pill access. SCOTUS also overruled its landmark Chevron case, which means every federal regulatory agency’s power to set and enforce its own rules are now weaker.What’s ahead: The election’s red sweep means the GOP will control the executive and legislative branches of government. They’ll face the threat of at least one more potential government shutdown; a debt ceiling drama comeback; and the beginning of the debate over extending or making permanent provisions of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Regulatory rollbacks, such as those he has proposed for the banking industry, could juice stock prices — but they also could create systemic risks in the economy. His proposed tariffs could also hurt economic growth (and therefore stock prices). Finally, it remains to be seen whether trendy AI stocks, such as NVIDIA, can continue their momentum into next year. It’s the same story with crypto: How long will this bull market last? Caitlin Constantine, assistant assigning editor, insurance What happened: Many people saw their home and auto insurance premiums skyrocket in 2024. In some states, homeowners are finding it harder to even find policies in the first place. Meanwhile, life insurance rates have started to decrease post-pandemic. We also saw more insurers offering online-only policies that don’t require a medical exam. What’s ahead: Auto and home insurance costs will likely continue to rise, although auto premiums may not rise as dramatically as they have over the past few years. And if you’re in the market for life insurance, expect to see competitive life insurance quotes and more customizable policies. Eliza Haverstock, student loans writer What happened: Borrowers received historic student loan relief, but lawsuits derailed an income-driven repayment plan used by 8 million whose payments are indefinitely paused. Uncertainty will carry into 2025 as a result of the presidential administration change. What’s ahead: Trump has pledged to overhaul higher education and rein in student loan relief. The fate of the SAVE repayment plan, student loan forgiveness options, FAFSA processing and more remain in the balance. Meghan Coyle, assistant assigning editor, travel What happened: People are willing to pay more for big and small luxuries while traveling, and airlines and hotels are taking note. Many airlines raised checked bag fees early in 2024, credit card issuers and airlines invested in renovated airport lounges, and major hotel companies continued to add luxury properties and brands to their loyalty programs. What’s ahead: Southwest will say goodbye to its open seating policy and introduce new extra-legroom seats, a major departure for the airline. Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines will unveil a unified loyalty program in 2025. Spirit Airlines may attempt to merge with another airline again after its 2024 bankruptcy filing and two failed mergers under President Biden’s administration. Travelers will find that they’ll have to pay a premium to enjoy most of the upgrades airlines and hotels are making. Laura McMullen, assistant assigning editor, personal finance What happened: This year, dynamic pricing expanded beyond concerts and travel to online retailers and even fast-food restaurants. This practice of prices changing based on real-time supply and demand received plenty of backlash from consumers and prompted the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how companies use consumers’ data to set prices. What’s ahead: Beyond an expansion of dynamic pricing — perhaps with added oversight — expect subscription models to become more prevalent and demand for sustainable products to grow. Shannon Bradley, autos writer What happened: New-car prices held steady in 2024 but remained high after a few years of sharp increases — the average new car now sells for about $48,000, and for the first time ever the price gap between new and used cars surpassed $20,000 (average used-car prices are now slightly more than $25,000). Overall, the car market returned to being in the buyer’s favor, as new-car inventories reached pre-pandemic levels, manufacturer incentives began making a comeback and auto loan interest rates started to decline. What’s ahead: The future of the car market is uncertain and depends on policies implemented by the incoming administration. Questions surround the impact of possible tariffs on car prices, whether auto loan rates will continue to drop, and if federal tax credits will still be available for electric vehicle buyers. Jackie Veling, personal loans writer What happened: Buy now, pay later continued to be a popular payment choice for U.S. shoppers, even while facing headwinds, like an interpretive ruling from the CFPB (which determined BNPL should be regulated the same as credit cards) and Apple’s discontinuation of its popular Apple Pay Later product. Large players like Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay continued to offer interest-free, pay-in-four plans at most major retailers, along with long-term plans for larger purchases. What’s ahead: Though more regulation had been widely anticipated in 2025, the change in administration suggests the CFPB will play a less active role in regulating BNPL products. For this reason, and its continued strength in the market, BNPL will likely keep growing. Taryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Easing inflation was a bright spot in 2024. In June, the consumer price index fell below 3% for the first time in three years. Consumers saw prices level off or decline for many goods, including for groceries, gas and new and used vehicles. But prices haven’t fallen far enough or broadly enough to relieve the pinch many households feel. What’s ahead: The new and higher tariffs proposed by the Trump administration could reignite inflation on a wide range of goods. Taryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Rent prices remain high, but annual rent inflation slowed significantly compared to recent years, staying around 3.5% for much of 2024, according to Zillow, a real estate website that tracks rents. A wave of newly constructed rental units on the market seems to be helping ease competition among renters and forcing landlords to offer better incentives for signing a lease. What’s ahead: If it continues, a softening rental market could work in renters’ favor. But construction is one of several industries that could see a shortage of workers if the Trump administration follows through on its promise to deport undocumented immigrants. A shortage of workers would mean fewer houses and apartments could be built. Anna Helhoski, news writer What happened: After a contentious presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump declared victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to lower inflation, cut taxes, enact tariffs, weaken the power of the Federal Reserve, deport undocumented immigrants and more. Many economists have said Trump’s proposals, if enacted, would likely be inflationary. In Congress, Republicans earned enough seats to control both houses. What’s ahead: It’s unclear which campaign promises Trump will fulfill on his own and with the support of the new Congress. He has promised a slew of “day one” actions that could lead to higher prices, including across-the-board tariffs and mass deportations. Most recently, Trump pledged to enact 20% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on China. He has also promised to extend or make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; many of its provisions expire by the end of 2025. Anna Helhoski, news writer What happened: Fiscal year 2023-2024’s funding saga finally came to an end in March, then six months later, the battle to fund the fiscal year 2024-2025 began. The Biden Administration waged its own war against junk fees. Antitrust enforcers pushed back against tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta; prevented the Kroger-Albertsons merger; nixed the Jet Blue-Spirit Airlines merger; and moved to ban noncompete agreements. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as a challenge to abortion pill access. SCOTUS also overruled its landmark Chevron case, which means every federal regulatory agency’s power to set and enforce its own rules are now weaker. What’s ahead: The election’s red sweep means the GOP will control the executive and legislative branches of government. They’ll face the threat of at least one more potential government shutdown; a debt ceiling drama comeback; and the beginning of the debate over extending or making permanent provisions of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Title: Broadcom's AI Chip Leadership Puts Pressure on Nvidia and Marvell, Analysts Say

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock surged Friday after it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter adjusted EPS results and raised its quarterly common stock dividend. The company reported a topline of $14.05 billion, up from $9.3 billion, compared to the analyst estimate of $14.57 billion. EPS of $1.42 missed the analyst consensus of $1.46. Also Read: T-Mobile’s Premium Valuation Prompts Downgrade As Growth Projections Decelerate: Analyst Broadcom expects first-quarter revenue of ~$14.60 billion, almost in line with the $14.61 billion consensus estimate. Multiple Wall Street analysts rerated the stock after the print: Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained Broadcom with a Buy and raised the price target from $240 to $250. B of A Securities analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Broadcom with a Buy and raised the price target from $215 to $250. JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur maintained Broadcom with an Overweight and raised the price target from $210 to $250. Rosenblatt: Broadcom came in with a slight beat on continued AI and networking momentum and some VMWare first-quarter pushouts. Non-AI dynamics continue to demonstrate modest cyclical recovery. The Street will pivot on management’s disclosure of the line-of-sight AI serviceable available market (SAM) at its current custom ASIC (XPU) 3 hyperscaler customers of $60 billion—$90 billion by 2027, up from the $15 billion—$20 billion level in 2024. Interestingly, Broadcom has two new potential engagements that could eventually match the size of the current three. The AI 3-year outlook supports the ~60% CAGR of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) TAM of $500 billion for the 2027 and 2028 timeframes. Management implied strong prospects for maintaining AI custom ASIC leadership and share gains over Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. Broadcom already has working custom ASIC 3nm silicon that will ship this Spring, well ahead of anybody in the market. While custom ASIC sister Marvell Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL) is also in the 3nm race, it is roughly a year behind Broadcom. Mosesmann’s fiscal 2025 revenue and adjusted EPS estimates remain unchanged. B of A Securities: The rerating reflects Broadcom’s expanding custom-chip (ASIC) AI, surging AI opportunity, and potential to maintain a position at large wireless customer Apple. Near-term results were inline, though the pushout of some software deals from the fourth to the first quarter helped Broadcom guide the first quarter inline versus concerns of missing due to seasonal headwinds, the analyst said. Arya projected fiscal 2025 revenue of $61.1 billion (prior $59.3 billion) and EPS of $6.27 (prior $6.00). He expects fiscal 2026 revenue of $70.2 billion (prior $68.5 billion) and EPS of $7.50 (prior $7.31). His forecast implies a growth trajectory of about 15% sales and 20% EPS over the next three years across a diversified silicon and infrastructure software base. Based on Broadcom’s leading capabilities and IP in leading-edge logic, networking, memory, and interface design, Arya projected its AI sales to grow from $12 billion in the current year to about $30 billion by calendar 2027. However, Arya noted an upside to a 30% EPS CAGR towards $11-$12/share by calendar 2027, assuming AI sales get to $53 billion instead, based on Broadcom maintaining its current 70% share of a larger $75 billion SAM. There could be further upside since, per Broadcom, the stated range is only for its current three customer’s “line-of-sight” intention to each build 1 million unit custom accelerator (XPU) clusters requiring an 80% and 20% mix of compute and networking. JP Morgan: Broadcom delivered solid fourth-quarter quarterly results on continued strong sequential growth in its AI semiconductor segment, which offset lower software revenues. For the first quarter, Broadcom guided revenues in line with consensus expectations and better than market expectations on sustained strong AI demand and software revenue acceleration. The fiscal 2024 AI revenues were $12.2 billion, up 3 times year-on-year. Sur expects them to grow to $17 billion-$18 billion (+40% Y/Y) in fiscal 2025, given continued strong cloud and hyperscaler capex spending trends with a focus on AI infrastructure build-out and second-half ramp of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google’s next-gen TPU v6 3nm AI accelerator ASIC. More importantly, Broadcom expects the AI SAM opportunity for its three existing cloud/hyperscalers to accelerate, driven by continued substantial investments in multi-generational XPU road maps and larger cluster sizes. Even applying a more conservative market share assumption, Sur noted that Broadcom’s AI business is growing at a 40%- 50%+ revenue CAGR over the next several years. In the near term, despite a product handoff from the TPU v6 inference chip at 5nm to the TPU v6 training chip at 3nm, Broadcom is still guiding for sequential growth in its AI revenues for the first quarter. The TPU v6 3nm training chip will likely move into a high volume ramp in the second half of next fiscal year, and this one SKU Sur noted can drive $8 billion+ for Broadcom in fiscal 2025. Given its portfolio breadth, diversification, and product cycles, Broadcom continues to drive a stable revenue growth profile even during macro volatility. Broadcom generated strong free cash flow for the year, which resulted in an 11% dividend increase. Sur projected fiscal 2025 revenue of $62.7 billion and EPS of $6.50.

Title: Hyundai CEO vows the ‘best is yet to come’ with new EVs and advanced tech arriving soon

Despite an impressive year in 2024, Hyundai Motor Group chairman Euisun Chung told employees that even more is on the way — and it’s coming very soon. With new EVs and advanced tech launching, Hyundai’s chief said, “The real best is yet to come.” Hyundai Motor Group, including Kia and Genesis, is having a big year. Global sales are on track for another record-breaking performance. According to the company’s CEO, Hyundai is just getting started. On Thursday, during a town hall meeting at the company’s advanced new innovation center in Singapore, Chung told executives and employees, “Our journey has been amazing so far, but the real best is yet to come.” Hyundai opened the new smart facility last November to build custom EVs. Buyers can personalize their vehicles from home. You can even book a test drive on the company’s 675-yard (618-meter) rooftop sky track to get a better feel for the car. In Hyundai’s words, the innovation center “provides unprecedented ways for EV buyers to interact with their vehicles and the Hyundai brand.” The facility is filled with robots that carry out around 50% of the tasks. Custom-built EVs, like the IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6, and autonomous robotaxis are currently built at the facility. Now, Hyundai is expanding the “Software Defined Factory (FSD)” to other key regions. Chung said the AI, IT, and robotics used in Singapore will “gradually expand to domestic and overseas EV-only factories, including Hyundai Motor Group Meta Plant America.” Hyundai began production at its massive new EV plant in Georgia in October, after the first US-made IONIQ 5 rolled off the assembly line. The updated 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 features a bigger battery with more range and a sleek new design. It even comes with an NACS port for charging at Tesla Superchargers. Hyundai will build its first three-row electric SUV, the IONIQ 9, alongside it, which will roll out next year. Hyundai is coming off its best sales month ever in the US, its most important market. However, the company expects to become even more prominent with advanced new locally made models. It's pretty easy to get behind a company that is trying to produce great value vehicles like Hyundai, and ramping up their EV production as the market adjusts. I only wish Toyota was this aggressive and enthusiastic about making EVs. The record sales are “driven by the strong performance of our EV and hybrid vehicles,” Hyundai Motor America CEO Randy Parker explained. Parker added excitement is building for the US-built IONIQ 9, and “we can’t wait to bring it to market.” Hyundai’s EV sales were up 77% in the US last month. With nearly 5,000 units sold, the IONIQ 5 had its best sales month ever, just as 2025 models arrive at dealerships. And it’s not only in the US. Hyundai will introduce the new tech to its dedicated EV plant in Ulsan and a complete knock down factory in Saudi Arabia as it looks to expand its global footprint. With the new 2025 IONIQ 5 arriving at dealerships, Hyundai is offering clearance prices on 2024 models. The 2024 Hyundai IONIQ 5 is available to lease for as low as $199 per month while they are still in stock.

Title: Ozempic could be linked to a common cause of sudden blindness, another study finds
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-naion-eye-risk-study-1851720823

Read more: What’s ahead for weight loss drugs in 2025, according to Noom’s CEO Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+0.72%) blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic may have a potential link with an eye condition that causes vision loss, according to a non-peer reviewed study published Thursday on medRxiv. Diabetes patients using Ozempic were found to be over twice as likely to develop a rare eye condition known as NAION compared to those taking other diabetes medications, according to researchers who analyzed years of patient data from Denmark and Norway. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Still, the study determined that the overall incidence of the condition was exceptionally low, with just 1.4 additional cases per 10,000 patient-years of observation — calculated as the number of patients multiplied by the years they were monitored — among those taking Ozempic compared to users of other diabetes medications. If the risk remains consistent over time, a type 2 diabetes patient taking Ozempic for 20 years would face a 0.3% to 0.5% likelihood of developing NAION, according to the study. The findings for Wegovy — the company’s weight-loss drug that shares the same active ingredient as Ozempic — were inconclusive due to an insufficient number of patients in the analysis. Wegovy didn’t launch in Denmark until 2022 and in Norway until 2023. NAION is a condition in which blood flow in the optic nerve — a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the back of the eye to the brain — is reduced leading to sudden and irreversible blindness. The condition is the most common optic nerve disease in the United States, affecting up to 10 out of 100,000 older Americans every year, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. This study follows another one from earlier this year that also found a link between semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and NAION. “Given the well-established effects of semaglutide in managing both diabetes and obesity, it is crucial to weigh the potential risk of NAION against the substantial therapeutic benefits of semaglutide,” the researchers wrote. “Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously,” a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told Quartz in an emailed statement. The company said it had reviewed all available data on NAION in relation to its semaglutide products, including scientific literature, non-clinical studies, clinical trial results, post-marketing reports, and the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). This review found no evidence of a causal link between semaglutide and NAION. The company also clarified that NAION is not listed as a known side effect for its branded semaglutide products including Ozempic and Wegovy, according to their official labels. Additionally, after a review of this new study, Novo Nordisk reached the opinion that “that the benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains unchanged.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Why AMD Is a Much Stronger Investment than Intel (INTC)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. I used to be bullish on semiconductor designer and manufacturer Intel (INTC), but following the board’s decision to remove the CEO, I’m left uncertain about the company’s future. Instead, semiconductor designer AMD (AMD) is firing on all cylinders, with robust management and a fortified market position. As a result, I’m bullish on AMD and think it can generate a reliable 60% or more total price return in the next 24 months. Discover top-rated stocks from highly ranked analysts with Analyst Top Stocks! Easily identify outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of Intel, was ousted from his position on December 1, 2024, causing a downgrade in my rating for its stock from a Buy to a Hold. The board lost confidence in his ambitious and costly turnaround strategy, much of which depended on developing a robust advanced semiconductor manufacturing division called Intel Foundry Services. This vital direction was meant to help the West protect itself from the concentrated advanced chip manufacturing operations in Taiwan, which is close to authoritarian China. However, the board concluded that his plans were not delivering results quickly enough to address Intel’s financial struggles and competitive pressures. Indeed, during Gelsinger’s tenure, Intel’s market value significantly declined, falling to less than 30 times that of Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s strongest chip designer. Another way of looking at it is that Intel stock dropped more than 60% under Gelsinger’s tenure. Therefore, it’s understandable why the board was not pleased. However, tackling both advanced semiconductor manufacturing and competitive chip design was never going to be easy. Maybe management, led by Gelsinger, bit off more than it could chew, but a critical weakness in Western geopolitics remains. The world relies on Taiwan’s TSMC (TSM) for manufacturing 92% of advanced semiconductors. Not only does Gelsinger’s ousting and the uncertainty of the direction the company will take next spell trouble for Intel investors, but it also leaves the U.S. and the West vulnerable in the long term if the company decides to scrap its foundry plans. Many investors, including myself, are hoping the company will sell Intel Foundry Services to an entity that can focus wholeheartedly on fortifying Western semiconductor manufacturing interests. Previously, when I analyzed Intel, I considered it to offer a compelling 18-month value opportunity based on momentarily depressed sentiment. However, given that the board has now ousted the CEO (who had the most semiconductor experience of anyone in the company—the board has several members with no semiconductor experience), the near-term value thesis has become uncertain. As a result, I have downgraded my rating from a Buy to a Hold. My valuation model for Intel currently shows a negative margin of safety of -1.04%, based on a 2026 revenue estimate of $59.5 billion, a 2026 EBITDA estimate of $16.36 billion, and an EV-to-EBITDA terminal multiple of 8.5 (which reflects increased sentiment as the company enters a profit-harvesting phase in the near future). The result of my model shows a 2026 enterprise value of $139.05 billion and a present-day intrinsic enterprise value of $116.23 billion, compared to a current enterprise value of $117.45 billion. My intrinsic enterprise value is calculated using a discount rate of 9.4%, approximately equal to the company’s weighted average cost of capital. On Wall Street, Intel has a consensus Hold rating based on one Buy, 22 Holds, and six Sells. The average INTC price target of $24.43 per share indicates 19.05% upside potential over the next 12 months, reflecting that the near-term value thesis may remain intact. However, I am less convinced that the board and its new additions will be able to steer the ship to prosperity. See more INTC analyst ratings In contrast to Intel, AMD has demonstrated remarkable resilience, stability, growth, and market leadership in the semiconductor industry, leading me to be highly bullish on the company. It has consistently prioritized technological advancements across high-performance computing, AI chip development, and gaming and consumer electronics. AMD has delivered year-over-year EBITDA growth of 47.05% compared to just 8.76% for Intel. AMD is experiencing high growth at the moment primarily due to its Data Center segment. In Q3 2024, Data Center revenue accounted for 52% of AMD’s total revenue, reflecting a 122% year-over-year increase. Management has forecast the company’s Q4 revenue to grow 22% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Given these remarkable results that prove operational efficiency and organizational order, AMD is simply much more compelling than Intel to invest in based on objective data. It’s worth considering that the semiconductor market is cyclical. Therefore, the major players like Nvidia and AMD are prone to a valuation collapse at some point in the next three to eight years, based on my analysis. This depends on how the demand from Big Tech companies for AI infrastructure evolves. Yet, at this time, there is no indication of a slowdown in the build-out of advanced data centers for AI. Therefore, I remain bullish on AMD for the foreseeable future. By December 2026, AMD’s total revenue is likely to be approximately $40 billion, based on my analysis. If the company maintains an EV-to-sales ratio of approximately 8.5 (which is the midpoint of its current forward and trailing 12-month ratios), the company will have an enterprise value of $340 billion.

Title: Why AMD Is a Much Stronger Investment than Intel (INTC)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. I used to be bullish on semiconductor designer and manufacturer Intel (INTC), but following the board’s decision to remove the CEO, I’m left uncertain about the company’s future. Instead, semiconductor designer AMD (AMD) is firing on all cylinders, with robust management and a fortified market position. As a result, I’m bullish on AMD and think it can generate a reliable 60% or more total price return in the next 24 months. Discover top-rated stocks from highly ranked analysts with Analyst Top Stocks! Easily identify outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of Intel, was ousted from his position on December 1, 2024, causing a downgrade in my rating for its stock from a Buy to a Hold. The board lost confidence in his ambitious and costly turnaround strategy, much of which depended on developing a robust advanced semiconductor manufacturing division called Intel Foundry Services. This vital direction was meant to help the West protect itself from the concentrated advanced chip manufacturing operations in Taiwan, which is close to authoritarian China. However, the board concluded that his plans were not delivering results quickly enough to address Intel’s financial struggles and competitive pressures. Indeed, during Gelsinger’s tenure, Intel’s market value significantly declined, falling to less than 30 times that of Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s strongest chip designer. Another way of looking at it is that Intel stock dropped more than 60% under Gelsinger’s tenure. Therefore, it’s understandable why the board was not pleased. However, tackling both advanced semiconductor manufacturing and competitive chip design was never going to be easy. Maybe management, led by Gelsinger, bit off more than it could chew, but a critical weakness in Western geopolitics remains. The world relies on Taiwan’s TSMC (TSM) for manufacturing 92% of advanced semiconductors. Not only does Gelsinger’s ousting and the uncertainty of the direction the company will take next spell trouble for Intel investors, but it also leaves the U.S. and the West vulnerable in the long term if the company decides to scrap its foundry plans. Many investors, including myself, are hoping the company will sell Intel Foundry Services to an entity that can focus wholeheartedly on fortifying Western semiconductor manufacturing interests. Previously, when I analyzed Intel, I considered it to offer a compelling 18-month value opportunity based on momentarily depressed sentiment. However, given that the board has now ousted the CEO (who had the most semiconductor experience of anyone in the company—the board has several members with no semiconductor experience), the near-term value thesis has become uncertain. As a result, I have downgraded my rating from a Buy to a Hold. My valuation model for Intel currently shows a negative margin of safety of -1.04%, based on a 2026 revenue estimate of $59.5 billion, a 2026 EBITDA estimate of $16.36 billion, and an EV-to-EBITDA terminal multiple of 8.5 (which reflects increased sentiment as the company enters a profit-harvesting phase in the near future). The result of my model shows a 2026 enterprise value of $139.05 billion and a present-day intrinsic enterprise value of $116.23 billion, compared to a current enterprise value of $117.45 billion. My intrinsic enterprise value is calculated using a discount rate of 9.4%, approximately equal to the company’s weighted average cost of capital. On Wall Street, Intel has a consensus Hold rating based on one Buy, 22 Holds, and six Sells. The average INTC price target of $24.43 per share indicates 19.05% upside potential over the next 12 months, reflecting that the near-term value thesis may remain intact. However, I am less convinced that the board and its new additions will be able to steer the ship to prosperity. See more INTC analyst ratings In contrast to Intel, AMD has demonstrated remarkable resilience, stability, growth, and market leadership in the semiconductor industry, leading me to be highly bullish on the company. It has consistently prioritized technological advancements across high-performance computing, AI chip development, and gaming and consumer electronics. AMD has delivered year-over-year EBITDA growth of 47.05% compared to just 8.76% for Intel. AMD is experiencing high growth at the moment primarily due to its Data Center segment. In Q3 2024, Data Center revenue accounted for 52% of AMD’s total revenue, reflecting a 122% year-over-year increase. Management has forecast the company’s Q4 revenue to grow 22% year-over-year to $7.5 billion. Given these remarkable results that prove operational efficiency and organizational order, AMD is simply much more compelling than Intel to invest in based on objective data. It’s worth considering that the semiconductor market is cyclical. Therefore, the major players like Nvidia and AMD are prone to a valuation collapse at some point in the next three to eight years, based on my analysis. This depends on how the demand from Big Tech companies for AI infrastructure evolves. Yet, at this time, there is no indication of a slowdown in the build-out of advanced data centers for AI. Therefore, I remain bullish on AMD for the foreseeable future. By December 2026, AMD’s total revenue is likely to be approximately $40 billion, based on my analysis. If the company maintains an EV-to-sales ratio of approximately 8.5 (which is the midpoint of its current forward and trailing 12-month ratios), the company will have an enterprise value of $340 billion. Its current enterprise value is $204.99 billion, so an allocation today could render approximately a 65% total price return in two years based on my forecasts. On Wall Street, AMD has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sells. The average AMD price target of $184.33 per share implies 42.34% upside potential over the next 12 months, strongly supporting my independent analysis and personal Buy rating for the stock.

Title: OpenAI’s Sam Altman to Donate $1 Million to Trump Inauguration

Altman joins Meta and Amazon in making big pledges towards the president-elect’s inauguration bash OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is planning on donating $1 million to president-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, Fox News reported Friday. Altman’s gift comes after Trump already banked two major tech donations this week, with Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and Amazon both donating $1 million toward Trump’s inauguration. Altman’s contribution is different than the other tech giants, though, in that he’s personally making the donation, not the company he runs. “President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,” Altman said in statement to Fox News. The donations come as Big Tech has looked to build a good rapport with Trump heading into his second term. Trump reportedly met with Sundar Pichai, the head of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, on Thursday, and he’s planning on meeting with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos next week. Pichai on Friday told Semafor he’s interested in being part of an artificial intelligence version of the “Manhattan Project” under Trump. “I think there is a chance for us to work as a country together,” Pichai told the outlet. “These big, physical infrastructure projects to accelerate progress is something we would be very excited by.” And when it comes to Trump’s relationship with tech, his bond with X and Tesla boss Elon Musk is the most obvious. Musk donated more than $100 million to help Trump beat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election via his America PAC, the pro-Trump political action committee he launched. The world’s richest man — who has seen Tesla’s stock price surge 73% since Election Day — made several campaign appearances alongside Trump in the weeks leading up to the election. Earlier this week, following Tesla’s big stock rally and a new valuation for SpaceX, his rocket company, Musk’s net worth surpassed $400 billion.

Title: Why Is Costco Stock Up 2x S&P 500 This Year?

Note: Costco FY’24 ended on September 1, 2024. RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA - JULY 11: In an aerial view, the Costco logo is displayed on the exterior of a ... [+] Costco store on July 11, 2024 in Richmond, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Warehouse club operator Costco (NASDAQ: COST) stock is up 52% since the beginning of this year, almost 2x the return of the S&P 500 over the same period. In comparison, Costco’s peer Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) stock has swelled about 80% over the same period. Another competitor is having a good year, too. See What’s Happening With Amazon Stock? So what’s happening with Costco stock? Costco reported earnings and intraday (Dec. 13) is up 1.5% near $1000 per share. Costco beat both on top and bottom lines in its fiscal first quarter, which ended November 24. The retailer reported $4.04 (up 13% year-over-year) in earnings per share on $62.15 billion (up 8% y-o-y) in revenue. The market was anticipating $3.79 and $62.08 billion, respectively. Comparable sales for the total company (and U.S.) increased 5.2% y-o-y. Traffic rose 5.1% globally and 4.9% in the U.S. In addition, the company’s average ticket was up 0.1% worldwide and 0.3% in the U.S., including the negative impact of gas deflation and foreign exchange rates. Costco has shown a consistent performance at driving revenue, coupled with its dedication to enhancing customer experience, reflecting its ability to thrive in the ever-changing retail landscape. Several club stores have been opened in the U.S. and the company is well-positioned for continued growth overseas, including in China. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Despite the pandemic and inflationary pressures, the business has grown strongly. It should be noted that Costco makes a majority of its profits from its membership income, so comparable sales growth isn’t as important for it as it is for other retailers. In Q1, membership fee income of $1.2 billion was 8% higher than the prior-year period. This quarter marked the full impact of the 8.3% fee increase which took place on September 1, 2024. The cost of a premium membership increased to $130 from $120 and the maximum annual 2% reward for its executive membership rose to $1,250 from $1,000. Also, the annual charge for its basic membership fee grew to $65 from $60. Costco usually increases its membership fees every five years and the last hike was seen in 2017. Inflation over the past two years may have contributed to the seven-year gap this time. Admirably, COST stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 49% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. The retailer ended the first quarter with 77.4 million paid household members, up 8% y-o-y, and 139 million cardholders, up 7%, with continuing growth throughout the previous quarters. In terms of renewal rates, at the Q1 end, its U.S. and Canada renewal rates were 92.8%, down 0.1% from the Q4 end. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, also down 0.1%. The company’s renewal rates are seeing some impact from higher growth in digital sign-ups, which renew at a slightly lower rate than the base as a whole. A high renewal rate not only ensures a steady stream of revenue from membership fees but also increases the lifetime value of each customer, thereby boosting overall profitability. We need to monitor this metric when calculating Costco’s long-term growth potential. We have revised COST’s valuation to $973 per share, based on a $18.07 expected EPS and a 53.9x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2025 - slightly below the current market price. We forecast COST’s Revenues to be around $273 billion for the fiscal year 2025, up 7% y-o-y. The stock’s current valuation at 54 times earnings is much higher than the 25 to 30 P/E range before the pandemic, which means investors could see a couple of scenarios play out. There is the possibility that the shares could decline until the valuation falls in line, especially if a recession sinks the broader stock market. Alternatively, the stock may oscillate as earnings grow and valuations catch up. High inflationary pressures on food still burden consumers, so retail companies like Costco will benefit as cost savings are passed to customers. Costco also began selling gold in August 2023 and silver in late January of this year. The company prices the product attractively, providing members gold at ~2% above spot prices before a 2% cash back reward for executive members and another 2% cash back for those with the Citi card. It is also helpful to see how its peers stack up. Check out how COST’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Title: Broadcom stock soars 20% as AI demand powers the company to a $1 trillion market cap

Broadcom (AVGO-4.91%) has surpassed the $1 trillion market cap for the first time after it reported a 220% jump in artificial intelligence revenue. The chipmaker’s shares were up by about 20% during Friday morning trading, pushing its market cap to $1.02 trillion. Broadcom stock is up by about 10o% so far this year. The San Jose-based company reported revenues of $14.05 billion for the fourth quarter ended in November — a 51% increase from the previous year. Net income was $4.32 billion — a 23% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, revenue in Broadcom’s semiconductor solutions group, which develops its AI chips, rose 12% from the same quarter last year to $8.23 billion. “Semiconductor revenue was a record $30.1 billion driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion,” Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement. “AI revenue which grew 220 percent year-on-year was driven by our leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio.” On the company’s earnings call, Tan said Broadcom sees “our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.” He added that “specific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to develop their own custom AI accelerators.” Tan said Broadcom is developing AI chips, which it refers to as XPUs, with three of its hyper-scale customers, and that the company expects each customer to deploy one million AI chips in networked clusters by 2027. This could lead the total market opportunity for its XPUs and other AI networking to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal year 2027, Tan said. Broadcom set revenue guidance at $14.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025.

Plus: Inside The Food Industry’s Biggest Buyback Of 2024 Good morning, BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is now making the case for bitcoin in your traditional 60/40 investment portfolio. In new research from its Investment Institute, BlackRock analysts recommend that bitcoin, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of such portfolios. That would give the cryptocurrency, with a market cap of about $2 trillion, a risk level similar to companies like Nvidia, Amazon or Apple. Still, bitcoin is incredibly volatile, dropping as much as 70% in a year, so the analysts found that weighting it higher than 2% gets exponentially risky. Let’s get into the headlines, Illustration by Emily Scherer for Forbes; Photo by Chakkapong Khachonchit/Getty Images An underworld of sex workers, drug dealers and gamblers use Venmo to run their operations, most of which fly under the radar of law enforcement among millions of Venmo users. It is extremely difficult to estimate how much of Venmo’s total transactions are generated from vices, but Forbes estimates the underground economy on Venmo to be between $1 billion and $2 billion annually. In a rare 2024 tech IPO, ServiceTitan went public Thursday, closing 42% above an already higher-than-anticipated list price of $71, valuing the business at $8.9 billion by the end of day. Its public debut is a boon for a tech IPO market that has been relatively slow since the frothiness of 2021, when a wave of companies like Robinhood, Bumble and Duolingo went public. The Avalanche Foundation raised $250 million via a private token sale for its blockchain platform, a big-ticket round that had largely gone extinct during crypto winter. The Ethereum rival already has $3 billion in capital in its treasury, but its cofounder Emin Gün Sirer said the main goal “was to get alignment and incentivize the right kinds of partners to build with.” Shares of Photoshop maker Adobe plummeted 14% Thursday after lowering its revenue forecast for the current fiscal year, despite reporting record revenue and earnings. Adobe outperformed Wall Street’s projections four of its quarters of 2024, but its stock has fallen 18% this year as the company has estimated slower revenue growth. Andrejs Zavadskis for Forbes Pawel Chudzinski, now the cofounder of venture fund Point Nine Capital, got in on the ground floor of Berlin’s burgeoning startup scene. He now tops Forbes’ Midas List Europe, a ranking of the continent’s best venture capital investors, thanks to a string of smart early bets on British fintech phenom Revolut (which raised in August at a $45 billion valuation), blockchain analysis tool Chainalysis (now valued at $8.6 billion) and healthcare booking unicorn Docplanner. Almost half of the female students at a small private high school in Pennsylvania were the victims of AI-generated pornography, the largest-known instance of deepfake pornography made of minors in the U.S. “The trauma that they have endured in learning that their privacy has been violated in this manner is unimaginable,” District Attorney Heather Adams said. Two teenage boys, both minors, have been criminally charged in the case. Donald Trump was named Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” following his election win, the second time the publication has named the president-elect for the title. “Since he began running for president in 2015, perhaps no single individual has played a larger role in changing the course of politics and history than Trump,” editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs wrote. President Joe Biden granted clemency to 1,500 people on Thursday, the most in a single day by any president, two weeks after controversially pardoning his son Hunter. Reports also suggest Biden is considering preemptive pardons for several people Trump may target after he takes office, including people like Rep. Adam Schiff and former Rep. Liz Cheney, both of whom served on the House Jan. 6 committee, as well as Anthony Fauci. Meta donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, just weeks after its CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago in an apparent bid to mend a tense relationship for years. The New York Times previously reported that Trump’s Inaugural Committee was offering special access to donors who either contribute $1 million or raise $2 million, including tickets to inaugural events. Amazon is also reportedly planning to donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, and founder Jeff Bezos is set to have dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago next week. Hot Ones host Sean Evans BuzzFeed sold First We Feast, the studio that produces the popular Hot Ones interview show where celebrities eat increasingly hot chicken wings, for $82.5 million to a group of investors. First We Feast will operate as an independent company and plans to expand into new areas, including “new platforms, live events, and talent acquisition,” First We Feast CEO Chris Schonberger said in a statement. A court recently ruled that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) must get approval from the SEC to move forward with its expedited proceeding to expel Utah penny stock clearing firm Alpine Securities from membership. The move hamstrings one of the most prominent financial regulatory bodies in the U.S., especially at a time when the incoming Republican administration has pledged large-scale deregulation across industries. Courtesy of Mr. Yoshida's TOPLINE The label of Mr. Yoshida’s Japanese-style barbecue sauce features a photo of its charismatic founder in his signature look: a cowboy hat, glasses, and a wide, yee-haw smile. The joy emanating from his grinning, floating head is a key part of the image that Yoshida has fostered over the past four decades as his brand grew. “That history of a great American dream is still surviving in this country,” says Junki Yoshida, who recently turned 75. “It’s me.” The optimism belies what has been a sweet and sour ride for Yoshida. After the Kyoto-born entrepreneur moved to Seattle at 19, his family renounced him. So a soupçon of revenge stirred into the recipe when, in 1982, he started creating a sauce in his Oregon basement—inspired by what his mother had sold at her restaurant in Japan. The eponymous brand he launched grew into a major success—with sales of $25 million before the U.S. distribution rights were acquired in 2000 for $24 million by the American food giant Heinz (now Kraft Heinz). And then a business that had commanded 26% of America’s total teriyaki sales slowly got killed over the past two decades. But Yoshida didn’t let that end his story. His repurchase of Mr. Yoshida’s was the most significant food buyback of 2024—and the early success of its return to Costco, Sam’s Club, Safeway and Albertsons, as well as its first-ever launch on Amazon, has paved the way for Mr. Yoshida’s to regain its position as a major player in the condiments industry. WHY IT MATTERS “Heinz destroyed Yoshida’s brand,” Yoshida says with the same grin featured on his labels. “I wanted to start over again.” MORE The Secret Sauce Behind This $350 Million Japanese Barbecue Sauce?

The TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans. This crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. 💰 Aly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes… but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one. Also: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning Thousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem. This ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. 😮 I'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.) Low key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. 🍿 That said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's. If you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. 👋 I'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer. Also: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead I've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. 🚀 Needless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses. BTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts. All that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. 😅 The TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. 😤 Here is the recap: Deadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension). Consequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned. Reason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government. TikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. 🙃 On December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban. In response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban. As of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain. In addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. 😱 TikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. 😳 Meta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money. Also: Want analytics for your Threads posts? Meta is testing the feature now For advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks. To understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible. There are two main stages of awareness: Intent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you… you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward. Discovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery. Discovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly. Stay with me; you need to understand this to see the void… ⏳ TikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there. Also: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today Since TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers. What's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers. Without TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. 🥺 The obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. 🏆 Google is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine. Yeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine. Amazon also stands to benefit. TikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful. Also: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead Overall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people. I know what you are thinking: "You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more." And I feel strongly about that. However, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. 🔒 Looking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day. ByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. 📉 But guess who's probably low-key pissed about this? Shopify! Shopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. 🤝 TikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales. TikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions. All I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. 🤔 If you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you. The obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem. The real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it. Here's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience. I've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs. The pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. 📢 What does that mean? Think about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform. If you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn. As someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. 🥴 As a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry. As a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out. As a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price. As a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld. As an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it. That said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote… "It's not happening to you. It's happening for you." 🤗 As cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times. 😇 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you. P.S. 📩 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

Title: 2025 tech job market statistics and outlook

Olivier Le Moal - stock.adobe.co Once booming, the tech market has been unsteady since the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent layoffs at major tech giants, such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta. Add in the exponential growth of AI and automation, and it's no surprise the tech job market has been roiled over the past few years. As technology advances and companies attempt to keep pace amid constant volatility, it begs the question: Will the uncertainty of the tech job market -- slow job growth, continuous layoffs and skill shortages -- continue into 2025? Here are some statistics that clarify the tech job market in 2025. Tech jobs in the U.S. are projected to grow much faster than average, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association's (CompTIA) 2024 "State of the Tech Workforce" report. The report projected tech job growth from 6 million in 2024 to 7.1 million in 2034. According to research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, computer and IT occupations are expected to grow much faster than average from 2023 to 2033, with a projected 356,700 job openings annually. By 2026, the IT skills shortage will become a significant problem for most organizations globally, resulting in $5.5 trillion in losses, according to an IDC survey of North American IT leaders. Organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry predicted the skills shortage might leave as many as 85 million unfilled tech-related jobs by 2030. The IT skills shortage may already be here. No longer a looming issue, AI and other technologies continue to advance faster than workers and organizations can react. Staffing firm Robert Half reported that 95% of tech leaders who responded to its survey currently face challenges finding skilled workers. The Linux Foundation reported that a growing number of organizations, in response to technological advances and a tough labor market, are investing internally to close skill gaps rather than hiring new talent or consultants. Organizations continue to prioritize upskilling, reskilling and cross-skilling to meet their needs. After all, the half-life of technology skills is as short as 2.5 years, according to Harvard Business Review. The World Economic Forum, back in October 2020, noted that more than half of workers require skilling of some type by 2025 due to rapid technology advancements. According to Indeed's "Tapping Into Today's Tech Talent" report from October 2024, Python is the most in-demand skill in job listings, followed by experience with AWS, which enjoyed the largest growth in demand in the last year, as well as Oracle, Java and JavaScript. PyTorch, Rust, TensorFlow, Flutter and Dart were listed as other fast-growing areas. Xamarin, Erlang, Azure and iOS faced the biggest declines in demand, according to the report, with Erlang among the list of dying programming languages. Skillsoft's "2024-25 IT Skills and Salary Report" stated the average worldwide salary for IT professionals has increased nearly 5% since last year. North America recorded the highest average salary of $113,211 in comparison to three other regions: Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; and Asia-Pacific. C-level IT executives earned the highest salaries, according to the report, followed by IT architecture and design, and then cloud computing. In North America, the highest salaries are in the IT software sector. Meanwhile, IT professionals in the education sector reported the lowest average salary. LinkedIn's November 2023 "Future of Work Report: AI at Work" highlighted the ever-increasing demand for AI skills as organizations integrate AI into their business practices. Other hiring platforms concur. Indeed's Hiring Lab reported a 30-fold increase in generative AI-related jobs from January 2023 to February 2024, though they still make up a relatively small part of total jobs. That is changing as organizations focus on AI skills entering 2025. A ResumeTemplates.com survey found that 87% of leaders who plan to hire list AI experience as valuable for job seekers. Plus, AI skills benefit current employees. For example, in its 2025 salary guide, Robert Half reported that 44% of organizations boost pay for workers with AI and machine learning skills. CBRE, a commercial real estate services and investment firm, found tech industry hiring is slowing. Nontech industries hire more tech talent than tech industries, a first in the CBRE "Scoring Tech Talent" report's 11-year history. While the tech industry added nearly 29,000 tech talent jobs in 2023, the report noted professional and business services, excluding tech, netted almost 50,000 jobs, followed by roughly 45,000 in the transportation, warehousing and wholesale sectors. Layoffs, rampant in the tech industry since the pandemic, aren't stopping. TrueUp's layoff tracker reported more than 1,000 rounds of layoffs in 2024, affecting nearly 700 people per day. Continuous layoffs parallel an uptick in unemployment for tech workers. According to CompTIA's "Tech Jobs Report", in June 2024, unemployment for IT professionals reached 3.7%, the highest mark since August 2020. To combat hiring challenges, organizations are deprioritizing experience to help find and hire tech talent faster, according to Robert Half's 2025 salary guide. Additionally, the salary guide found technology leaders are taking other measures to attract top candidates, including 45% of leaders who've decided to increase pay.

There are two main stages of awareness: Intent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you… you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward. Discovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery. Discovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly. Stay with me; you need to understand this to see the void… ⏳ TikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there. Also: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today Since TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers. What's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers. Without TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. 🥺 The obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. 🏆 Google is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine. Yeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine. Amazon also stands to benefit. TikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful. Also: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead Overall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people. I know what you are thinking: "You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more." And I feel strongly about that. However, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. 🔒 Looking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day. ByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. 📉 But guess who's probably low-key pissed about this? Shopify! Shopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. 🤝 TikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales. TikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions. All I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. 🤔 If you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you. The obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem. The real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it. Here's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience. I've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs. The pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. 📢 What does that mean? Think about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform. If you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn. As someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. 🥴 As a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry. As a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out. As a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price. As a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld. As an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it. That said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote… "It's not happening to you. It's happening for you." 🤗 As cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times. 😇 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you. P.S. 📩 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

Title: The TikTok ban is worse than you think and will cost Americans billions - what you need to know

The TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans. This crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. 💰 Aly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes… but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one. Also: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning Thousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem. This ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. 😮 I'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.) Low key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. 🍿 That said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's. If you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. 👋 I'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer. Also: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead I've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. 🚀 Needless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses. BTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts. All that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. 😅 The TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. 😤 Here is the recap: Deadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension). Consequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned. Reason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government. TikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. 🙃 On December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban. In response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban. As of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain. In addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. 😱 TikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. 😳 Meta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money. Also: Want analytics for your Threads posts? Meta is testing the feature now For advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks. To understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible.

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics In a record breaking year for US stocks, two stats are ringing alarm bells. For the first time in more than 20 years, the major US index — the S&P 500 is experiencing what market watchers call “bad breadth”. The run in US stocks has been remarkable. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters. Get the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox. Barring a big sell-off before the end of the year, the S&P 500 is on track to show a more than 25 per cent return, if dividends are included. The S&P 500 achieved a similar return last year. A 50 per cent gain over two years is extraordinary. The long-term average annual return for the S&P 500 is around 10 per cent. These gains have been driven largely by the so-called “Magnificent Seven”: Tesla, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia. All these companies have benefited from the seemingly limitless promise of artificial intelligence. Trump’s election also put a rocket up stocks, with investors feeling that the Donald’s low regulation, low tax promise will juice earnings. In market parlance, the index is being boosted by what is called a momentum trade – otherwise known as FOMO. American retail investors haven’t been as bullish on US stocks in 40 years. Sixty per cent expect stocks to rise over the next 12 months. You can see why they are are, with the median holding of a stock portfolio rocketing to $250,000 compared to 150,000 just 18 months ago. But while retail investors are FOMOing into equities, those actually running the companies appear to be getting out. The number of corporate executives selling down their shares has reached the highest level in 20 years. According to Bloomberg data, there are six times as many executives selling their company stock as there are those buying it. And another key metric suggests that smart money is rolling out of their holdings, while the overall market is melting higher. For the last nine days, more stocks in the index have fallen than risen. The last time that the market saw consecutive declines of that nature was back in 2001 in the days after 9/11 ,in 1998, when the market eventually crashed 22 per cent, and in 1996 when the market dropped 11 per cent. It makes the US market a dangerous place to be when there are more declining stocks than advancing, particularly given how much the S&P 500 has bounced on weak fundamentals since Trump. Investment bank Macquarie thinks that the US market is “overly bullish” and is advising clients start looking at defensive stocks. “We see surprises turning negative in January,” MacBank wrote to clients. The big market gains may still hold if the US consumer continues to spend. So far they haven’t disappointed, with American shoppers increasing their spend by 3 per cent over the three months to October. Add in the prospect of rate cuts, and rising wages and disposable income may rise further. But there are Trump and Elon sized clouds on the horizon that may change the consumer spending picture. If Trump adds more tariffs, that will make goods more expensive, not only reducing sales but potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to raise rates to contain inflation. At the same time, the Department of Government Efficiency is looking to rip through the public sector and those public dollars eventually find their way into private pockets. Our market has not performed anything like the S&P 500. Our ASX 200 is up a mere 8.5 per cent year to date, compared to the 25 per cent on the S&P 500. Stripping out the miners, Macquarie finds the price to earnings ratio paid for the Australian market is near an all time high. Prices are at 22 times earnings, just under the post-COVID stocks boom when cheap money was flooding the economy and higher than the tech boom of the turn of the millennium. With stock prices so far ahead of earnings, something will eventually have to give. That’s why the US warning sign is becoming increasingly important because when the US sneezes, the world catches a cold. Macquarie has told clients it has already gone mostly defensive and advised them to pivot to health stocks like CSL and Resmed, real estate investment trusts and gold in advance of a US market meltdown. Even if the US maintains its momentum, Australian stocks don’t have much further to rise unless earnings start to catch up. For that to take place, interest rates here will have to fall. That’s why Macquarie takes the view that February is when investors should be looking to pick up any stocks like banks and tech companies that are linked to a cyclical economic upturn. It might be time to cash in and take a bit of pre-Christmas cheer, and keep an eye out for post-Christmas bargains.

Source: The Game Awards / The Game Awards 2024 The biggest night in video games, The Game Awards 2024, has arrived, plenty of big announcements were made (we will share those in another post), and plenty of awards were given out. Despite the bad news (layoffs and game studio closures), there is still plenty to celebrate this year in video games. As the night unfolded, the most significant award, Game of the Year, saw Astro Bot, Balatro, Black Myth: Wukong, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree contend for the prestigious title, which ultimately went to Astro Bot, capping Team Asobi/PlayStation Studios’ big night with four awards, including GOTY. This year’s darling, Balatro, the highly addictive poker roguelike and Metaphor: ReFantazio, also had a big night, winning three Game Awards.

Title: Watch These Broadcom Price Levels as Stock Soars on Strong AI Sales Growth

Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged in extended trading Thursday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected earnings and issued a rosy outlook amid robust AI-driven sales growth. The company said its fiscal 2024 AI revenue more than tripled, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. After-hours gains accelerated after CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the company’s earnings call that he anticipates significant AI opportunities over the next three years, adding that he sees accelerators and networking sales in fiscal 2027 ranging between $60 billion and $90 billion. Through Thursday's close, Broadcom shares had gained 64% since the start of the year. The stock rose 14% to around $206 in extended trading. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. Broadcom shares have consolidated within an ascending triangle since mid June, a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend. Indeed, the price sits poised to break out above the formation’s top trendline on Friday, setting the stage for further upside. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) gives a reading just above 50, confirming bullish momentum and indicating the shares have ample room to test higher prices as they move into price discovery. Let’s apply technical analysis to forecast a potential upside price target and also identify two key support levels that would likely attract buying interest during retracements. To forecast an upside target in the stock, investors can use the bars pattern tool, which analyzes prior trends to help predict future directional moves. When applying the tool to Broadcom's chart, we extract the stock’s trend higher from December 2023 to June this year and reposition it from the ascending triangle’s top trendline. This projects a longer-term upside target of around $315. We selected this prior move as it commenced following a decisive earnings-driven jump above a continuation pattern on the chart in December last year, similar price action to what looks likely after the company’s latest quarterly report. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch how the price reacts to the $185 level. This location on the chart would likely attract buying interest near the ascending triangle’s top trendline, which may flip from an area of prior resistance into future support. Selling below this level could see Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $140, an area where investors may seek buying opportunities near a horizontal line that connects a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between February and September.

SEBI comments on retail participation in algo trading SEBI to review, refine framework on algorithmic trading by retail SEBI: Broker to provide algo trading after exchange permission Sensex and Nifty rebound: Market recovers despite broad-based volatility The Sensex and Nifty fully recovered today after the steep intraday fall, reflecting broad-based volatility across the market. Overvaluation concerns relative to global peers, coupled with disappointing corporate earnings, have further spurred FII outflows. On Thursday, FIIs sold Rs.3,560.01 worth of equities which marks the continuation of the profit booking. The Indian rupee touched an all-time low against the US dollar on Thursday, driven by persistent foreign investor-led sell-offs in equities and a rise in onshore forward premiums, contributing to significant downward pressure on the currency. The trend aligns with global factors such as the strength of the US dollar, supported by robust U.S. economic data and recent election outcomes. Domestically, inflation remains a key worry. India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation came at 5.5% in November, within the RBI’s target. But, constant elevated food prices, raise concerns about potential delays in interest rate cuts by the RBI. All these factors collectively contribute to heightened market volatility, leading to inconsistent intraday trends with sudden fluctuations, which have made it difficult for traders to predict market movements and generate intraday profits.

In connection with this, the Company will also enter into an agreement for a proposed investment of approximately Rs 38.03 crores, through the subscription to equity shares of the SPV Ambuja Cements said it has commissioned and started power transmission from its 200 MW solar power project in Khavda . The balance 806 MW capacity from this project is at various stages of commissioning and expected to start transmitting in phases between March 2025 and June 2025. Positively impacting the Company’s EBITDA, this development leads to a 70% savings compared to current power cost, it said. Hindustan Aeronautics said a contract for procurement of 12 Su-30MKI aircraft along with associated equipment has been signed between Ministry of Defence and the company at an approximate cost of Rs 13,500 crore inclusive of taxes and duties. The aircraft would have an indigenous content of 62.6%, enhanced due to indiginisation of many components to be manufactured by Indian defence industry. These aircraft would be manufactured at Nasik division of HAL. The supply of these aircraft would enhance operational capability of Indian Air Force and strengthen defence preparedness of the country.

Wall Street also dropped, with the Dow logging its sixth straight loss due to inflation concerns, highlighted by a higher-than-expected US Producer Price Index for November.

Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs published their daily trades for Thursday, December 12th, 2024, showcasing a mix of strategic buy and sell decisions across various sectors. The most significant move from the day was the purchase of 5,080,595 shares of Archer Aviation Inc (NYSE:ACHR), with ARK's flagship ARKK ETF acquiring the bulk at 4,705,518 shares, followed by 288,154 shares through ARKQ ETF, and 86,923 shares via ARKX (NYSE:ARKX) ETF, amounting to a total dollar value of $37,545,596. On the selling front, ARK chose to offload shares of several companies, including a notable sale of 36,600 shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), spread across ARKK ETF with 34,823 shares and ARKQ ETF with 1,777 shares, totaling a value of $15,546,581. This continues ARK's recent trend of reducing its position in the electric vehicle giant, following a larger sale of 51,335 TSLA shares just two days prior. Another significant sale was of Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB), with ARKX ETF parting with 4,100 shares for a value of $95,735. This follows a substantial sell-off of 205,897 RKLB shares on Wednesday, signaling a potential shift in ARK's investment strategy regarding the aerospace manufacturer. ARK also engaged in smaller transactions, buying 28,823 shares of Symbotic Inc (NASDAQ:SYM) through its ARKQ ETF for a total of $768,997, and 56,338 shares of Tempus AI Inc (NYSE:TEM) across its ARKK and ARKG ETFs, totaling $2,433,238. The continued accumulation of TEMPUS AI INC stock is evident, with ARK having bought significant amounts consistently over the previous trading days. In addition, ARK sold 2,479 shares of Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:NYSE:VEEV) through its ARKG ETF, amounting to $579,714. This is part of a pattern of selling VEEV shares, with 4,660 shares sold earlier in the week. Investors following Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs will note the continued focus on innovative and disruptive companies, with adjustments to holdings reflecting ARK's active management approach and response to market dynamics.

Most every Saturday morning, Bob Snow slips on a short sleeve fishing shirt and khakis and ­putters out to his garage, a former airplane hangar within sight of the historic Rivanna River. “Thomas Jefferson used to cross right over there,” the Troy, Va., resident says, pointing across a wide field to a distant bank. Snow is 83. His white hair is close-cropped, and his smile is constant. He hums a lot. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more unlikely hardcore prepper anywhere in America. But inside the hangar, which serves as the warehouse for an organization called East Coast Preppers, Snow’s obsession becomes clear. Sturdy metal shelves fill its 7,000 square feet. They’re stocked floor to ceiling with backpacks, skillets, latex gloves, and binoculars. Freeze-dried celery, blueberries, oranges, and mango. Powdered eggs, powdered peanut butter. Portable showers and commodes. And everything is for sale. An anomaly? Hardly. Harsh pandemic realities brought doomsday into the daylight and put a sudden stamp of social approval on prepping. Today, it’s believed some 23 million adults in the United States are stockpiling their pantries and upping their survival skills. It’s big business, too, with billions spent annually on portable generators, gas masks, and windup radios. Some preppers are motivated by pragmatism and common sense, but others do a 180 into apocalyptic fear, fueled by a consuming zeal to protect themselves and their families. Christians are not immune from the hype. Depending on their eschatology, some foresee a coming calamity. Others question the desire to preserve what we have on earth when something much better awaits. By 10 o’clock at Snow’s place, more than 20 customers arrive with emptied car trunks ready for bulk buys. They’ve signed up for a class, too. This morning, it’s “Advanced Prepping.” Men and women, mostly over age 60, plop down in plastic lawn chairs set up in a room where three large dehydrator machines stand against one wall. As the crowd samples a salad made with freeze-dried chicken, a photo of then-President Joe Biden grins from a nearby dartboard. A sign on the wall says, “We now accept cash, gold, and silver.” Snow, standing at the front, starts the class by holding up a copy of One Second After, a popular novel about an unexpected electromagnetic pulse attack, or EMP. In the book, every modern electrical device is disabled, and the United States is effectively returned to the 19th century. Some in the crowd have read it. Others want to. They run the gamut, these preppers, from a grandma on her way to a soccer game, to a country singer hopeful on his way to Nashville. But they all seem to see eye to eye about one thing—­disaster is coming, and it’s high time to prepare. One woman, who only gives me her first name, Joyce, confides that she has a “room of doom” at her house. She keeps it supplied with canned goods, candles, whatever it would take to get through a long-term emergency. “I’ve been doing this for decades,” she admits sheepishly, going on to extol the virtues of rain barrels. In the back row, Jack, another cautious type who won’t give out his last name, says he’s unhappy with the country’s direction. That’s why he never misses one of these free weekend classes. He’s even taught his 10-year-old son how to sanitize water. But that’s nothing compared with a lady to his left. She quips that she recently cashed in her 401(k) and put it in precious metals. The surprising thing? No one within earshot even bats an eye. Bob Snow (right) and Gary Woodson take stock of the inventory at the East Coast Preppers warehouse. Photo by Kim Henderson TODAY’S PREPPER MOVEMENT traces its heritage to the Cold War of the 1950s, when the threat of atomic attack had schools conducting “duck and cover” drills, and families built bomb shelters in their backyards. During the Eisenhower administration, authorities even urged families to maintain a seven-day supply of food and water. They named the initiative “Grandma’s Pantry,” stressing that grandmas are always ready for emergencies. In the early ’60s, President John F. Kennedy upped the ante by calling for more than $200 million to construct public fallout shelters. The Department of Agriculture got busy, too. The result was a contribution to the doomsday diet—a bulgur wheat biscuit dubbed the “All-Purpose Survival Cracker.” Over the next decades, terms like retreater and survivalist entered the vocabulary. A survivalist honed pioneer skills and anticipated a combative style of preparedness. A retreater, in contrast, tried to avoid conflict and become invisible. As interest in survivalism grew during the 1980s, books and expos for its adherents became a multibillion-­dollar industry. Prepping took a hit when the scare over Y2K turned out to be false, but it wasn’t long before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 prompted authorities to instruct citizens to stockpile duct tape and have an evacuation plan. Hurricane Katrina, which left thousands of people without access to resources and supplies, furthered the cause. That was 2005. Five years later, polls showed half of all Americans had preparedness on the brain—a nearly 20% increase from pre-Katrina years. During that time period, Bob Snow was newly retired and spending time in Utah. As a Mormon, he was already steeped in preparedness. It’s part of a religious ideology that exalts being “anxiously engaged in a positive program of preparation.” In Utah, Snow saw the Mormon network of home storage centers and canneries. He visited prepper stores with their heirloom seed and water filtration systems. He determined his community back home in Virginia needed something similar. With his wife’s blessing, Snow cashed in a $30,000 life insurance policy and hauled two tractor trailers filled with survival goods across the country. East Coast Preppers was born. Shoppers in the warehouse today probably don’t know that history. No clues of a Latter-day Saints connection mark the aisles they’re cruising. Class is over, and some participants are looking for the new MadiDrop that Snow promoted. It’s a ceramic tablet that can treat up to 20 liters of water a day for 12 months, a utility he described as “revolutionary.” Snow is seated behind a table where his laptop is open and acting as a cash register. Business is steady. A regular he knows by name rolls up with three full shopping carts. In a matter of minutes, she shells out more than $1,000 for “supplies.” Prepping isn’t cheap. Americans spent an estimated $11 billion on emergency preparedness in 2022, and not just on the basics. They bought things like steel shelters, too. Texas builder Rising S Bunkers, which incorporates three crosses into its logo, is one of the best known in the business. Its 8-by-12 bunker starts at $50,900. A decontamination room costs $29,000 extra. Now that prepping is no longer shorthand for paranoia, big names like Walmart, Amazon, and Costco are jockeying for a share of the market, too. Costco’s one-month emergency food supply buckets are available by the pallet for $6,000, but you can’t accuse them of price gouging. That’s almost 14,000 just-add-water meals for less than 50 cents each. Pastor Tim Kinnard on his homestead in Sherwood, Ark., with a wood supply for the winter. Photo by Kim Henderson IN EARLIER TIMES, preparedness was a necessity, but prepping today is as much personal philosophy as emergency management. That personal philosophy usually includes strong views about self-sustainability, the kind that are in line with environmentalists on matters like rainwater harvesting and alternative energy. Preppers are also into gardening and canning, pursuits popular with millennials. But the prepper movement rarely gets linked to either of those groups. Instead, stereotypical preppers are considered too right wing and conservative, and they feel strongly about gun ownership. Or at least we think they do. There’s a secretive element that makes preppers hard to categorize and even harder to count. But since the pandemic, traffic to prepper websites and online communities has exploded, with some YouTube prepper channels boasting more than a million subscribers. Of course, the more sensational the episode titles—“You Have Been Warned,” “Get Your Money Out Now,” “We Won’t Survive This”—the more monetized the content creator. That’s where fear-mongering festers, and prepping becomes an identity instead of an activity. Although some Christian preppers embrace that apocalyptic vision, others forgo the fear. They just want to be prepared to help themselves—and others—when tough times come. Pastor Tim Kinnard lives just north of Little Rock, Ark., a state where the climate and cost of living, as well as less government regulation, have attracted an influx of preppers. One day a stranger knocked on his door. “He said they were moving from a more liberal context, a trend I’ve heard called the ‘Blue State Exodus,’” Kinnard recalls. “He wanted my advice on a good place to settle.” The man knew Kinnard from his online lectures and podcasts related to homesteading. That label—homesteader—is one Kinnard is more comfortable wearing than prepper, though his family is more prepared than most. His wife grows medicinal herbs, and his five children help raise pigs. Snap beans are ready in the garden. Their home, a Dutch Colonial, is extra-insulated and designed for good ventilation. Kinnard says their lifestyle is more about self-­reliance than stockpiling. A collected, rather than calamitous, approach. “Common, everyday preparedness is a wise thing, but what we know as ‘doomsday prepping’ isn’t Biblical unless what we mean by that is we’re preparing to meet the Lord Himself, and we are preparing others to be ready to meet the Lord, too,” Kinnard reasons. “That’s my pushback to the stockpiling-to-survive-the-end-of-the-world flavor of prepping, which many Christians are into.” And while Kinnard expresses dismay at preppers profiting from Armageddon announcements, he says he doesn’t trust the mainstream media to tell him everything that’s happening either. Instead, he tunes in on his ham radio and subscribes to specific podcasts and YouTube channels to hear reports from everyday people. “Whatever narrative you hear on the news isn’t necessarily what’s really going on,” Kinnard says. “So having free agents out there doing the same thing, telling us what’s really going on, we need that. But the motivation needs to be the facts, not ‘here’s a spin of those facts so I can get a couple extra dollars.’” Mark and Krista Lawley are part of the prepping set Kinnard considers non-alarmist. Since 2020, they’ve aired more than 470 episodes of their “Practical Prepping” podcast, all produced inside their North Alabama home recording studio. Some of their most popular include: “Items Preppers Should Carry Every Day,” “Eight Uses for Hydrogen Peroxide,” and “What Moms Need To Know About Home Invasions.” The Lawleys started their podcast after a trip to the grocery store during COVID-19. For the first time in her life, 62-year-old Krista was standing in front of empty store shelves. “I thought to myself, ‘This is Russia. We’ve got the money to spend and nothing to buy with it,’” she remembers. Both she and Mark have long believed in keeping their pantry full and their tools handy. His understanding grew while he was involved with the Birmingham Metro Baptist Association’s disaster relief team. During some of its missions, he saw tornado victims desperate for food. Many had only a few days’ worth on hand. “And the younger they are, the less they prepare,” Krista interjects, shaking her head. She says dependence on DoorDash and Instacart has trained a generation to think only of today. “These people don’t even have a can of soda in their refrigerator.” Each episode of the Lawleys’ podcast begins with a promise: no bunkers, no zombies, no alien invasions. They point out that a lot of people are prepping for postapocalyptic, total-grid-down societal collapse. Not them. “We don’t want to survive that,” Mark clarifies, a hint of a smile hiding behind his mustache. He adds that much depends on your eschatology. “Some Christian preppers think that the Church is going to go through the tribulation, but I believe the rapture is going to occur before the tribulation. What we prepare for are the practical things that happen to everyday people.” Pastor Tim Kinnard with herbs from the family garden. Photo by Kim Henderson IN ESSENCE, the Lawleys preach planning, and their message resonates with thousands of podcast listeners who, after COVID’s unrest and mandates, no longer trust in the government’s institutions to deliver in a crisis. Mark and Krista are members of a local faith-based prepping group born of a Sunday school class discussion. Members meet monthly and share their skills. Medical practitioners, lawyers, farmers, weapons experts, cattlemen. Some property owners simply offer space. “If disaster strikes and you need to get out of your urban setting, because it’s probably the most dangerous place you could be, they are offering a safe haven,” Krista explains. In contrast, she admits some preppers strive to lie low. They fear the world will beat a path to their door after a disaster and take what they’ve painstakingly stored. Krista is not for that attitude. “I think the Christian perspective is, we’re here for others.” When the Lawleys launched a private “Practical Prepping” Facebook group in January, it attracted nearly 25,000 members in just a few months. Although they enlisted help to moderate posts, they still spend about an hour each day responding to questions from fellow preppers around the world. Some countries have government-backed preparedness initiatives. In Sweden, prepping is viewed as a form of social responsibility, rather than an eccentric hobby. Students are taught essential survival skills and the importance of self-sufficiency. That’s been Bob Snow’s mission with East Coast Preppers for nearly two decades. At his age, though, tall shelves are hard to stock, and heavy equipment is a pain to unload. In May, he announced his retirement. His email to the East Coast Preppers community was short and to the point: He’s tired. But a paragraph near the end provided an additional tidbit. Until their warehouse doors close for good, weekly sales will continue to soar. Meanwhile, there’s an urgency in Snow’s voice as he tells his Saturday crowd that something significant happened the day before. The price of gold rose $60 an ounce. Then, almost as quickly, it went back down. He’s right. It was a record high at the time. But for a hundred years gold prices have fluctuated for all sorts of reasons—inflation, rising geopolitical tension, the amount of reserves, the cost of mining—with large swings in both directions. Still, Snow sees the recent spike as a sign of something worse coming. He definitely has the crowd’s attention, and he’s very convincing. “That just doesn’t happen,” he declares in an understated way, his eyes widening at the thought. “It was a red flag to me.” If you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.

Title: Kroger and Albertsons are spending billions to reward shareholders after their blocked merger

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Within a day of their $25 billion merger’s falling apart in court, Kroger and Albertsons were each planning to move forward with share repurchases to boost their stock prices and reward investors. America’s two largest grocery store operators had argued that they’d be better able to lower prices for shoppers by joining forces. Doing so, they said, would boost their negotiating power with suppliers and make it easier to take on much bigger retailers that compete with them in grocery sales, such as Walmart, Costco and Amazon. The Biden administration disagreed, with the Federal Trade Commission saying in a lawsuit countering the merger that the deal threatened to drive down workers’ wages and bargaining power and reduce industry competition, potentially pushing food prices higher. With the deal now dead, it’s impossible to know whether any of that would have happened. But U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson of Oregon sounded a note of skepticism, writing in her decision Tuesday that the chains’ promises to invest in lower prices were “neither merger-specific nor verifiable, so there is no guarantee” that shoppers would benefit. “The promise to make a price investment is not legally binding, and the Court must give limited weight to a non-binding promise made during these proceedings,” she said. A Superior Court judge in Seattle agreed with Nelson’s ruling and issued an injunction against the merger Tuesday. On Wednesday, Albertsons terminated the deal and sued Kroger, alleging its erstwhile partner didn’t do enough to secure regulators’ blessing. The drama unfolded just as the federal government released new inflation data for November showing grocery prices continue to inch higher. The costs of food eaten at home were 1.6% higher last month than they were the same time last year — a smaller uptick than the 2.7% annual inflation rate overall but accelerating 0.5% from the previous month after a 0.1% rise from September to October. Food prices tend to be volatile, but a broad range of items from produce to poultry notched increases in a wholesale inflation report that came in hotter than expected Thursday. Kroger on Wednesday reiterated its “commitment to lower prices,” saying it has invested billions in cost reductions over the past two decades. The chain also said it has spent $2.4 billion on pay hikes since 2018 and up to $3.8 billion in annual store improvements. Albertsons similarly promised to stay focused on “improving our value proposition with customers.” Neither company offered more details about their price-cutting plans, and Albertsons declined to comment further. Kroger said only that it provides value to customers “through competitive pricing, loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and a unique private label portfolio.” At the same time, both grocery chains said this week that they’d be pouring billions of dollars into moves that will benefit their shareholders. Kroger said it would repurchase $7.5 billion of its shares after a more than two-year pause, with $5 billion of that to be repurchased in an accelerated fashion — the same sum that Kroger estimated Wednesday it has spent to lowering prices over the past 21 years. Albertsons said it would repurchase $2 billion of its shares and increase the dividend it pays to owners of its stock by 25%. Stock repurchases — which reduce the number of shares available, driving up the value of those that remain — and dividend payments benefit all investors but especially those with the biggest stakes. Top shareholders typically include large Wall Street firms with the financial firepower to buy and hold millions of shares of publicly traded companies. Wall Street investment firm Cerberus Capital Management is by far the largest shareholder in Albertsons, followed by the Vanguard Group, which is the country’s largest mutual fund provider, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11.5 trillion under its supervision. Vanguard, BlackRock and billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate are the top owners of Kroger shares. “With both of these companies, there was a lot of hope [put] into the merger — that it was a way of generating growth. Those things aren’t happening now,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail consultancy GlobalData. Repurchasing shares could help inject more “optimistic sentiment” among investors, effectively reassuring them “‘we’ll generate good returns for you,’” he said. Kroger’s stock has been trading roughly 3% higher since Wednesday, while Albertsons’ had clawed back roughly all its losses following the ruling by late Thursday. In the meantime, consumer groups and labor advocates are hailing the blocked merger as a victory for shoppers and workers and as a vindication of the Biden administration’s antitrust efforts during its final weeks in office. The judges in the case “correctly saw the merger as a huge threat to the jobs and benefits of thousands of their members working for those chains and the communities in which they live,” said Seth Harris, a law and policy professor at Northeastern University and a former top labor adviser in the Biden White House. Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, said, “Combining two of the four largest food retailers would have also reduced consumer choice, leading to fewer alternatives to low-quality, ultra-processed foods.” “Unfortunately, the Trump administration seems unlikely to build on this important step towards restoring competition in food retail,” Gremillion said, citing President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Andrew Ferguson to replace Lina Khan atop the FTC. That’s a sign that “Big Food will only be getting bigger over the next four years,” he predicted. In a September campaign stop at a grocery store in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, Trump slammed the Biden-Harris administration over the costs of everything from eggs and cereal to ground beef. “Bacon is through the roof,” he said. Trump said Thursday at the New York Stock Exchange that increasing oil and natural gas drilling would help lower inflation, including for food prices, a promise energy analysts have viewed skeptically. But in a Time magazine profile published Thursday, he said of groceries: “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard.” CORRECTION (Dec. 13, 8:40 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misidentified Kroger’s and Albertsons’ largest shareholders. Cerberus Capital Management, not the Vanguard Group, has the biggest stake in Albertsons; Vanguard, not Cerberus, owns the most shares in Kroger.

European regulators are probing a discontinued advertising collaboration between Google and Meta Platforms, intended to target teenagers aged 13 to 17 on YouTube for the promotion of Instagram. Although the project has been terminated, the European Commission continues to investigate the details of this partnership. Finally, Piper Sandler has raised the target for Meta shares, recognizing the company's impressive earnings results for 2024 and advancements in artificial intelligence.

Title: BPCM Founders Describe How to Survive 25 Years in Fashion PR

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Torrential rains, an unauthorized database download and an indisposed A-list celebrity — the fashion publicists have seen a lot in their careers. Senior Editor After 25 years in business, Vanessa von Bismarck and Carrie Phillips have had their share of successes, laughs and struggles. To celebrate their company BPCM’s silver anniversary, they threw a party Wednesday night at SOBs, the Varick Street bar that was a popular haunt in the 1990s, and like them has stood the test of time. The duo connected in 1999, after von Bismarck gave up a commodities trading job in Europe to try to get into public relations in the U.S. Remembering first joining Nike Communications as an intern, von Bismarck said Phillips, who was her boss, asked another employee who von Bismarck was. After Phillips declared, “’She’s much too old to be an intern.’ Von Bismarck recalled with a laugh how she replied, ‘I can hear you.’” Related Articles Culture News Most Expensive Hermès Birkin Bags in the World: The Exotic Skins, Diamond Hardware and More Luxe Details Jewelry Think You Know the History of the Engagement Ring? Think Again, Says Author Marion Fasel After three months of working together at Nike Communications, von Bismarck suggested they partner in their own agency — using a cubicle in a friend’s office, which also had a fax machine. She informed Phillips that her father would invest $10,000 — most of which would be placed in the bank, “because we’re going to buy Bacon’s Media Directory,” [a book with journalists’ information.] With only one artist client committed for a Lot 61 event, Phillips said, “That’s not a business plan.” But the pair persevered, walking up and down Broadway “to tell everybody they were the new hot agency,” von Bismarck said. You May Also Like Opening Shanghai Tang (a deal that was secured through a friend of a friend that von Bismarck’s parents knew) made people take notice. Even more eyes were on the company, after Vogue’s Anna Wintour turned up for a fashion show for another client, the German brand Strenesse. After von Bismarck’s good friend Nadine Johnson sent Stella McCartney their way, BPCM was off to the races. Now with 100 employees and offices in New York, London and Los Angeles, BPCM’s client base includes Hermès beauty and watches, Tata Harper, Glossier, Tag Heuer, VW, Amazon Fashion, Alexandre Vauthier, Officine Générale, Ritz Carlton, the St. Regis, Aman New York and Dom Perignon, among others. As for memorable moments, Coty Inc.’s launch for Lady Gaga’s “Fame” fragrance at the Guggenheim Museum was pretty, indelible. Encapsulated in a glass dome throughout the party, the Grammy winner came out the structure for 15 minutes — of fame, get it. Phillips recalled chatting with a guest, who stopped mid-sentence to ask if Lady Gaga was peeing. “I said, ‘Well, there’s no toilet there.’ But yes she was peeing in a Champagne bucket.” Whether that was part of the installation was a matter of debate. Phillips said, “She knew she was going to do it, I feel. We just didn’t know she was going to do it.” Another hard-to-forget moment was a red carpet occasion for IWC in Los Angeles, where torrential rains caused the red carpet outside of the venue to float away. The pair have weathered it all though successfully. Von Bismarck, who has two sons, and Phillips, who has four children, agreed that as soon as an event ends, they forget all about it. “It’s like pregnancy amnesia,” Phillips explained. Almost going under twice — once 10 years ago and another time 15 years ago — taught them the importance of impressing upon young entrepreneurs the need to stay on top of cash-flow issues. The worst things like COVID-19, unexpected layoffs and clients’ comings and goings wind up being the best things because you end up with knowledge to avoid such challenges in the future, Phillips said. The company is seeing 20 percent annual gains on total billings, according to von Bismarck. Asked about the early challenges, von Bismarck recalled a placement for their first client, a pashmina company. “We convinced a newspaper to print a special offer for these pashminas on the front page with a phone number,” von Bismarck said. “The phone number was wrong, so we got fired from that one.” Another unexpected miss stemmed from allowing an employee to work remotely — long before that was routine — to care for an ailing parent. When it was time to return, the employee signed a long letter from Argentina with “’Eat, pray, love. à la,’ and her name,” von Bismarck said. “Then she downloaded our whole data base from a coffee shop in Argentina.” As always, BPCM just carries on, despite the seismic shifts in the media landscape, COVID-19’s impact on employees and clients’ needs. “Clients want so much more today. They want strategy and so much more,” von Bismarck said. Asked about their best moments, the founders said the fact that 90 percent of Wednesday’s attendees were former employees, including a few who traveled from California and Vermont. Phillips said, “There is a BPCM alumni hashtag, and people are in each other’s weddings. They still like to hang out and they like to hang out with us.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: No evidence Brian Thompson was set to testify against Nancy Pelosi | Fact check

Full Content:
A Dec. 7 Threads post (direct link, archive link) claims to share news of a connection between the victim of a high-profile shooting and the former Democratic Speaker of the House. “BREAKING: Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was set to testify against Nancy Pelosi for insider trading,” reads text in the image, which is a screenshot of an X post. The Threads post received more than 600 likes in five days. Similar versions of the claim circulated widely on X, Instagram and TikTok. More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page A spokesperson for California Rep. Nancy Pelosi said the claim is false. There is no credible evidence of an insider trading investigation into the former House speaker, much less that Thompson was scheduled to testify against her when he was killed. The claim that Thompson – who was fatally shot Dec. 4 on a Midtown Manhattan sidewalk – was scheduled to testify against Pelosi is false, Ian Krager, a spokesperson for the California congresswoman, told USA TODAY. There is no credible evidence indicating Pelosi is the subject of an insider trading investigation. No reputable media outlets have reported about it. Her name does not appear in a search of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s database of those charged between Oct. 1, 1995, and Sept. 30, 2024. Fact check: Image of job listing for UnitedHealthcare CEO after NYC shooting is fake Thompson, however, was accused of insider trading before his death, but there is no credible evidence Pelosi has any link to that allegation. He, along with parent company UnitedHealth Group and several other executives, were sued in May for alleged fraud and insider trading by the Hollywood (Florida) Firefighters’ Pension Fund. The lawsuit specifically accuses Thompson of selling more than $15 million of his UnitedHealth shares while the company was under a federal antitrust investigation that had not yet been disclosed to shareholders. Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey were among the more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers who signed a letter urging the SEC to investigate. Other versions of the claim that go into more detail unravel with a closer look at the facts. They attempt to link the February cyberattack that disrupted operations at UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Change Healthcare to a financial disclosure form filed by Pelosi. They falsely allege Thompson’s supposed testimony was scheduled after the congresswoman purportedly purchased $4 million worth of call options in a cybersecurity firm assessing the attack on the day it happened.No credible evidence or reports from legitimate media outlets exist about any investigation into Pelosi or supposed testimony scheduled for “a little over a week” after the Dec. 4 shooting. In addition, the versions of the claim that reference "the CEO of United" appear to confuse the company’s organizational chart. Thompson was the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the nation’s largest health insurer and one of two distinct units of conglomerate UnitedHealth Group. The firm that was attacked – medical records processor Change Healthcare – is part of the Optum Insight subsidiary of Optum, the corporation's other unit. The CEO of parent UnitedHealth Group is Andrew Witty – not Thompson, who had no publicly known role in the attack response. Witty, meanwhile, was front and center in the aftermath, testifying during an April Senate hearing that the company paid a $22 million ransom. The claim also gets key details wrong about the stock sale. According to the disclosure form, which members of Congress are required under the STOCK Act to file, the purchase was made not by Pelosi – who has said she does not own any stocks – but by her husband, Paul, a venture capitalist and investor. The form shows that on Feb. 12, the day hackers broke into the company’s electronic portal, Paul Pelosi bought between $500,001 and $1 million in call options – which give the buyer the right to purchase an asset at a set price within a set time frame – in cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks Inc. Then, on Feb. 21 – when the hackers activated the ransomware and when UnitedHealth Group said Palo Alto and other security firms teamed with tech experts to respond to the attack – Paul Pelosi purchased up to $250,000 in additional call options, far less than the $4 million referenced in the claim. USA TODAY previously debunked false claims that Nancy Pelosi bought stock in a cannabis company before President Joe Biden issued federal marijuana pardons and in a company that makes a drug used to treat radiation sickness. Spokespeople for the SEC and the Justice Department did not immediately return requests for comment. When contacted by USA TODAY, the Instagram user who shared the claim pointed to a blog post about the lawsuit filed by the firefighters’ pension fund that makes no mention of Pelosi. USA TODAY did not immediately receive responses from several other social media users who were contacted after sharing the claim. PolitiFact and Lead Stories debunked versions of the claim.

Title: U.S. stocks drop on hot PPI data

Friday, 13 Dec 2024 NEW YORK, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended lower on Thursday, as a hotter-than-expected producer price index (PPI) report overshadowed earlier momentum in tech shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 234.44 points, or 0.53 percent, to 43,914.12. The S&P 500 sank 32.94 points, or 0.54 percent, to 6,051.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 132.05 points, or 0.66 percent, to 19,902.84. Ten of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with consumer discretionary and health leading the laggards by losing 0.84 percent and 0.83 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, consumer staples bucked the trend by rising 0.18 percent. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Thursday, marking a symbolic gesture to the financial community as he prepares to assume office. Addressing a crowd of traders and business leaders, Trump vowed to deliver an economic boom, signaling his administration's commitment to pro-growth policies, "we're going to give tremendous incentive like no other country has," including by cutting taxes "very substantially." However, the PPI released on Thursday morning, which tracks wholesale prices, rose 0.4 percent in November, double the 0.2 percent gain economists had expected, according to a Dow Jones poll. The data signaled persistent inflationary pressures, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level in two weeks. Tech stocks led the day's decline. Nvidia dropped 1.41 percent, while Adobe tumbled 13.69 percent after issuing a weaker-than-expected outlook for 2025. Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon also traded slightly lower. This setback followed the consumer price index report earlier in the week, which aligned with economists' expectations and fueled optimism about a potential interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. Nevertheless, Thursday's PPI data introduced fresh uncertainties about the Fed's path forward. Also on Thursday, Stifel analysts project that the S&P 500 index will likely peak in the first half of 2025, driven by current market momentum and robust earnings. However, they warn of a subsequent 10 percent to 15 percent decline in the second half of the year. Stifel expects the Fed to pause its rate-cutting cycle, holding rates at 4 percent at its January policy meeting, posing risks to the markets around mid-2025. Report it to us.

Indexes closed lower on Thursday, dragged by tech stocks after the latest inflation report came in warmer than expected. Nvidia shares lost more than 1%, while Adobe stock fell almost 14% on a worse-than-expected revenue outlook. Tesla shares dropped 1.5% and climbing to record highs in the previous session. Google-parent Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon also ended lower. The Nasdaq retreated from its record above 20,000 set on Wednesday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 230 points. Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. closing bell on Thursday: The drop on Thursday comes as bond yields edged up after the latest producer price index report. The 10-year Treasury bond jumped six basis points to 4.332%. PPI showed wholesale prices rose 0.4% last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday. The data came in higher than consensus estimates of 0.2%. On an annual basis, wholesale inflation came in at 3%. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose in line with economists' expectations, rising 0.2%. The report marks the latest warm inflation reading after the release of the consumer price index on Wednesday, which showed consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in November. That's slightly higher than October's 2.6% rise. While the latest inflation updates showed price growth re-accelerating slightly, it wasn't enough to derail expectations for a rate cut at next week's Federal Reserve meeting. Investors see another cut as basically a given, though the outlook for further easing becomes less clear in January and beyond. If inflation stays hot, it could prevent the Fed's ability to continue its easing cycle. Jobless claims on Thursday showed 242,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That number comes in above forecasts of 220,000 and marks the highest level since early October.

Title: Google employees worried about possible layoffs in January

Sign Up! envelope_alt Get the latest Android News in your inbox every day arrow_right Sign up to receive the latest Android News every weekday: Only send updates once a week Android Headlines / Google News / Google employees worried about possible layoffs in January In recent years, Google has been under regulatory pressure across multiple business segments. Antitrust agencies have had its app store, ad tech, and web browsing businesses under scrutiny. The company has already faced unfavorable rulings and is currently awaiting definitive action on some of them. Amid this situation, a report suggests possible layoffs by Google in January 2025. Certain posts on Team Blind, an anonymous employee forum, sparked the concerns among Google employees. The posts claimed that Google plans to increase layoffs of “lower buckets”—that is, low-performing employees. The company has reportedly seen an 8% to 10% increase in this group of workers in its workforce and would opt to lay them off. The posts state that Google will begin the layoff process in January 2025. It’s noteworthy that none of the claims are backed by evidence, so you can take them with a grain of salt. However, the mere possibility that the posts are true has caused concern among employees. One of the factors that could influence possible layoffs at Google is its inability to match the stock market performance of other big tech companies in 2024. The regulatory pressure and antitrust cases that the firm has been facing have had a lot to do with this. At present, the Mountain View giant is still waiting to hear from judges whether it will have to sell Chrome. Under this uncertainty, investors think twice before putting their money in. Google already had rounds of layoffs in 2023, letting go of about 12,000 employees. This amounted to approximately 6% of its workforce, and the company faced backlash as a result. The Alphabet Workers Union asserted at the time that many employees were unaware of the reasons for their dismissal. Additionally, Brian Ong—Google’s vice president of recruiting—said that the company was “hiring less than we did a couple of years ago.” During Alphabet’s late third-quarter earnings call, Anat Ashkenazi—Alphabet’s CFO—said that they wanted to make changes to the company’s cost base. This does not necessarily imply that Google will implement rounds of layoffs, but those who are more concerned may interpret it as such after reading the posts suggesting it. Ashkenazi also revealed the company’s strategy regarding profits. It seems that there won’t be any major revolutions, or so her words suggest. Alphabet will “build on” previous efforts to streamline “operations across the company through the use of AI.” That means that the firm will maintain its focus on AI and will try to get the most out of its current developments. The bet on the AI segment is a long-term—and billion-dollar—investment. Employees from Google and other companies reacted to the posts on Team Blind. Team Blind is a board that allows employees to express their opinions and concerns anonymously, although they can verify who they work for. A Google employee says the firm’s output has increased to “an average of 500 code changes a year.” This would make it easier to list employees as “underperforming.” A Google Cloud team member said the division’s layoff rate is 6%. Meanwhile, employees at Amazon and Capital One said the layoff rate at their jobs ranges from 6% to 15%. Some Google workers also believe that being a “low performer” alone is not adequate grounds for dismissal. Google isn’t the only tech company to be embroiled in potential layoffs lately. In October, TikTok laid off hundreds of employees, while there are rumors that Tidal will say goodbye to a quarter of its staff. Copyright ©2024 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Costco (COST-0.65%) reported better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, fueled by solid revenue growth, strong e-commerce performance, and increased membership fees. The results extend a strong year for the retailer, whose shares have climbed nearly 50% in 2023, compared to the S&P 500's 27% gain. The stock closed at $988.39. The company beat Wall Street’s expectations. The retailer reported revenue of $62.15 billion, about $4.04 earnings per share. Analysts had forecast revenue of $61.98 billion, approximately $3.79 earnings per share. Membership fees also saw an increase, reaching $1.17 billion, up from $1.08 billion the previous year. Earlier this year, Costco announced a “Netflix-Style” crackdown on its membership and said it would raise the price of its Gold Star membership to $65 – a $5 bump that marked the first price hike since 2017. To offset the increase for new members, the company offered a special promotion in November for a one-year Gold Star Membership that came with a $45 Costco Shop Card. Executives said during the company’s earnings call on Dec. 12 that online sales were primarily driven by shoppers buying items like furniture, sporting goods, and hardware in bulk. E-commerce sales rose 13% when compared to the previous year, fueled in part by partnerships with Uber (UBER-0.24%) and Instacart. These partnerships have allowed customers to quickly purchase items – such as a blender – at a lower cost and have them delivered faster. Earlier this month, Costco recalled its store-branded Kirkland Signature organic eggs due to a potential salmonella contamination. The bacteria can cause serious infections, including stomach cramps and diarrhea, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, the company reported a 15% decline in e-commerce sales the month prior, which it said was due to holiday shopping being delayed by a week compared to typical patterns. During that time, Costco pulled nearly 80,000 pounds of its store-branded butter after it was found to be missing a crucial allergy warning.

Title: CEOs Are Ready And Willing To Enforce Return-To-Office Mandates Despite The Proven Benefits Of Working From Home

by Michael Levanduski When the global COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020 there were many devastating consequences, some of which are still coming to light today. As awful as it was, however, there were some ways in which life improved. For many people, one of the biggest benefits of the pandemic was that companies had to let employees work from home. Much to the surprise of just about everyone, it turned out that employees in most roles were able to work successfully (or even improve productivity) while working from home. While some people prefer working in the office due to the social and teamwork aspects of their jobs or personalities, the vast majority of people say that working from home is a huge improvement in their life. Because of this, people have been reluctant to return to the office after the pandemic ended, and CEOs were hesitant to try to force them out of fear of losing top talent. Well, now that the employment cycle is swinging back to a situation where it is harder to find a new job, many CEOs are looking at implementing return-to-office mandates, and the employees are furious. Global research and accounting firm KPMG released a report that found that 89% of CEOs in the US are looking at ways to bring people back to the office, including offering better opportunities, assignments, and other perks who come back voluntarily. Many people think that this is just one step toward requiring everyone to come back. Many major corporations including Amazon and Tesla have already demanded that all employees start working from the office again, with mixed results. As soon as companies announce that they are requiring people to report to an office, many of them start looking for new jobs right away. This, however, might actually be what some CEOs want. Rather than going through a round of layoffs due to the downturn in the economy, they can get people to leave voluntarily through this type of mandate. Ethics aside, this can be effective. While return-to-office mandates are already happening, and more are likely to come in the future, the battle for the ability to work from home is not over. Many people also think that companies pushing employees to return to the office will regret it in the long run. Top-tier employees who can always find work will gravitate to companies that allow a work-from-home or hybrid arrangement, giving those companies a major competitive advantage. Working from home is a huge benefit to employees.

Title: Raise a glass: A lot of top-shelf booze is more affordable this holiday season

Time Published: 2024-12-12T20:00:00Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Booze will cost you more this holiday season than last — but not much more. And there are ways to increase the bang for your buck while grabbing a round of drinks or bringing a bottle to a gathering. As is usually the case, alcohol is still generally cheaper at home than in bars and restaurants, and beer remains lower-priced than many liquors. But some spirits, including many tequilas and whiskeys, are seeing noteworthy price drops that have made even top-shelf bottles a bit more affordable. Whiskey bought for at-home consumption is nearly 2% less expensive, on average, than a year ago, federal inflation numbers released Wednesday show. Beer served out of the house, on the other hand, is about 4% pricer. And on Thursday, federal regulators turned a spotlight on retail booze prices, accusing a major U.S. liquor distributor of favoring big chains like Costco and Kroger over independent shops, making it harder for smaller operators to compete. So far, at any rate, many price moves for alcoholic beverages have been relatively modest. Booze costs rose nearly 15% from the first half of 2019 to the first half of this year, less than the 23% jump in consumer prices at large during that period. As of last month, alcohol costs were up only 1.8% since the year before, while inflation overall was 2.7%. You can really find good-quality product at a lower price. Often it’s better than the stuff you’re paying more for. Marten Lodewijks, president of IWSR U.S. Sluggish demand has helped keep prices in check. “It’s been a pretty rough year for alcohol sales,” said Marten Lodewijks, president of the U.S. division of the beverage industry data firm IWSR. “It’s been fairly consistent across the board: a general pulling back of consumer spend on alcohol, and spirits in particular.” That trend coincides with a broader caution rippling through the economy. Retail sales around Thanksgiving showed many households are still eager to spend, but only at the right price. Many brands are chasing value-wary shoppers’ wallets with increasingly competitive deals and discounts. “As a nonessential item, it hit consumers quite hard,” Lodewijks said of inflation’s impact on alcohol in recent years. “When prices on everything else started going up, suddenly that extra $5 on a bottle of spirits was meaningful.” His firm flagged in September that sales volumes had declined more than expected during the first seven months of this year for beer, wine and spirits alike; the only exception was in canned cocktails, which beverage makers have been pushing heavily. The falloffs came amid growing interest in nonalcoholic mocktails and signs that younger people are thinking twice about causal drinking. Shares of Diageo, a major importer of Scottish whiskey, and Pernod Ricard, which imports Absolut Vodka and Jameson whiskey, are each down by double digits since the start of this year. U.S. beer sales have also suffered, squeezing brewers who have faced a yearslong pullback after the previous decade’s craft beer boom. Even so, beer remains the cheapest and by far the most popular alcohol at full-service restaurants, accounting for over half of booze sales in those settings this year, according to data released Tuesday by the transaction processor Toast. Typically, weaker sales encourage price cuts, but this week’s inflation data showed beer at bars and restaurants posting the biggest jump — climbing 4% between November 2023 and last month. Lodewijks said at least two factors are likely at play: Many brewers have been passing on higher costs to their customers and chasing higher-dollar drinkers. “While mainstream and below beer has seen major volume losses, premium and above beer has generally fared very well,” he said. “Now, consumers won’t be fooled into thinking a mainstream beer is premium simply by raising prices, but this could be an attempt by some brand owners to change the perception of their brand by moving it up the price ladder.” There are still big unknowns when it comes to brewers’ costs. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in November led some beer makers to voice fresh worries about tariffs, after his first round hit the aluminum and steel-reliant industry in 2018. Even Modelo importer Constellation Brands, which had waved off trade concerns before the election, saw its stock fall 3.5% after Trump proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico last month, before shares steadied. In the meantime, some of the industry’s headwinds since its pandemic-era boom are still benefiting consumers this holiday season. The price of agave, a key ingredient in tequila and mezcal, has fallen dramatically since 2022, when it peaked at 32 Mexican pesos per kilogram, or about $1.60. By February 2024, 1 kilogram of agave cost just 5 Mexican pesos, or less than 30 cents. Tequila manufacturers took advantage as demand soared, producing trendy luxury tequilas — many of them at lower prices. That has made it easier to buy a high-quality bottle in recent years without spending more, Lodewijks said. “What consumers are saying is, ‘I’m not going to spend $50, but spending $30, I can get a really good tequila for that price,’” he said. Tequila is still the priciest liquor you can order at a sit-down restaurant, averaging $13.48 per drink as of the third quarter, the Toast data shows. But it’s the only booze whose costs have remained basically flat for the past year. Premium bourbons have propped up the U.S. whiskey industry, which is relatively strong at the moment even as Scottish and other imported options struggle, Lodewijks said. Still, whiskey was the only at-home alcoholic beverage to see prices outright decline since last year, inflation data shows. Whiskey distillers have seen softer demand in key markets like California, Florida and Kentucky, according to IWSR. But Lodewijks said it could be that producers have managed to lower their costs through more efficient production. “Shop around and do your research, and you can really find good-quality product at a lower price,” he advised holiday quaffers and bottle-gifters. “Often it’s better than the stuff you’re paying more for.” Alexandra Byrne is an intern with the NBC News Business and Economy Unit. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: How A.I. Is Actually Changing the Physical World Through ‘Digital Twins’

A digital twin sounds a lot like a long-lost sibling you found on Ancestry, but it has nothing to do with that. Rather, it’s a virtual replica of a real space, such as a warehouse or a factory, that include technology, people and processes. Digital twins have the potential to forever change how these spaces function while impacting millions of jobs in the manufacturing and logistics sectors. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Manufactured and shipped goods are the lifeblood of our society, and companies around the world are filling warehouses and factories with robots. For example, Walmart in April started rolling out autonomous forklifts in distribution centers. Just this month, the semiconductor maker Lam Research released a collaborative robot (dubbed a “cobot”) to conduct high-precision maintenance on product material. But to introduce robots without a hitch requires serious planning, and digital twins make that possible—all without having to subject workers and the space they inhabit to potentially dangerous environments. “You can simulate sensors, you can simulate robots, you can simulate people, you can simulate machines, you can train your A.I. agents, all of that in the simulated world,” Amit Goel, director of product management for autonomous machines at Nvidia (NVDA), told Observer. Digital twins are particularly useful in tasks like deploying new robots, training and certifying operators, and introducing new manufacturing technologies. “Those tests are cheaper, faster and, most importantly, safer,” Leo Moran, a senior manager at Kalyspo, an automation consulting company, told Observer. “That’s really crucial in a world where the application of robotics is accelerating at an unbelievable pace.” Kalypso offers services like supply chain optimization, autonomous manufacturing and digital twin creation. The company runs 3D models on Nvidia’s Omniverse 3D development platform and the Isaac Sim robotics simulation platform. On Omniverse, for example, Kalypso tests new features like ray tracing, which simulates how light behaves in the real world. (This feature can be used in digital twins of warehouses for a more realistic simulation experience.) “The renderings look amazing. You can look at how light moves, how objects interact. It looks much more real so you get out of that uncanny valley you often have in this space,” Moran said. More than the beauty they evoke, these digital replicas allow companies to ask questions such as “What are the safety implications of having 50 robots in a room instead of 20?” and “Will people still be able to safely move through there?”—all without subjecting workers to uncertain environments, Moran added. While digital twins are arguably one of the most influential behind-the-scene elements working to upend the industrial sector as we know it, they’re not all roses. Building digital twins can be really expensive because of the computing power they require, said Nvidia’s Goel. In November, Nvidia released a suite of generative A.I. blueprint models to help propel clients to create digital twins at scales as large as entire warehouses at the highest fidelity. Moran noted the biggest challenge isn’t necessarily the technology itself, but the people building and operating it. “It’s a very multi-disciplinary job,” he said. “You need to have an understanding of robotics, automation, computer science, controls engineering, mechanical engineering. The supply for talent does not meet the demand today.” Sometimes called mechatronics engineering by institutions like Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering and Rochester Institute of Technology, this sort of multidisciplinary education is still catching up with the technology industry’s needs.

Title: Semiconductor Stocks Exposed To China With Tariffs Incoming
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/12/12/semiconductor-stocks-exposed-to-china-with-tariffs-incoming/
Time Published: 2024-12-12T19:47:51Z

Semiconductor stocks will come into focus in 2025 as geopolitical tensions rise. China is likely to retaliate following Trump’s most recent threats of 10% additional tariffs to all Chinese goods. This escalation in tariffs and retaliation is expected to have an impact on semiconductor sales in China, particularly affecting chipmakers with higher exposure to China. Nvidia, AMD and Micron have some of the lowest exposure among the leading chipmakers, while wafer fab equipment (WFE) manufacturers and Qualcomm have some of the highest exposure. The flags of China and the USA are being displayed on a smartphone, with an NVIDIA chip visible in ... [+] the background, in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Tariffs have not yet been implemented, yet the risks to the semiconductor industry and supply chain are already becoming visible. A report from the Commercial Times highlighted that the supply chain is scrambling to secure product prior to early 2025, with segments such as “display panels, IC design, memory, and optical communications” seeing an increase in rush orders. Optical firm Lianyi highlighted that telecom customers have “increased their efforts to replenish inventory at the end of the year, adding a wave of demand.” Additionally, to mitigate impacts of potential tariffs, some Chinese firms are attempting to shift production to Thailand and Vietnam, leading to longer supply times and additional order placements to secure enough supply. This comes as the US is continuing to implement stricter export restrictions on US-made chips to China, with the Commerce Department announcing restrictions on 24 types of chipmaking equipment, as well as bans on numerous Chinese firms. As a result, wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending in China is expected to take a rather large hit next year. Wafer fab equipment (WFE) refers to the equipment used to process wafers into chips, through processes like etching, deposition, and through ultraviolet wavelengths in a process called EUV lithography. Through the first half of 2024, China’s spending on WFE totaled more than $25 billion, putting it on track to spend $50 billion this year for the first time ever. For 2025, WFE spending is projected to drop below $40 billion, in line with 2023’s levels, and tracking for a -20% to -25% YoY decline. Some of the WFE manufacturers that are heavily exposed to China include ASML at nearly 50% of systems revenue year-to-date, and Applied Materials, KLA and Lam Research at 37% to 43% of revenue. In 2024, chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader semiconductor industry, with ASML seeing China contribute nearly half of its systems revenue. Here’s how the leading WFE manufacturers stack up in terms of exposure to China. Chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader ... [+] semiconductor industry, near or above 40% of revenue. More than 48% of ASML’s systems revenue year-to-date has come from China while Lam Research and KLA both see China contributing ~42% of total revenue. Applied Materials’ China exposure in fiscal 2024 was slightly lower at 37%. This is a rather steep increase from the 26% to 29% range from fiscal 2023 for all four companies. This year-over-year surge in China revenue to elevated levels presents significant risk as export restrictions and tariffs combine as two primary headwinds. As a result of these two threats, as well as declining WFE spending and declining domestic utilization rates weighing on the equipment market’s growth, China exposure is expected is decline dramatically next year. Take ASML as an example. So far in 2024 (Q1 to Q3), China has accounted for $7.06 billion of its $14.56 billion in systems revenue. For the full year, China is expected to maintain this contribution level in the high-40% range, before dropping to 20% in 2025. This suggests China revenue could decline approximately -33% YoY to ~$7 billion. Applied Materials has just over $10 billion in revenue from China, Lam has over $6 billion, and KLA has over $4 billion, exposing the trio to hundreds of millions to billion-dollar losses in revenue streams should China revenue decline in the double-digits next year. On the other hand, some of the market’s leading AI players have the lowest China exposure, with less than 20% of revenue from China. Despite being the subject of some of the strictest export restrictions for its leading AI GPUs, Nvidia has some of the lowest exposure to China as a percentage of revenue, alongside competitor AMD and key suppliers Micron and TSMC. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia’s China (and Hong Kong) revenue rose 34.4% YoY to $5.42 billion, as it “ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license.” As a percentage of revenue, China accounted for 15.4% of revenue, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. China accounted for 15.4% of revenue for Nvidia in Q3, up from 12.2% in Q2 and 9.6% in Q1. Even with this acceleration in China revenue since Nvidia was hit with export restrictions in Q4 2023, China’s contribution remains lower than historical levels, in the low 20% region. Nvidia’s upcoming GB200 NVL36, NVL72, and B200 all face export restrictions and require licenses to ship to China, while the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S, and RTX 4090 have already been restricted. This means that moving forward, China’s growth will continue to primarily come from China-specific products rather to those that could be subject to restrictions. AMD and Micron similarly have low revenue exposure from China and restrictions in place preventing sales of certain chips to the region. Certain variants of AMD’s Instinct GPUs and Versal FPGAs are restricted from being sold to China, while China banned Micron from key infrastructure products in 2023 due to national security risks. For fiscal 2023, AMD’s China revenue was approximately 15% of revenue, down from 22% in fiscal 2022. AMD has not provided any quarterly updates on China revenue through FY24, though management said last quarter that they are “underrepresented in China market in the server CPU side,” with opportunities to gain share. Micron’s China exposure has hovered in the 16% of revenue range for FY22 through FY24, due to bans from China limiting its growth in the nation. While the low exposure to China may seem like a positive, Micron faces competitive headwinds and pressure from Chinese firms in its primary markets. Analysts questioned management about China capacity hitting the market, and if it would have any impacts on Micron’s business. Management acknowledged that there has been China capacity in the market, saying that it is “primarily limited to China-oriented, China-exported customers who are using some of that supply or attempting to use it” for lower performance categories such as DDR4, LP4 and lower end NAND. However, they noted that they are focusing on the “higher profit pools” of DRAM and NAND such as HBM, LP5, and data center SSDs, so the “portion of the business that's exposed to those kinds of trends in China are really becoming smaller as a percent of our revenue over time.” Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) is exposed to a different realm of geopolitical risk due to its concentration in Taiwan, though it has faced some pressure from the US to restrict sales to China, which are quite low. Earlier in November, TSMC halted advanced chip shipments of 7nm and below to Chinese AI and GPU customers, viewed as a temporary strategy to comply with the United States government. The US reportedly believed that a sanctioned Chinese firm placed orders with TSMC via a middleman, and is attempting to crack down on this; TechNode reports that if these loopholes are closed, TSMC will be one of the most affected. Additionally, the US is seeking to place blanket restrictions on 7nm and below shipments to China, which TSMC is hoping will only be for Chinese AI customers, and not smartphone, as that would have a more substantial impact – Apple and Qualcomm are two primary customers with large smartphone revenue streams in China. In FY23, China accounted for just under 12.5% of TSMC’s revenue, up from the 10-11% level from the prior two years. Of the major semiconductor players in the market, TSMC has the lowest exposure to China, less than Nvidia, AMD and Micron. Here’s how the four stack up against some of the other more-AI exposed chipmakers. Nvidia, AMD, and Micron are among the leading AI-exposed chipmakers with the lowest revenue ... [+] contribution, while Qualcomm and Broadcom are among the highest. Two names stand out here for its elevated exposure to China – Qualcomm and Broadcom. In FY24, Qualcomm generated nearly 46% of its revenue from China, a significant improvement from China’s contribution of 67% of its revenue just three years ago. Qualcomm is seeing strong growth emerge from China from both smartphone and auto customers, noting that in Q1, QCT handset revenue is expected to grow single digits YoY driven by “greater than 40% sequential revenue growth from Chinese OEMs.” Broadcom generated over 32% of its revenue from China in FY23, down from the 35% range it had seen in three of the prior four years — much of this exposure to China stems from Apple. What’s interesting about Broadcom’s situation is that it believes that a majority of the products shipped to China ($11.5 billion revenue in FY23) are included in devices shipped back to the US or Europe, exposing it potentially to two-way tariffs, to China and from China. As tariffs risks rise with additional tariffs likely to be placed on China, and China threatening to retaliate with a 20% price cut advantage for domestic goods. Experts say the new policy will also affect US products sold in China, potentially impacting chipmakers with substantial Chinese revenue streams if they cannot outcompete domestic alternatives. What this means is that not only will semiconductors face geopolitical risks from tariff threats and a possible trade war, but they will also face a tougher selling climate in China as the country pushes for more domestic production towards its goal for 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by the end of 2025. For Nvidia, although its share of China revenue is quite low at 15%, the country is a $20 billion plus market for them due to their rapid revenue growth, whereas for AMD, China was not even a $3.5 billion market in FY23. Though China’s 20% price advantage policy aims to promote domestic alternatives to US products, China is still hard-pressed to find a suitable alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs, with Huawei’s Ascend 910B only rivaling Nvidia’s A100 released four years ago. For companies like ASML, and its peers in WFE manufacturing, where China contributes 40% or more of revenue, the backdrop gets a bit more challenging as WFE spending in China is estimated to dry up slightly next year, with spending potentially dropping -25% YoY. These companies will in turn have to rely on growth in the Americas and leading-edge nodes to offset declining (or normalizing) China contribution. This is a scenario that brings a lot of ‘what-ifs’ to the table, as it’s impossible to predict what exactly will happen come 2025 when it comes to tariffs and when it comes to Chinese revenue streams. At the moment, the geopolitical risk is rising for semiconductors from these retaliatory threats, and it could create some better entry points for AI semis next year.

Title: Semiconductor Stocks Exposed To China With Tariffs Incoming

Semiconductor stocks will come into focus in 2025 as geopolitical tensions rise. China is likely to retaliate following Trump’s most recent threats of 10% additional tariffs to all Chinese goods. This escalation in tariffs and retaliation is expected to have an impact on semiconductor sales in China, particularly affecting chipmakers with higher exposure to China. Nvidia, AMD and Micron have some of the lowest exposure among the leading chipmakers, while wafer fab equipment (WFE) manufacturers and Qualcomm have some of the highest exposure. The flags of China and the USA are being displayed on a smartphone, with an NVIDIA chip visible in ... [+] the background, in this photo illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Tariffs have not yet been implemented, yet the risks to the semiconductor industry and supply chain are already becoming visible. A report from the Commercial Times highlighted that the supply chain is scrambling to secure product prior to early 2025, with segments such as “display panels, IC design, memory, and optical communications” seeing an increase in rush orders. Optical firm Lianyi highlighted that telecom customers have “increased their efforts to replenish inventory at the end of the year, adding a wave of demand.” Additionally, to mitigate impacts of potential tariffs, some Chinese firms are attempting to shift production to Thailand and Vietnam, leading to longer supply times and additional order placements to secure enough supply. This comes as the US is continuing to implement stricter export restrictions on US-made chips to China, with the Commerce Department announcing restrictions on 24 types of chipmaking equipment, as well as bans on numerous Chinese firms. As a result, wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending in China is expected to take a rather large hit next year. Wafer fab equipment (WFE) refers to the equipment used to process wafers into chips, through processes like etching, deposition, and through ultraviolet wavelengths in a process called EUV lithography. Through the first half of 2024, China’s spending on WFE totaled more than $25 billion, putting it on track to spend $50 billion this year for the first time ever. For 2025, WFE spending is projected to drop below $40 billion, in line with 2023’s levels, and tracking for a -20% to -25% YoY decline. Some of the WFE manufacturers that are heavily exposed to China include ASML at nearly 50% of systems revenue year-to-date, and Applied Materials, KLA and Lam Research at 37% to 43% of revenue. In 2024, chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader semiconductor industry, with ASML seeing China contribute nearly half of its systems revenue. Here’s how the leading WFE manufacturers stack up in terms of exposure to China. Chipmaking equipment manufacturers had some of the highest exposure levels to China in the broader ... [+] semiconductor industry, near or above 40% of revenue. More than 48% of ASML’s systems revenue year-to-date has come from China while Lam Research and KLA both see China contributing ~42% of total revenue. Applied Materials’ China exposure in fiscal 2024 was slightly lower at 37%. This is a rather steep increase from the 26% to 29% range from fiscal 2023 for all four companies. This year-over-year surge in China revenue to elevated levels presents significant risk as export restrictions and tariffs combine as two primary headwinds.

Spotting Ozempic and GLP-1-friendly meals in the frozen food aisle at your local grocery store just got easier. Conagra Brands (CAG-0.25%), the maker of products like Boom Chicka Pop, Hunt’s, and Marie Callender’s, announced today that it will add a “GLP-1 friendly” label to 26 select items in its Healthy Choice frozen food line. The new “On Track” badge is designed to help customers easily identify meals that are low-calorie, high-protein, and a good source of fiber — all factors that could benefit someone on weight-loss medication. “The increased use of GLP-1 medications presents an exciting opportunity to support Americans managing diabetes and weight loss, as well as those seeking to lead a healthier lifestyle,” said Bob Nolan, vice president of Demand Science at Conagra Brands, in a press release. “Our ‘On Track’ badge reflects our commitment to providing accessible, healthy meal options tailored to their needs.” GLP-1 medications are a class of drugs, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+0.72%) Ozempic, that mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies and clinical trials have been finding that these drugs also have health benefits beyond weight loss. Popular brands on the market also include Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.48%) Zepbound. Soaring demand for these treatments has made Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly the largest pharma companies in the world and has had broader effects on the economy. Execs at both Nestle and Walmart have noted that these drugs are shifting consumer preferences. A survey from Morgan Stanley (MS-1.03%) found that GLP-1 users are spending less money at restaurants. Conagra isn’t the first food company to jump on the GLP-1 bandwagon. Earlier this year, Nestle (NSRGY+1.27%) launched a frozen food brand, Vital Pursuit, catering to consumers who use GLP-1 treatments.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has shed more light on his views on popular weight-loss treatments. Kennedy told CNBC’s (CMCSA+0.12%) Jim Cramer on Thursday that while GLP-1 medications have their place in treatment, lifestyle changes should remain the primary approach for weight loss. This marks a more nuanced stance from the nominee, who has previously been critical of pharmaceutical solutions to obesity. “The first line of response should be lifestyle. It should be eating well, making sure you that you don’t get obese. Those GLP drugs have a place,” Kennedy said. GLP-1 medications are a class of drugs that mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies and clinical trials have been finding that these drugs also have health benefits beyond weight loss. Popular brands on the market also include Wegovy (NVO+0.72%) and Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.48%) Zepbound. Soaring demand for these treatments has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the largest pharma companies in the world. Kennedy has previously come out more strongly against the growing use of these drugs. Instead, he has repeatedly promoted healthy eating as a solution to the country’s obesity epidemic. “If we just gave good food, three meals a day, to every man, woman and child in our country, we could solve the obesity and diabetes epidemic overnight,” Kennedy told Fox News in October before the election. His remarks contrast those of another Trump supporter — Elon Musk. Musk, the richest person alive and the co-head of President-elect Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), doubled down on his support for expanding access to affordable GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic. “Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public. Nothing else is even close,” Musk wrote Wednesday morning in a post on X, the social media site he owns. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Costco (COST) is set to report its fiscal first quarter results as inflationary-weary shoppers turn to the wholesale retailer. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to come in at $3.81, per Bloomberg consensus estimates. Revenue is expected to come in at $62.14 billion. Same-store sales, excluding fuel, are expected to grow 6.26%, boosted by its international business, followed by the US and Canada. The company is projected to clock higher foot traffic in the quarter, up 6.87% compared to a year ago. But Wall Street expects transaction growth to decline 0.40%. Year to date, Costco stock is up more than 50%, outpacing the 27% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Here's what Wall Street expects Costco to report for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 4, 2024, compared to the previous year's fiscal first quarter results: Revenue: $62.14 billion versus $57.8 billion last year Adjusted earnings per share: $3.81 versus $3.58 Total company comparable sales growth, excluding fuel: 6.26% versus 3.9% US same-store sales growth: 6.14% versus 2.6% Canada same-store sales growth: 5.68% versus 8.2% Other international sales growth: 7.08% versus 7.1% E-commerce growth: 14.1% versus 6.3% Membership fee revenue: $1.17 billion versus $1.08 billion On Sept. 1, Costco hiked the price of its Gold Star membership by $5 to $65 and the price of its Executive membership by $10 to $130. Wall Street expects the hike to be reflected in this quarter's results. It was the first time the company hiked its membership fees since 2017, and Costco said it delayed the increase until the team felt like inflation started to dissipate and consumers' spending power returned. As of the previous quarter, the change is expected to impact around 52 million memberships, a little over half of which are Executive memberships. The fee hike is expected to grow membership income by high single digits to low double digits. Membership fee income is expected to come in at $1.17 billion, more than the $1.08 billion reported last year. The company also doubled down on scanning membership cards at the door, which CEO Ron Vachris said allowed operators to know real-time foot traffic and prompt customers to renew memberships. "Membership growth remains healthy as consumers seek value and existing members continue to trade up to the Executive membership level," Joseph Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group wrote in a note to clients. Costco operates 891 warehouses worldwide as of last quarter. Wall Street expects that to grow to 895. Its e-commerce business is also expected to have another stellar quarter, up 14.1%. Sales in the previous quarter were powered by growth in appliances, tires, toys, gift cards, and food, health, and beauty aids, among other items like gold bars. Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh called Costco a "Top Pick." "We continue to see a strong outlook for market share gains and believe Costco is well positioned to sustain robust top-line momentum," he wrote in a note to clients, adding that it continues to step up efforts around general merchandise "from a powerful gift card offering to newer premium brands." He believes a stock split could be in the future. Shares are currently hovering around $1,000 per share. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Despite mounting trade restrictions, Nvidia (NVDA-1.62%) is significantly expanding its presence in China, focusing on artificial intelligence chips for autonomous vehicles, Bloomberg reports. Both a Chinese government antitrust investigation and escalating trade tensions between Beijing and Washington complicate the semiconductor giant’s efforts. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia has boosted its China workforce by a third, going from a 3,000-employee headcount at the start of the year to its current 4,000-employee headcount. Among those hires are a team dedicated to self-driving cars. The expansion comes amid heightened Chinese regulatory scrutiny of U.S. technology firms, particularly those developing artificial intelligence systems. National security concerns have intensified as defense contractors and military suppliers increase their AI investments, adding to the economic tensions between the two nations. Last week, the Commerce Department announced new restrictions on the sale of semiconductors to China. In turn, China announced that it would be curbing exports of the raw materials used to build those semiconductors to the U.S. Additionally, Nvidia itself is in the middle of an antitrust investigation by Chinese authorities regarding a chipmaker it acquired in 2020.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: European regulatory authority adopts positive opinion for an update of the Ozempic® label to reflect risk reduction of kidney disease-related events

December 12, 2024 08:47 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 12 December 2024 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for an update of the Ozempic® (once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide) label to reflect data from the FLOW kidney outcomes trial. The FLOW trial assessed the risk reduction from Ozempic® therapy in chronic kidney disease-related events, including persistent ≥50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), onset of persistent eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy, kidney death or cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the FLOW trial, semaglutide 1.0 mg demonstrated a statistically significant and superior 24% risk reduction in kidney disease progression as well as cardiovascular and kidney death compared to placebo. In addition, the secondary endpoints in the trial showed that the risk of major cardiovascular events was reduced by 18%, and the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced by 20%. “Approximately 40% of people with type 2 diabetes develop chronic kidney disease, and there is a need for treatments that can help to reduce kidney disease progression," said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for Development at Novo Nordisk. “With this positive opinion, Ozempic® will become the first and only GLP-1 receptor agonist to show lowering of risk of kidney disease progression in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease." Novo Nordisk has also filed for a label expansion in the US, and a decision is expected in the first half of 2025. About FLOWFLOW was a randomised, double-blinded, parallel-grouped, placebo-controlled, superiority trial comparing injectable semaglutide 1.0 mg with placebo as an adjunct to standard of care. The trial assessed the effect of the treatments on kidney outcomes for prevention of progression of kidney disease and risk of kidney and cardiovascular mortality in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD (defined as eGFR ≥50 and ≤75 mL/min/1.73 m2 with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] >300 and <5,000 mg/g or eGFR ≥25 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 with UACR >100 and <5,000 mg/g). A total of 3,533 people were enrolled in the trial, which was conducted in 28 countries at around 400 investigator sites. The FLOW trial was initiated in 2019. The key objective of the FLOW trial was to demonstrate delay in progression of CKD and to lower the risk of kidney and cardiovascular mortality through a composite primary endpoint consisting of the following five components: onset of persistent ≥50% reduction in eGFR according to the CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration (EPI) equation compared with baseline; onset of persistent eGFR (CKD-EPI) <15 mL/min/1.73 m2; initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation); death from kidney disease; or death from cardiovascular disease. Confirmatory secondary endpoints included annual rate of change in eGFR (CKD-EPI), major adverse cardiovascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death) and all-cause death. The FLOW data were presented at the European Renal Association Congress (ERA) in May 2024 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). About Ozempic® Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide is approved in 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg doses under the brand name Ozempic® and indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In a historic turn, Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) has once again taken the top spot, with a whopping 90% of the global GPU market share in Q3 2024. This dominance, says Jon Peddie Research (JPR) mascot, is a difficult environment for AMD and Intel competitors. Five years ago, AMD was a minor player in the space, and its share shrunk to just 10%, while Intel has scarcely budged. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Though GPU shipments overall have fallen by 7.9% year over year and 14.5% quarter over quarter, NVIDIA has laid down markers as the leading force in the GPU sector. The fall in graphics has been caused by consumer anticipation for next gen GPUs, namely NVIDIA's RTX 50 series, AMD's RX 8000 series, which have been tipped to rekindle the market. The main problem currently for AMD is that it has been losing ground since the acquisition of the ATI in 2006. The company could have to pivot swiftly if it goes any further down this track, analysts warn, as NVIDIA's innovations and manufacturing capabilities are jockeying ahead of its competitors. And it's a critical moment for AMD (AMD, Financial) and Intel (INTC, Financial) to try to redefine strategy in the GPU market, because the market's near monopoly raises questions about innovation and pricing.

Title: Meet Ritchie Ordonez, The Exec Masterminding Prime Video’s Next Steps In Europe
URL: http://deadline.com/2024/12/prime-video-europe-ritchie-ordonez-interview-1236196241/
Time Published: 2024-12-12T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Jesse Whittock International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: You might not have heard of Ritchie Ordonez, but she’s quietly become among the most important players in European streaming. Earlier this year, as Amazon was making cuts across its entertainment businesses during a major round of international restructuring, Ordonez was named head of Prime Video EU Emerging — a cluster of countries Amazon had identified as the new growth drivers in Europe that would sit opposite a group of countries on the continent where Prime Video is a household name. Internally, staff were told that investment was coming to Benelux, the CEE and the Nordics, with Africa and the Middle East the unfortunate hubs that would lose out as a result. In her first interview since the move, Ordonez doesn’t comment on how the changes played out but instead outlines her vision for the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, Turkey and Poland — though she is essentially general manager of all European territories outside of the UK, Germany, Italy, France and Spain. Related Stories News U.S. Labor Strikes, Economy & Incentive "Uncertainty" Led To 29% Decline In Drama Spend, Says Screen Australia News 'Red One' Pulls In Record 50M Global Viewers In Debut Prime Video Weekend, The Most Ever For An Amazon MGM Studio Movie Within Amazon, her unit is now being referred to as EU Expansion (EUX), perhaps a clearer indicator of the direction of travel. However, Ordonez has, in fact, effectively been working on the initiative since June 2020, when she relocated from the U.S. to Munich, Germany, to oversee marketing in the EU Expansion countries. She was upped to a general manager post two years later and took control of Benelux, the CEE and Turkey — and has since focused on investing in countries where Prime Video has acted as a trigger for Prime retail subscriptions. Watch on Deadline Moving money from the MENA region and Africa — “rebalancing” resources as Prime Video’s VP & GM for EMEA, Barry Furlong, awkwardly put it to staff at the time — left local producers in those regions disappointed to lose a key buyer just as it was getting started. Indeed, Amazon had struck deals in Africa with the likes of Inkblot Studios and Jáde Osiberu and launched its first original, Gangs of Lagos, in 2023 as part of what had been described to Deadline as “continued, long-term investment in sub-Saharan Africa.” Once the dust had settled, Prime Video began using the transferred cash to increase local acquisitions and originals in the EUX territories. Accordingly, Ordonez fronted a ‘Prime Video Presents…’ showcase in Poland just last week. So why haven’t we heard more from her? The answer is simply because she’s been in the background, squirrelling away on strategy and overseeing developments in areas such as UX, dubbing and acquisitions. “We have been in a pure building stage over the last two years,” Ordonez tells Deadline. “The change for me this year is taking on the Nordics and the bifurcation of the European business. We found a lot consistency in some of the playbooks across territories and have experimented on how we could scale that to meet our content needs, but in a sustainable way.” Amazon’s European ride Prime Video has been in Europe, in one form or another, since it acquired UK DVD rentals and streaming service Lovefilm in 2011. A global launch followed almost exactly eight years ago on December 14, 2016, and the SVoD became a key player in the streaming arms race that followed. Earlier this year, Amazon’s move to downsize its entertainment business and cut costs saw Europe split in two, with Ordonez leading emerging territories and Brigitte Ricou-Bellan taking on the established UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and France, known as EU5. Though the expansion cluster received new investment, we revealed Amazon was axing just under 5% of its Prime Video Europe staff in the restructing. Amazon hasn’t directly commented on the specifics of the layoffs. Ordonez says she and the UK-based Ricou-Bellan are “attached at the hip” as they work through the next stages of Prime Video’s European adventure. Neither come from content backgrounds — Ordonez came up through marketing and Bellan-Ricou through a boardroom-focused career. “We work very closely together — I spend more time with her than I do my husband,” jokes Ordonez. However, she acknowledges that the “much more mature” EU5 is on a “very different journey” with more robust content investments. “We realized we needed a very different playbook.” The necessity to write the rules of a new “playbook” is obvious. Streaming in Europe has changed significantly over recent years, as studios refocus on profitability over subs growth. Paramount+ and HBO Max (now Max) both rowed back from local commissioning pushes, and while Netflix, Amazon and Disney continued with originals, the order book is more scrutinized than ever. Last week, HBO boss Casey Bloys told journalists in London that Max is back in the market for European originals, but it isn’t yet clear exactly how that will play out. For Prime Video’s EUX business, which Ordonez notes is providing “all meaningful growth in Europe,” the challenge is clear. “There is a game to win in these countries,” she says. “Our goal is to grow sustainably with a path to profitability. These are meaningful countries, but they’re smaller than EU5, so it’s about looking at bespoke content needs. It’s about giving the customers the same robust content slate, but with more efficient ways of building that.” In Poland, the most nascent of Prime Video EUX’s key territories, last week signalled a big moment, with a content showcase featuring docs about singer Doda and Polish soccer star Wojciech Szczęsny, new unscripted shows Rap Generation and The 50 and further details on Season 3 of comedy reality show LOL: Last One Laughing. “People forget that we are there because we’ve been working in the background, so this is something of our debut, and our chance to highlight the content we are making,” says Ordonez. “I hope people walked away understanding that. “It’s only really the last two years we’ve been doing originals in Poland. It’s the newest for us from an investment perspective, along with Turkey, and there’s still lots to learn. We’re really early in our journey, but it’s exciting and it’s what I love about Amazon: I never would have thought I’d live in Europe or have this kind of role.” The advantage for Prime Video EUX is it has been “able to learn what is working in other territories,” says Ordonez. For example, Japanese format LOL: Last One Laughing (aka Documental) has been remade across the Prime Video footprint, including in the Nordics where there are versions in Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and the Netherlands. “We know comedy is a great way to tap into the local audience and it complements what we have on the scripted side of our global slate,” she adds. Notable shows from the Netherlands include Jorik, a doc that tells the story of notorious Dutch rapper and actor Jorik Scholten (aka Lil’ Kleine), and comedy series De Tatta’s, about a rich family who find themselves broke. From Turkey are the likes of Blue Cave (Mavi Magara), about a Navy soldier who makes a trip to honor his late wife, while the Nordic region has spawned the likes of sport sod Ingebritsen – Born to Run, crime drama STHLM Blackout and Q1 2025 will see the launch of mystery drama series Blindspar (Blind Spot) and The Commoner. Program licensing and pay-one film acquisitions have also been a key in the Nordics, Netherlands, Poland and Turkey with the audience in the latter particularly keen on local scripted movies. In the Nordics, the acquisition of nine Viaplay originals — comprising Bullshit, The Commoner, The Fortress, In the Name of Love, Jana – Marked for Life, Paradis City, Solo/Dancing Alone, Furia Season Two and Those Who Kill Season Four — was “a great way to add scripted to the slate and build a robust offer there,” says Ordonez. This came after Viaplay pulled out of the production game. The plan for originals in each country Ordonez looks after is around six to eight per year, though that could be lower in Turkey, where inflation has meant it is “challenging trying to calibrate investments,” she says. “Having around that number again helps us to complement that global slate with some local flavor, and that’s fairly consistent in most territories.” Testing models Anyone who’s been to a TV industry event or has been reading Deadline’s international coverage in the past year will know co-productions are becoming increasingly the norm at global streamers, as they seek to find ways to adapt their slates while not breaking the bank. For Prime Video EUX, this is an option that’s being explored. “The reality is we’re open,” says Ordonez. “We know we have to work leaner in those countries, so we’re pretty flexible on the models. We have co-produced in the Nordics and partnered with broadcasters in the Netherlands.” Beyond that, EUX will follow the model Prime Video has established elsewhere, for example, looking to aggregate other services (Max is offered in the Netherlands and SkyShowtime in Poland) or add more networks to Prime Video Channels. Movies and series offered via rental are also offered to make Prime Video “a first-stop entertainment destination,” as Ordonez calls it. Meanwhile, Fallout has been hit in most EUX territories thanks to the strong gaming cultures in the countries. “That makes us very excited about more of those gaming franchises like Tomb Raider and God of War coming to the service,” says Ordonez. Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, Reacher, Anne Hathaway romcom The Idea of You and The Summer I Turned Pretty have all proven popular, along with German hit Maxton Hall: The World Between Us, which has been killing it on the platform and highlights a growing desire for European content, according to Ordonez. To that end, Prime Video recently launched Spanish zombie horror Apocalypse Z: The Beginning of the End (aka Apocalipsis Z: El Principio Del Fin), and it performed strong in the EUX countries. In Turkey, Korean series Marry My Husband, which was co-produced with local streamer TVING, landed well. “These programs are really starting to travel,” says Ordonez. On the movie front, she notes, “A lot cinemas haven’t bounced back in the way they would have liked post-Covid, and supporting that sector is important.” This means working with local exhibitors, distributors and producers, and being flexible enough to give films theatrical windows when needed. “During Covid, we had a lot of films that we had to launch direct-to-streaming just by virtue of there being no cinemas open, and we’ve seen the outcome on both of those methods,” says Ordonez. “We don’t see any cannibalization, frankly, when we have theatrical launches. In fact, a lot of those titles bring in new customers, even if they have a TVoD window on Prime Video. It’s so fragmented and people have so little time, but there is still a massive audience to tap into, and so we’re open to any of those models. Producers are excited about having that theatrical presence and that works, but other titles have gone direct-to-streaming and that’s been successful, too.” Looking ahead, Andrew Bennett is set to replace Barry Furlong at the head of Amazon Europe’s Prime Video teams. Prime Video VP of International Kelly Day said recently the long-serving Bennett, who is relocating from the U.S., would bring acumen in “content acquisition, partnerships and business development, marketing, and product/tech” to the role. Ordonez isn’t commenting ahead of the change, but it’s understood Prime Video Europe is taking a ‘business as usual’ approach before Bennett’s vision for the business takes shape. What she will say of 2025 is that she expects her key challenge to be “keeping up with the volume, and trying to figure out the models.” There could be more opportunistic deals such as the Viaplay agreement to add scripted to the slate, to offset “risky and expensive” original production, while on the unscripted front she points to how local versions of LOL have led to contestants landing Prime Video specials and building out their personalities. “That has really captured the local culture,” she adds. “If in 12 months’ time we can say the growth has continued and we’ve added to the slate with local originals, that would be a success, along with growing the channels and TVOD,” concludes Ordonez. “Getting the content right is the most challenging thing — you don’t have a lot of shots at that. We have to be thoughtful about it and we’re learning from all of the things we’ve launched.” Ordonez and co will soon get the chance to apply that knowledge to the next stage of EUX’s lifecycle.

Title: Assetera Enables Non-U.S. Investors to Trade Tokenized Nvidia, Coinbase, and S&P 500

Assetera, a Polygon-powered MiFID-licensed trading venue for blockchain-based securities in Europe, has listed Backed Finance's tokenized assets, offering non-U.S. investors to gain exposure to trackers linked to some of the most sought-after U.S. companies. The initial launch includes tokenized trackers tied to the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN), one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, the chip-maker Nvidia (NVDA), a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence (AI) and risk assets, and the blue-chip index, the S&P 500 (SPX), the company said in the press release shared with CoinDesk on Thursday. The platform plans to list tokenized Treasury bills, or short-term U.S. government securities with maturities of one year or less, designed for liquidity-focused investors. Futures plans include a potential listing of money market funds, bonds, stablecoins and private-credit tokens. When trading these tokenized trackers, Assetera's users will receive Backed's bTokens, representing shares in the underlying assets. These bTokens are fully collateralized and issued under an approved European Union prospectus, ensuring transparent and secure 24/7 trading. These tokens offer significant flexibility, as they can be stored in any wallet and moved beyond traditional market hours and across chains, with the help of Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol. "This collaboration reflects our commitment to innovation in financial markets and the empowerment of investors globally," Thomas Labenbacher, CEO of Assetera, said, as Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed Finance, said it allows investors to get exposure to traditional financial assets via an onchain and regulated environment. Asset tokenization is the process of using blockchain technology to convert a traditional asset's value into a digital token, facilitating 24/7 availability, access for all, composability and instant global collateral mobility. A 2022 projection by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) put the value of the tokenized asset market at an astounding $16 trillion in 2030 versus less than $100 billion today. Regulatory uncertainty and security concerns have long hindered the widespread adoption of digital assets, but Assetera is tackling these challenges using rigorous adults to mitigate vulnerabilities. The company told CoinDesk that it uses AI-powered real-time monitoring systems to detect and address suspicious activity, adding that Backend's robust and scalable infrastructure and expertise in democratizing finance through tokenization solidified the partnership.

Title: Watch These GE Vernova Price Levels as Stock Jumps After Investor Update
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-ge-vernova-price-levels-as-stock-jumps-after-investor-update-8759465
Time Published: 2024-12-12T00:12:51Z
Full Content:
GE Vernova (GEV) shares jumped on Wednesday, one day after the energy equipment maker raised its long-term sales outlook. The company, which projected 2028 sales of about $45 billion, also announced a 25-cent quarterly dividend and $6 billion stock buyback. Since the company’s spinoff from GE Aerospace (GE) on April 2 as part of three-way breakup of the General Electric conglomerate, GE Vernona shares have more than doubled, boosted by surging demand for gas turbines and electrical grid equipment used to generate power for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The stock gained 5% to close Wednesday near $344. Below, we take a closer look at GE Vernova’s chart and apply technical analysis to locate important price levels worth watching after the company’s financial update. After topping out in November, GE Vernova shares consolidated within an ascending triangle before breaking down below the pattern’s lower trendline in Tuesday’s trading session. However, the shares staged an impressive intraday reversal today to close back within the triangle on the highest trading volume since early June, potentially creating a bear trap in the process. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) turned upwards after several consecutive lower readings, signaling improving price momentum. Let’s identify important overhead areas on GE Vernova's chart to watch and also point out two key support levels to monitor during retracements. Amid further buying, investors should watch how the stock's price responds to the $355 area, a region on the chart where it may encounter selling pressure near the ascending triangle's top trendline. To project a price target above the stock's record high, investors can use the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes prior price action to forecast future moves. To apply the tool to GE Vernova’s chart, we calculate the distance between the ascending triangle’s two trendlines near their widest point and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. In this case, we add $45 to $355, which projects a bullish target of $400, an area where those who bought the stock at lower levels could decide to lock in profits. The first lower level to watch sits around $295. This area, currently situated just below the 50-day moving average, could provide support near the low of a bullish engulfing pattern and other nearby trading activity that formed on the chart towards the top of the stock’s trending move between August and November Finally, selling below this area could see a decline to the $258 level, a region on the chart where the shares could attract buying interest near a cluster on candlesticks positioned around the September peak.
