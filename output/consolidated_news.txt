Sources familiar with the plan also told Bloomberg that the funding would include federal-private partnerships and possible Department of Energy-led permitting reforms. While exact allocations remain undisclosed as of the time of writing, the package is expected to prioritize regions facing power congestion due to rising AI workloads, including Pennsylvania, Texas, and Georgia. According to Axios, over 60 energy and technology CEOs will attend the summit, including representatives from ExxonMobil, Amazon Web Services, Chevron, Palantir, and BlackRock. The initiative comes against a backdrop of mounting strain on U.S. electricity infrastructure, with data centers now among the fastest-growing sources of demand. A Reuters analysis published last week found that demand from AI-driven compute loads is outpacing available generation in key markets. Meta, for example, recently secured 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois under a 20-year agreement. Analysts say Trump’s proposal could redirect investment back toward fossil generation and nuclear while reducing federal support for wind and solar. Bloomberg noted the plan may scale back Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, potentially cutting over 300 gigawatts of future renewable capacity. Critics argue the energy shift could benefit legacy infrastructure at the expense of decarbonization targets. Trump’s announcement also includes a plan to redevelop a former Aliquippa steel mill into a high-density data center complex, according to CBS News. The site would anchor one of several new AI-energy corridors envisioned under the program.

The official menopause wiki for Lemmy's c/menopause community, and its Reddit siblings, r/menopause and r/perimenopause. The following information is intended for educational purposes only, to provide a basis on which to further explore with your doctors. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Find a menopause practitioner at the following menopause societies or check our Menopause Provider Directory for more Menopause is not a disease, it is a natural biological process, experienced by half the population. Medical intervention is not always necessary, but it’s important to educate ourselves on what to expect so that we can make informed decisions throughout the transition. Due to the recent ’re-awakening’ of menopause in social media, there are many conflicting and confusing views on menopause and how to manage symptoms. This Menopause Wiki provides a balanced introduction so that you can arm yourself with knowledge, and feel empowered to take charge of your own journey. Doctors recommend checking with your mother as an indicator of what to expect, but this may not be an accurate gauge; your experience might be more in line with sisters instead. Similarities shared during upbringing and exposure to the same lifestyle/environment are better predictors of how you might experience symptoms, but the age at which your mother reached menopause may be more similar to yours. Either way, asking the women in your family could help to plan ahead. Some women breeze through the menopause transition with few or no symptoms, while others experience debilitating symptoms for a decade or longer; most fall somewhere in-between. Therapies that work for some women may not work at all for you. The transition is often described as “reverse puberty” and this seems most apt. Our mothers/aunts/grandmas rarely discussed their menopause, likely because older generations felt it was largely taboo to discuss ‘delicate’ women’s issues. Others simply didn’t associate many of the common symptoms to hormonal changes, or their brain fog made them forget entirely! This knowledge gap has lead to a new generation of women who know little-to-nothing about this major life change. Almost everyone relates menopause to two things: (1) hot flashes and (2) periods ending, freedom from all the mess and pregnancy worry, when in fact one of the most common symptoms of menopause (and rarely heard of) is “atrophic vaginitis”, the thinning, drying and shrinking of the vagina…horrifying right?! For many coming into perimenopause (the time before menopause), we first notice subtle changes in our cycles, in our bodies and moods, but have no idea what is going on; we aren’t ready! This is why it is so important we talk about menopause, not only for those of us experiencing it, but also for the next generation of women who are worried and confused about what’s happening to their bodies and are too afraid to seek help. Collectively we can move beyond the realizations that we’re not crazy, or worse, dying, and seek help without barriers. Most medical professionals are woefully inadequate in recognizing menopause, and even less equipped in offering advice or treatment options. In fact, only a small fraction of doctors receive any formal training in menopause medicine, and even then it’s only a brief chapter in medical school; some gynecologists even struggle to identify menopause. Due to this lack of training and knowledge, less than 15% of women receive effective treatment for their symptoms. Doctors are quick to prescribe antidepressants and pain medication for what sounds like depression/anxiety and ’normal aging’ aches and pains, but rarely make the connection to hormones. Doctors can be very dismissive when presented with symptoms so it is important to know what you want and be persistent. Despite the extra effort (and learning curve), it is up to us to arm ourselves with knowledge â read research, form a network (talk to your friends and relatives), and know that when you enter perimenopause, you are not crazy and you are certainly not alone! Perimenopause occurs between the ages of 40-50 (can be earlier) and is the time leading up to menopause. The average length of this stage is anywhere between 4 and 10 years (longer for some). Hormones (estrogen, progesterone and testosterone) wildly fluctuate and physical changes occur, including the length of time between periods. The perimenopause transition occurs over a number of years in two phases (1) the early phase and (2) the late phase. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. As well as irregular periods, this is also a time when women might feel ‘off’ or experience subtle changes like general aches, pains, and mood fluctuations. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. Since everyone is different, there is no definitive timeline of when symptoms occur, or when periods stop. In fact, perimenopause is often discovered in hindsight and over time. Pregnancy is still possible during perimenopause. As hormones continue to decrease women can experience one or more of the symptoms listed below. Perimenopause ends one year after the final menstrual period. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker events” and soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. Is this perimenopause? can help you narrow it down. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when one full year (12 months) has passed without a period (not using hormonal contraception). According to meta-analyses of global data (2024), the mean age of reaching menopause (aka post-menopause) is 48.8 years (Europe is 51), but typically it can be between the ages of 45 and 55. Map outlining the age of menopause by country for 2025. Early (non-surgical) menopause, before the age of 45, is often influenced by other factors, such as social class, mother’s smoking, and those who smoked in childhood and early adulthood and early menopause carries other risk factors. In menopause, ovaries have stopped producing estrogen, or only produce a very small amount. Around this time testosterone slows, resulting in decreased sex drive. Menopause is diagnosed retrospectively, when a woman has had no periods for one year or more, typically it is acknowledged on the one day…the day after 12 months without a period. Once menopausal, there is no magic “yay” moment where all other symptoms stop too and life goes back to normal. In fact, many women continue to experience all the same symptoms as before (just without periods), and these symptoms can carry on for years or even decades beyond that last period. Even if symptoms resolve around this time, we still may feel different physically and mentally. Note: If spotting occurs when nearing that 12 month mark, the clock resets back to one month and the count starts all over again - which does happen and is very frustrating. Also if any bleeding occurs after 12 months of not having a period, you must see your doctor to have tests done. Any bleeding beyond the 12 months is not normal and should be investigated. Occurs at any age when a woman’s ovaries are removed or badly damaged due to a medical treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation. When hormone-producing ovaries are removed, women are thrown into immediate menopause, which is a shock to the body and can be very debilitating and may have permanent, significant repercussions on health if not treated. This is especially true if ovary removal occurs before the age of 45 (which is classified as early menopause) as it carries higher risks for osteoporosis, heart disease, and dementia. When a woman has a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and/or cervix), she sometimes has her ovaries removed as well, and sometimes not. In cases where one or both ovaries are retained, the woman will most likely continue to have ovarian function and not be menopausal, though in some cases, the shock of the surgery might hasten menopausal changes. In women who have had a hysterectomy, they cannot rely on vaginal bleeding patterns to assess menopausal status, so testing FSH levels may be helpful. There is no definitive blood test to diagnose menopause, but repeated hormonal tests over a period of time may provide some insight. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when more than one year has passed without a period. This is also the same day as reaching ‘menopause’ (above). Despite no longer having periods, we can continue to experience varying degrees of symptoms beyond that last period. Even in post-menopause, our ovaries still produce very small amounts of estrogen but not enough for pregnancy to occur. While hormonal swings settle down and some symptoms may improve, post-menopausal women are now faced with increased risk for diseases, particularly heart disease, osteoporosis (bone loss) and dementia to name a few. The average age of becoming menopausal (aka post-menopausal) is 48-51 years old, and because of increased life expectancy, women can expect to spend approximately 30-50% of their lives in a post-menopausal state. It is estimated that this year (2025) more than one billion women globally will be in perimenopause or post-menopause. Note: any post-menopausal bleeding/spotting is not normal and should be evaluated by your doctor. Oftentimes it can be just one last spike in hormones, or due to vaginal atrophy/tearing. Doctors should suggest a pap, pelvic ultrasound, and perhaps uterine biopsy to rule out other potential issues. Peri/menopause is diagnosed by SYMPTOMS, or rather the process of eliminating those symptoms as being due to something else. (It is not diagnosed through follicle-stimulating hormone blood or saliva testing). The following symptoms are directly attributed to fluctuating and declining hormones, particularly estrogen. Symptoms come and go at any time between perimenopause and well into post-menopause, affecting women for years long after periods have stopped. Symptoms may improve and disappear entirely, while new ones crop up and/or become worse. Unfortunately there is no limit of how long symptoms will last, it is different for everyone. For some, symptoms continue for decades, for others they simply stop, and for many others, symptoms can be mild, temporary, and very manageable without any intervention. Menopause symptoms can mimic other ailments/diseases, and this is why it’s very important to track symptoms using an app (like a period tracker) to see trends and cyclical activities over a period of time. This information can then be shared with doctors to help rule out anything else that might be going on. Due to hormonal swings, existing conditions can also be further aggravated/worsened, such as increased IBS/GERD flare-ups, increased susceptibility to osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, (inflammatory diseases) increased skin irritations, and generally the overall weakening of our immune systems, opening the door to other medical issues. The Impact of Estrogens and Their Receptors on Immunity and Inflammation during Infection The first step with any new or unusual symptom is to visit a doctor. Check our Menopause Provider Directory which contains searchable links to find a menopause practitioner near you. There are a wide array of options to both alleviate symptoms and to also provide long-term health benefits as we age. Symptoms include, but are not limited to: It is important to note that symptoms could also be associated to normal aging, and/or previous/existing or new medical conditions, and/or other medications/herbals remedies, and/or nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, before assuming your symptoms are hormone-related, it is crucial to rule out any new and peristent symptom as being due to something else. Note: While hormone therapy can help with many symptoms listed above (particularly hot flashes/night sweats, vaginal atrophy, irritability, low sex drive, etc), it is not meant to eliminate all things-all the time. Menopause hormone therapy (MHT) can help to improve quality of life overall, but we also need to take charge of our health by incorporating several methods, such as making lifestyle changes (be the healthiest you can be) and using other medications or interventions. Atrophic vaginitis (vaginal atrophy) is the drying and thinning of vulva and vagina due to declining estrogen, and is one of the most common symptoms of perimenopause/menopause, experienced by approximately 60-70% of post-menopausal women. Yet we only expect hot flashes, not the burning, shrinking, drying of our vaginal tissues. The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is one of the most alarming and discouraging events to experience during peri/menopause, greatly affecting our self-esteem and quality of life. According to The Women’s EMPOWER Survey, of the 1,858 women, 81% were not aware of this condition, and 72% never discussed their symptoms with a health care professional because they thought it was just “normal aging” and “something to live with”. Even more shocking, those that disclosed their symptoms to doctors found that the clinician did not initiate the discussion, and most clinicians only offered lube (gels/creams) as treatment, and not vaginal estrogen. A separate, but similar issue is clitoral atrophy (urogenital atrophy) is when the clitoris loses sensitivity and shrinks/disappears. Both GSM and clitoral atrophy are commonly due to the reduction in estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. The good news is that both are highly treatable and reversible. The sooner treatment is started, the better the long-term outcome. Other concerns involve urology issues. Specifically the urethra tissue is coated in androgen receptors and when these receptors stop receiving sex hormones (from estrogen), they begin to collapse on themselves, preventing normal emptying of the urethra, therefore increasing risk for bacterial infections (yeast, UTIs). As well a changes to the vagina area, sexual and/or urinary issues, there are other common urologic conditions which make diagnosis difficult, and research is seriously lacking (big surprise!). However, the American Urological Association recently released their 2025 Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) Guidelines, which provides information to clinicians to help diagnose, counsel and treat patients. Specifically they advise that “clinicians should offer the option of a low-dose vaginal estrogen to patients with GSM to improve vulvovaginal discomfort/irritation, dryness, and/or dyspareunia”. (print this document and bring it with you to your medical appointments) It is important for everyone entering perimenopause (typically 40+, or earlier) to consider using localized vaginal estrogen as part of their regular routines to ensure vaginal/urinary health. Without ongoing and consistent treatment, GSM (atrophy) will not resolve on its own and can present more serious issues later on. This is not just about the ability to have comfortable intercourse, but also about our vulvovaginal/urinary health, self-esteem and ultimately, quality of life. Symptoms of vaginal atrophy: Symptoms of clitoral atrophy: These issues can have a significant impact on sexual function (reduced libido, orgasm). However, the good news is that these issues can be treated, reversed and prevented with vaginal estrogen or with other approved treatments. It is important to note that interstitial cystitis (IC) shares some symptoms of vaginal atrophy (along with other conditions) which makes it extremely difficult to diagnose. IC is a chronic bladder condition involving pelvic pain and urinary changes. Estrogen loss affects bladder, urethra, and vulva tissues, making them more fragile and susceptible to irritation and infection which may contribute to interstitial cystitis. Starting treatment earlier for vaginal atrophy (GSM), may help prevent risk of IC. According to the American Urological Association, their 2025 Guidelines indicate that: Estrogen binds to receptors in the vagina, vulva, urethra, bladder, and pelvic floor, shifts the vaginal cytology toward superficial cells, away from parabasal cells, and reduces the vaginal pH. Vaginal moisturizers increase the fluid content in the endothelium and reduce the vaginal pH. Personal lubricants can be water, silicone, or oil-based and are primarily used to provide short-term lubrication during sexual activity; lubricants are often used as a placebo or control treatment in clinical trials. Newer hormonal approaches include vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vaginal oxytocin, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and testosterone. DHEA is a precursor to both androgens and estrogens that is transformed into estradiol and testosterone within vaginal cells. Oxytocin is a pituitary hormone primarily implicated in uterine labor contractions and lactation, but vaginal oxytocin gel has also been shown to reduce vaginal pH and increase the proportion of superficial cells in small studies. These treatments are outlined in more detail below. Vaginal low-dose localized estrogen is the “gold standard” treatment for GSM/vaginal atrophy, it is well-tolerated by most and quite safe for many, no matter what age. Localized estrogen comes in vaginal tablets (such as Vagifem, Imvexxy, etc), vaginal cream (such as Estrace, Premarin, etc), or vaginal ring (Estring) are prescription medications that are inserted or applied directly into the vagina. Generally the tablets and cream are used every day for two weeks, and then twice weekly after that for the reversal and prevention of atrophy. The vaginal ring stays in your vagina for three months and then is removed/replaced every 3 months. There are no known increased risks in using these methods as they are low dose estrogen localized to the vagina only. (Because the estrogen is such a low dose, it is not necessary to take progesterone.) A retrospective review of 5600 women, found that vaginal estrogen decreased urinary track infection by more than 50%. Localized estriol is a weak estrogen and the one that supports pregnancy, however it binds well to vaginal tissues, so it is shown to be effective (like estradiol) when using for GSM. (Estriol is not used in FDA-approved systemic hormone therapy.) Localized vaginal estrogen is very safe and should be prescribed for anyone over the age of 40 (or even earlier) as a preventative treatment to ensure urinary/bladder and vaginal health as we age. Some prefer vaginal tablets which can be inserted high into the vaginal canal, and dissolve slowly over time, while others prefer vaginal creams, which can be applied in the vaginal opening, over the clitoris, urethra, inner labia, etc. Creams tend to be messier for this reason and can more easily transfer to clothing/underwear. However, both methods (tablets or creams) are effective and it comes down to personal preference. Vaginal estrogen and breast cancer. The 2025 American Urological Association guideline statements #19-#21 indicates that “while there are no data stratifying the risk for breast cancer in users of local low-dose vaginal estrogen who have an above average or high risk for breast cancer, data suggest that local low-dose vaginal estrogen does not increase the risk for recurrence or of breast cancer mortality in women with a personal history of breast cancer.” Also, those “with a personal history of breast cancer are at high risk for developing GSM, sexual dysfunction, and issues with vaginal health. Endocrine therapies, including tamoxifen and AI, are an important component of the treatment on estrogen-dependent breast cancers, which make up 80% of all breast cancers. Because these therapies lower estrogen levels, the symptoms of GSM in breast cancer patients are more magnified.” An analysis of data on 49,237 women with breast cancer from two national registries in Scotland and Wales showed no increase in cancer-specific mortality was seen among women in the cohort who used vaginal estrogen. In a 2024 systematic review and metanalysis, which included eight observational studies of breast cancer survivors with GSM, there was no increased risk for breast cancer recurrence (OR: 0.48; n=24,060) in users of vaginal estrogen, nor was there an increase in breast cancer mortality (OR: 0.60; n=61695), or overall mortality. According to the Breast Cancer Org, vaginal estrogen is safe for women with breast cancer, indicating that research found vaginal estrogen didn’t increase the risk of dying from breast cancer. Studies show that localized estrogen therapy eliminates the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in 80%â90% of cases, while systemic MHT does so in 75% of cases. However, because low dose vaginal estrogen is applied directly to affected tissues, many use both localized and systemic estrogen at the same time for an added boost. The table below outlines FDA-approved treatments and dosages for GSM from the American Urological Association’s Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause - Guideline Statement 8 (Hormonal interventions): Tips for applying vaginal estrogen cream: (provided by pelvic floor therapist, u/FritaBurgerhead) The inserts/medication guides found within vaginal estrogen packaging contain long,detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers associated to estrogen. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study, when estrogen was identified as increasing risks, this warning had to be applied to ALL estrogens in any form. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off using vaginal estrogen. The estrogen warnings, according to Dr. Jen Gunter: This (estrogen warning) does not apply in ANY way to vaginal estrogen. There are no studies that have actually linked any health concerns with vaginal estrogen. Everybody can use it and there’s really just one exception…is if you’ve got a cancer, or have had a cancer that is estrogen receptor dependent, or estrogen dependent, and in that situation, talk to your doctor first.

According to a study of 178 post-menopausal women, 52% experienced female pattern hair loss (FPHL). More recent statistics indicate that by age 60, an estimated 80% of women experience hair loss. Hair loss occurs due to hormone fluctuations, particularly from the loss of estrogen and progesterone. In menopause (and also due to aging) hair becomes thinner resulting is the hair follicle shrinking, causing it to fall out. However, there are also many other factors associated to hair loss, such as genetics, low iron levels, thyroid issues, other nutrient deficiencies, stress, medications, autoimmune issues, and even some birth control. There is not a lot of research on how estrogen affects hair, but one study found that estrogen receptors are present in hair follicles, indicating that perhaps declining estrogen affects hair loss. Hair loss is not associated to colouring your hair or shampooing it too much, but certain hair styles that pull on the roots (ponytails, braids, etc) can damage hair follicles resulting in hair loss. Symptoms of hair loss: …biotin in patient samples can cause falsely high or falsely low results, depending on the type of test, the FDA is particularly concerned about biotin interference causing a falsely low result for troponin, a clinically important biomarker to aid in the diagnosis of heart attacks, which may lead to a missed diagnosis and potentially serious clinical implications Further reading for hair loss: Vasomotor Symptoms (VSM) or hot flashes/flushes affect approximately 80% of women during the menopause transition with the median duration of 8-10 years (meaning half will experience VSM longer than 8-10 years). However, some lucky few never experience them. Hot flashes are essentially the same as night sweats, except night sweats occur at night (go figure). Night sweats are a common first symptom, because estrogen levels are lowest at night. However, those who experience hot flashes during the day may not have any night sweats. Hot flashes are uniquely experienced, so much so that many of us have no idea how to accurately describe or define them. Following is a sampling of how our users describe their hot flashes …. “sort of like a whoosh”, “increased palpitations”, “more headachy”, “uncontrolled sweating from every pore”, “anxious”, “sense of dread in the pit of my stomach”, “sweating only on arms”, “sweating only on feet”, “drenched in sweat”, “lasts only a few minutes”, “lasts for hours”, “cold sweats”, “shivering”, “hot, then cold, then hot”, “swamp crotch”, “internal fire”, “prickly hot” “accompanied with nausea”, “like having a bad sunburn”, “radiating heat”, “sweating in places never before”, “like an electrical jolt”, “like a panic attack”, “like a sudden rash”, “suddenly start/stop”, “occur the same time every night” “everytime I drink alcohol I get a hot flash”, “hot all the time”, “hot only at certain times of the day”, “dripping sweat, but then cold chills”, “sweaty mess!”, “swampy, steamy and sour” …. As an added bonus, our reaction to the hot flash contributes to even more heart palpitations/racing and stress! Hot flashes may also be triggered by alcohol/caffeine/sugar use, smoking, obesity and other stressors. Research indicates that hot flashes are related to decreased estrogen levels which causes our body’s thermostat (hypothalamus) to become more sensitive to small changes in body temperature. When our brain thinks we are too warm, a hot flash occurs to cool us down. As outlined by Dr. Jen Gunter (author of The Menopause Manifesto) in her Vajenda article: With a hot flash, you aren’t feeling hot because your body temperature is rising, what is happening is that you are receiving an incorrect chemical signal that it is! Basically, the call is coming from inside the house. Meaning, your brain has assembled a message of excess heat because it received a signal from the KNDy neurons, and now as far as your brain is concerned (which is all that matters), you are hot and so you feel hot. … …Skin is hot with hot flash because the brain, mistakenly thinking you are hot, starts to deploy the mechanisms to cool down. This involves dilating blood vessels and shunting blood to the skin so you can dump body heat from blood. This is also why many people sweat during a hot flush. Because core temperature was never elevated, body temperature can actually drop after a hot flash because the body has deployed mechanisms to cool off. This is why some people feel cold and shiver after a hot flash. Hot flashes/night sweats can continue for many years (7-9 years according to Dr. Jen Gunter) but some continue to experience hot flashes long into post-meno and into their 70’s or 80s. According to Harvard Health, studies indicate that 30% of women still had hot flashes 10 to 19 years after menopause, and 20% had hot flashes more than 20 years after menopause. The Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), which included 1449 women, found that frequent hot flashes lasted more than 7 years for more than half of the women. Hot flashes/night sweats also contribute to chronic sleep deprivation which affects our long-term health so it’s important to seek treatment to improve sleep quality. Recent research indicates that frequent and persistent hot flashes/night sweats can increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia: For those that cannot do MHT or choose not to, the following are non-hormonal pharmaceutical treatments: The following non-pharmaceutical options may also be effective with varying results: Hot flashes (night sweats) are one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved treatment by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Systemic menopause hormone therapy (aka HRT) (travels throughout the body) consists of estrogen and progesterone (if you have a uterus). MHT is the gold standard for treating hot flashes and, if on the correct dosage, can improve or eliminate hot flashes/night sweats entirely. For some, that change can be almost immediate or it may take a few weeks to notice results. Further reading for hot flash/night sweats: Further studies/articles on herbals, soy/phytoestrogens, and menopause supplements: Here comes reverse puberty! Any unusual change in menstruation should be discussed with your doctor, but if you are in the perimenopausal age range of (40-50), irregular bleeding should not be immediate cause for concern. However, if bleeding is persistent, over a longer period of time, unusually heavy, and/or causing pain then it’s important to see a doctor. (fibroids, cysts, polyps are common contributors) Irregular periods are another common early symptom of perimenopause, and for those who have been extremely regular most of their reproductive life, the disruption can be very alarming. We often associate regularity with optimum health, and when we skip a period or have two in one month, it comes as quite a shock. We assume our periods will get further apart, not closer together! If only we were informed and expected irregular bleeding as part of the normal menopausal transition, it wouldn’t fill us with unnecessary grief, worry or fear. Irregular periods are defined as missed periods, longer/shorter,closer together/further apart, heavier/lighter, flooding, spotting, clotting, and/or dark/different coloured blood. Tracking periods becomes an important tool as it helps to identify patterns and anomalies which is helpful to doctors as well. Everything we know about period predictability goes out in the window in perimenopause, but it should not be cause for alarm. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker” events, where soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. According to Dr. Jen Gunter, Heavy Periods are Really Common in Perimenopause, but it’s important to be aware of ‘super-soaker’ events where any of the following are considered “heavy”: A study analyzed the bleeding patterns of 1,320 women during the menopause transition found that 77.7% had periods lasting 10+ days and 35% had heavy bleeding for 3+ days. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. So, what can be done about irregular bleeding? Further reading about irregular periods: A 2024 comprehensive study (comprised of 482,067 middle-aged women) found that joint and muscular pain were the most common symptoms of menopause, experienced by 65%. However, aches and pains also increase with age, so it can be difficult to determine what is associated to declining estrogen and what is “normal aging”. Estrogen plays a significant role in our muscles, joints, bones and connective tissues. According to the Effect of Estrogen on Musculoskeletal Performance and Injury Risk “estrogen receptors are present in all musculoskeletal tissues, including muscle, bone, and tendon”, and estrogen also plays a role in pain modulation. When our estrogen fluctuates and ultimately declines, we experience new and unusual pain which can lead to chronic issues in post-menopause. Pain during peri/menopause occurs randomly and can come and go making diagnosis difficult. It’s best to track symptoms to determine if they coincide with your own cycles, and/or are affected by stress/anxiety, lack of sleep, exercise, etc. It is important to rule out symptoms as being due to something else, like osteoarthritis, RA, autoimmune disease, etc, therefore diagnosis may involve x-rays, blood tests for mineral/vitamin deficiences, etc. Further reading on joint and muscular pain: A silent symptom of menopause Menopause significantly accelerates bone loss due to declining estrogen; we can lose as much as 20% of bone within the first five years of becoming menopausal. According to the 2022 Endocrine Society, “one in two postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a fracture during their lifetime”. Osteopenia is commonly a precurser to osteoporosis; it is a loss of bone mineral density (BMD) which weakens bones. Whereas, osteoporosis is more severe as bones become brittle and easily break. However, not everyone who has osteopenia will develop osteoporosis. Risk factors include: Symptoms are subtle, we may not feel or notice anything: Diagnosis involves measuring bone density through a duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. The scan is quick and painless and uses a low dose radiation. Doctors do not recommend this test until the age of 65, which may be too late. Since bone loss rapidly occurs once we become menopausal, testing should be performed shortly after becoming post-menopausal - no matter what age. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation recommends that scans be performed as early as age 50. The test reveals a “T Score” as follows: Calculate your Fracture Risk for probability of fracture over the next ten years. The first step in prevention is making healthy lifestyle changes, including: Bone loss is one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved prevention by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Hormone therapy is the most effective for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, reducing risk of hip fractures by 30-50%. A study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT (due to the WHI 2002 study), there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Even low dosage transdermal estradiol can improve bone mineral density in post-menopause. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 417 post-menopausal women found that even an ultra-low dosage of transdermal estrogen (0.014 mg) can increase lumbar spine mineral density. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. For those who cannot do MHT (or choose not to), there are other non-hormonal options available; speak to your doctor. Pharmaceutical treatment options include bisphosphonates and denosumab and SERMS. We can also reduce risk and prevent further loss by doing weight bearing and resistance exercises, which forces us to work against gravity. These include walking, hiking, jogging, climbing stairs, playing tennis, dancing, jumping, using hand-weights, resistance bands, machines, and our own body weight. Researchers from Australia were the first to demonstrate that post-menopausal women can not only stop bone density loss, but a can actually reverse it by lifting heavy weight. Prior to this, studies showed that lifting weights did not work to stop or reverse osteoporosis. These researchers later discovered it was because the women test subjects weren’t lifting heavy enough. Researchers worried that if post-menopausal women with severe osteoporosis lifted weights that are too heavy, they would fracture their bones. However, since that time, their Lifting Intervention for Training Muscle and Osteoporosis Rehabilitation (LIFTMOR) trial determined that twice-weekly, 30-minute high-intensity resistance and impact training (HiRIT) is effective at enhancing bone (particularly in the spine, pelvis and thigh bones), while improving stature and fall prevention. Another consideration is that between the ages of 50 and 70, we lose about 30% of our muscle strength, putting us at risk for falls. We can help minimize this risk by building more muscle mass, but also practising balance every day which helps strengthen our core and prevent falls. Balancing can be done anytime throughout the day; it’s a simple as standing one leg. (for more links to specific exercises, see our Fitness Wiki) Further reading for osteoporosis: Approximately 70% of women experience mood swings, but this term seriously underestimates the impact estrogen has on our brains. As with most of our bodies, estrogen receptors are found in our brains, particularly in the areas that regulate mood and congition. Drs. Mosconi and Brinton recently discovered “the density of estrogen receptors in women’s brains increases significantly over the menopause transition” and that “this increase was associated with memory lapses, mood swings, and lower scores on some cognitive tests in post-menopausal women”. (Menopause Brain is Real) Therefore ‘mood swings’ encompasses many things, including anxiety, depression, anger, sadness, intolerance to situations/people, irritability, loss of self-esteem/confidence, social withdrawal, loss of apathy, loss of concentration, memory lapses (brain fog), etc. The menopause transition also brings about fears and anxiety around aging, “becoming invisible”, losing our relevance, feeling like an outlier, losing direction, and the physical bodily changes to our skin, muscle, hair, weight, etc. We are aging and there’s a certain amount of sadness associated to that. Although many studies about hormone therapy’s impact on moods/cognition are inconclusive and/or suggest further investigation, there is some evidence that hormone therapy can help calm some disruption and help us feel more like ourselves, where we feel well enough to take other steps (seek treatment, exercise, etc.) to manage our moods and cognition. Further reading for mood swings/brain fog: What happened to our ability to fall asleep, and STAY asleep? Data from the National Institutes of Health indicates that sleep disturbances varies from 16% to 42% before menopause, from 39% to 47% during menopause, and a whopping 35% to 60% after menopause. According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, insufficient sleep is linked to the development of a number of chronic diseases and conditions including, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression. Sleep deprivation also affects our reflexes, reduces our coping capacity, critical thinking, and significantly affects moods and memory. Sleep deficiency impacts every aspect of our health and well-being so it is important to address this issue sooner than later. There are a variety of tools and sleep aids available, whether it be prescription medication, OTC supplements and/or incorporating sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques found online, podcasts, etc…the following are some common recommendations. Scientific research for OTC (over-the-counter, non-prescription) options is limited and contradictory. Labels may not accurately reflect the ingredients, and most are only recommended for short-term use. Please consult your doctor/pharmacist before starting any new supplement as they can interfere with existing medications, affect blood labs, or have other negative short-or-long term affects. Hormone replacement therapy (MHT/HRT). Consists of estrogen (estradiol) and a progesterone. Estradiol can help lessen/eliminate night sweats, which may be contributing to sleep-loss, and progesterone (non-synthetic Prometrium), has a calming, sleepy property that helps with sleep when taken before bed. Off-label and/or sleep prescription medication, including antidepressants. Further reading: Why… oh why?! Decreasing hormones does not cause weight gain, but hormonal changes can alter weight distribution, where weight settles around the middle and becomes annoying belly fat. Even those that never had excess weight around the middle before are alarmed at the sudden change. Menopause does not slow down our metabolism but aging does. A Science journal found that metabolism doesn’t fall during menopause, but remains roughly stable between the ages of 20 and 60, but then declines approximately 1% per year after that. Between the ages of 30-40 we start to lose muscle mass/tone (sarcopenia), which accelerates as we enter menopause, losing as much a 8% of muscle each decade. Muscle helps to burn more calories (even at rest) and the less muscle we have, the more fat we gain. According to the Mayo Clinic, by engaging in regular strength exercise we can gain muscle back at any age. According to the January 2024 review on the Importance of Nutrition in Menopause and Perimenopause: The prevalence of obesity increases with age. The incidence of abdominal obesity in women increases with age, and a rapid increase is observed in middle-aged women. Weight gain is a symptom of menopause, experienced by 60â70% of middle-aged women. On average, women gain about 6.8 kg per year during their midlife period (ages 50â60), regardless of their initial body size, race, or ethnicity According to 2022 WHO data, 55% of women are overweight or obese. Health consequences include: There are many other variables as to why we gain weight, such as we may become less physically active as we age, but continue to consume the same amounts as before; our exercise recovery takes longer; we experience increases in overall inflammation; lack of sleep affects cortisol levels, blood sugar regulation (among other things), stress, fear, and anxiety also triggers a cortisol response, which directly affects belly fat. Belly fat has serious consequences for health, especially because visceral fat (deeper fat surrounding our organs) increases our risks for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Visceral fat is considered abdominal obesity when waist circumference is greater than 88cm (35"). According to the American Heart Association waist size predicts heart attacks better than BMI, especially in women. Knowing your waist circumference is helpful to assess risk for heart disease, diabetes and stroke. The best way to do this is to measure your waist. According to the Mayo Clinic, to correctly measure your waist circumference: (you can find visual charts online) The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute indicates that for those in the ‘overweight’ or ‘obesity’ BMI range, a waist circumference of >88 cm (35") have a higher disease risk. Each 1cm (0.4") over 88cm (35") increases cardiac disease by 2%. The National Institutes of Health states that “women who carry excess fat around their waists were at greater risk of dying early from cancer or heart disease than were women with smaller waistlines, even if they were of normal weight”. Knowing weight circumstance also helps to determine a condition called Metabolic Syndrome, and is diagnosed when at least 3 of 5 conditions below are present: It is important to know these levels, so talk to your doctor about specific testing The good news, is that we have the ability to significantly lower these risks. A reduction of 5cm (2") is enough to lower the risk of heart disease by 15%! We can take steps to lose weight, exercise, and take medications to treat any abnormal conditions. Regular exercise may not specifically target visceral fat but studies indicate that high-intensity exercise training (HIET) can reduce total abdominal fat and regular exercise can help keep visceral fat from returning. We cannot specifically target weight loss in one area, but to effectively lower waist circumference, we must consume fewer calories overall and our bodies will decide how and where to lose. Losing weight in menopause is possible, but requires planning and tracking. Focus on healthy, sustainable eating habits over time. Some find success adopting intermittent fasting, where you only eat between a certain period of time (ie: between 11:00 am and 7:00 pm) and the rest of the time only consume water. Others find success following a keto plan or variations of that. The Mediterranean diet for heart health is more plant-based, and incorporates heart-healthy fats and whole foods. There is no special trick to losing weight in menopause. It is simply finding a healthy eating plan and routine that works for you. Avoid anything too restrictive, monitor calories, incorporate heart-healthy foods, drink enough water, get regular sleep –consistency and long-term sustainability are key. The good news is that weight loss is NOT contingent on exercise; while exercise is important for overall health (keeps our bones and muscles strong) it does not effectively contribute to weight loss. So if losing weight and incorporating exercise into your daily routine are things you’d like to change, consider focusing on a healthy-eating routine first; changing lifestyle habits all at once is a lot to take on, which ultimately leads to failure. Once your are comfortable in your dietary routine, then consider incorporating an exercise plan. Ultimately, numbers on the scale don’t matter, extra weight here and there isn’t necessarily a bad thing. A large study from the Ohio State University found that “people who are at normal weight at age 31 and gradually move to overweight status in middle or later adulthood have the lowest mortality risk, even compared to those who maintain normal weight throughout adulthood.” Focus on OVERALL health, not just what numbers say on a scale. The menopause transition is a time to take stock, reassess, and determine how we want to spend the remainder of our lives. Taking charge of our health is empowering and the following are things we can incorporate right now! Quitting smoking, eating healthier, maintaining a healthy weight, de-stressing, sleeping better, etc… are all things we all know and hear so often as the answer to everything, but it is especially important for us during menopause. Symptoms may persist no matter what we try but by making some simple changes, we can help minimize the effects of many symptoms and be healthier overall. Menopause, and living without estrogen, is for the rest of our lives, but by incorporating some of the recommendations below, we can improve our health and quality of life. Quit smoking is one of the most important things you can do. Not only does cigarette smoking increases risk for earlier menopause, it also intensifies symptoms. Specifically, smoking increases risks for frequent and severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). Eat healthier. Cut back on sugars, caffeine, processed food, and introduce more plant-based whole foods, more fibre, more protein, more water. According to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, dietary data from over 50,000 postmenopausal women found that the risk of developing insomnia was greater in women with a higher Glycemic Index diet and for those who had added sugars. Limit Alcohol. Alcohol makes menopausal symptoms worse and increases risk for heart disease, stroke, and osteoporosis. Alcohol is also one of the biggest risk factors for breast cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Maintain weight. Pay attention to waist circumference and not so much the numbers on the scale. (see the section on menopausal weight gain above) Exercise more. Particularly strength training can improve menopausal symptoms, as well as improve bone density, BP, and hot flashes as noted in this 2023 study The Efficacy of Strength Exercises for Reducing the Symptoms of Menopause. Exercise doesn’t always have to be for a long duration, or too rigorous (it takes much longer for our muscles to recover in menopause). It is important to build/maintain muscle which helps prevent bone loss, and practice balance to prevent falls. Dr. Stacy Sims, an exercise physiologist and nutritional scientist suggests the best exercises for women going through the different stages of menopause are, “lift heavy shit - carefully. Do high intensity interval training and plyometrics (jump training). Up your protein. Do less volume and more intensity. Recover longer.” A recent 2024 study on the impact of physical activity on menopausal symptoms found that yoga particularly helped with vasomoter (hot flashes), sleep, joint pain, and urogenital symptoms. Challenge your brain by learning new things (a language, new instrument). Do things like using your non-dominant hand to do everyday tasks (like brushing teeth), do math in your head, learn a new skill. Take vitamins as necessary, when we know we are deficient (often found in medical testing) and/or we are not consuming enough through foods. Overall it is best to get as many nutrients through diet, rather than supplements. Manage mental health by incorporating a variety of techniques, such as acupuncture/acupressure, massage therapy, physio therapy, practising de-stressing techniques (mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing,), picking up hobbies, listening to music, dancing, walking, yoga etc. Essentially find something that you enjoy doing. Try to get consistent full night’s sleep. Whether that means changing to cotton/bamboo sheets, bringing in fans, opening windows, taking prescription medication, CBD or other sleep aids. Lack of sleep contributes to brain fog, body aches/pain, critical thinking, moods, chronic illness…and on and on. Sleep is so incredibly important to our overall health and well-being! Accept emotions, crying jags (for no apparent reason) are normal. Wallow if you have to, stay under the covers, eat a tub of ice-cream and rage against the world, but know it is perfectly okay (and healthy) to give into moments of despair. Don’t beat yourself up when you need to withdraw for awhile. If you are struggling, reach out to others, seek counselling, etc. Monitor, track and document symptoms as this is the best way to see trends in cycles and help make sense of what you are feeling and experiencing. It is also excellent information to share with doctors. Find a good medical practitioner who will listen and is skilled in menopause. This is harder than it should be as most doctors are not trained to recognize symptoms of menopause and understand less about treatment options. (see navigating your medical appointment below for more) Check The Menopause Society (previously the North American Menopause Society) to find a menopausal practitioner near you. Get regular health check-ups for things like heart health, bone scans, blood-work, arthritis, skin issues, eye exams, dental cleaning, mammograms, pelvic exams, etc. Be your own best advocate means that you know your body more than anyone else; your limitations, strengths, and when things feel “off”. Arm yourself with knowledge, read scientific research, take a close look at ingredients of things, collect data and bring it your doctor if necessary. It is empowering to take charge of our own health care journey and instead of waiting for doctors to “do something”, we can use that knowledge to ask questions, demand answers and challenge the status quo. Expect your doctor to know very little (or nothing at all) about menopause and even less about treatment options Doctors are likely less informed than you are and simply do not recognize the signs of peri/menopause. They do a poor job of listening, and are quick to dismiss symptoms as being anything other than stress or anxiety. (What Doctors Don’t Know About Menopause) If under the age of 45, doctors refuse to even acknowledge that it could be perimenopause, they only know that the average age of “reaching” menopause is 51 (which is true), but anything before that (e.g., perimenopause) must all be in your head. Common, lazy and dismissive responses from doctors are: “You are too young to be in menopause” “You are anxious/stressed, here’s a prescription for anti-depressants” “Lose weight, exercise more, do yoga and you will feel better” “It’s normal aging, you’re fine” “Dry vagina? you need to have more sex” “You can’t have hormone therapy until you are menopausal/post-menopausal” “Hormonal blood tests will confirm if you are in peri/menopause” Many doctors rely heavily on the FSH test (hormonal blood/saliva) as their main diagnosing tool. This test does not provide a definitive diagnosis of perimenopause. Because estrogen and progesterone wildly fluctuate during peri/menopause, the test cannot capture anything more than what hormones were doing on that day, which has no bearing on anything. Therefore, a hormonal test taken at one point in time only indicates what your hormones were doing on the one day the test was taken, and are not indicative of what hormones are doing the other 29 days of the month. Unfortunately, many doctors demand this test, claiming that it’s necessary to know levels before they can provide treatment, or to “prove” that everything is “normal”. Doctors just don’t know any better. But for many menopausal clinics and functional medicine practitioners, hormonal testing is insisted upon, because it’s a money-making scam, meant to keep you coming back for more testing while they ‘attempt’ to ‘balance’ hormones. No reputable doctor or menopause society recommends hormonal testing as a diagnosing tool for peri/menopause. Two common outcomes of hormonal testing are: Normal or Post-menopausal hormonal levels are not a true indication of anything. Menopause clinics almost always insist on hormonal testing. They then offer products to ‘balance’ those hormones, tweaking dosages/supplements in an attempt to get hormone levels to fall within certain ranges. Balanced hormones do not equate to optimum health, or have any correlation to peri/menopausal symptoms. The only time FSH testing is beneficial, are for those who believe they are post-menopausal but no longer have periods as a guide (those who had induced/surgical menopause). Then a series of regular/consistent FSH testing may be effective at confirming menopause. Also for younger women (in their 20s or under the age of 44) who haven’t had a period in months/years, then FSH tests at ‘menopausal’ levels, could indicate premature ovarian failure/primary ovarian insufficiency (POF/POI). The British Menopause Society’s stance on hormonal testing: Blood tests are rarely required to diagnose perimenopause or menopause in women aged over 45 and should not be taken. While measurement of FSH has often been used in the past to diagnose perimenopause or menopause, the level fluctuates significantly and bears no correlation with severity or duration of symptoms or to requirement for treatment. Reducing inappropriate use of testing FSH levels will produce savings in terms of cost of test, time for further consultation to discuss the results and will reduce delay in commencing agreed management. Dr. Jen Gunter, author of The Menopause Manifesto states: A screening test can’t apply to menopause because menopause is a normal biological process. A diagnostic test isn’t needed because, medically, we determine menopause has occurred based on one year of no menstruation for someone age 45 or older. (Hormone Testing and Menopause). … Just as you didn’t need blood tests to check on your journey through puberty, you don’t need blood work to track your progress towards menopause. In fact, there is no test that can accurately predict where you are in the menopause transition. And one isn’t needed, because we don’t offer therapy based on hormone levels, we offer therapy based on symptoms and risks for conditions, such as osteoporosis. It is essential for your doctor to review family and personal medical history, including other blood work to determine overall health and risk factors. Provide your doctor with a synopsis of your basic lifestyle, such as smoking/drinking habits, personal history of weight issues, cancers, depression, etc. A review of family history should include: Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancers, liver disease, thyroid disease, heart disease, blood clot disorder, to name a few. Symptoms are what determines a peri/menopause diagnosis, or rather the elimination of those symptoms as being due to something else. Provide detailed information about your symptoms, how they affect your quality of life (are they debilitating, annoying, causing family disruption, relationship issues, causing pain?). Do not let your doctor dismiss your concerns with claims of “normal aging” and/or “a normal” FSH result alone! Many of the symptoms listed above, are found in other illness/diseases, therefore it is important to follow-up with testing to rule out any other potential causes and to get a baseline of your current health. Examination could include a physical exam, weight/height measurements, etc. Blood tests could include liver/kidney function, anemia, fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, lipid (cholesterol), thyroid. Other testing includes mammogram, bone mineral density test, pap screening, pelvic ultrasound, etc. If doctors do not offer further testing for specific symptoms, then request them. Other potential tests to request from your medical professional: Common blood work: What do they recommend to treat x, y, z symptoms? What can you expect from the drug/medication? What are the risks vs. benefits of each? What does it treat specifically? How long until it begins working? Are there concerns about long-term use? What are their thoughts on hormone therapy? If you know you want to try MHT, then it’s important to be direct and ask for it. Doctors will not willingly offer MHT, or they will make every effort to discourage you from pursuing it with claims of “it causes cancer”, “you’re too young”, “you must be post-menopausal first”, etc. (You don’t have to be post-meno before starting MHT, in fact research indicates it’s more beneficial if started during perimenopause.) Be prepared to stand your ground, provide your reasons and directly ask for it. Example: “My symptoms are significantly impacting my quality of life, I’ve read the scientific research, am aware of my personal/familial risks, and believe I am a good candidate for MHT. I would like to trial it for 6 months, after which time we can review.” Other phrases to try: Bring this to your doctor: The Menopause Society’s 2022 hormone therapy position statement (PDF) Doctors hear, “I’m anxiousness, not sleeping, have pain, mood swings/depression”, and immediately jump to prescribing antidepressants and other sleep/pain medications. While these medications may be very effective at treating the specific symptom they are not addressing the underlying issue, which is declining estrogen. While some medications have off-label benefits, such as helping with hot flashes, they also have other side effects and risks which may exacerbate existing menopausal symptoms, cause issues that are also symptoms of menopause, or become addictive/difficult to wean off. Again it’s important to understand what you are taking, why you are taking it, and for how long. Many doctors are fearful of prescribing menopause hormone therapies as viable treatment options, citing outdated sources of increased risks for various cancers, however some OB/GYNs may be better informed regarding the current research on risks/benefits of menopause hormone therapy. (see why doctors are failing women) If you are generally unhappy with a doctor’s assessment and suggested treatment, it is best to find a new doctor who will listen and act. Alternatively, arm yourself with knowledge and go back to your doctor with research, and be prepared to argue your case (see above suggestions on effective phrases, as well as the Menopause Society’s hormone therapy position statement). Oftentimes it feels like it’s impossible to find someone who will listen, who understands menopause and can offer effective treatment options, so it may mean visiting a few doctors before finding the right fit for you. Our Menopause Provider Directory provides a list of menopause practitioners, and some links allow you to search near you. Also it’s important for those who see gynecologists (instead of General Practitioners GPs), to ensure other health factors are considered. While gynos tend to focus on reproductive issues, it is absolutely necessary to have a full body work-up that focuses on other areas as well, especially heart and bone health. The most important thing to realize is that you do not have to suffer. Women tend to put ourselves last or believe we can get through difficult situations on our own, while we silently suffer with aches, pains, sleep deprivation, hot flashes, dryness, mood swings, etc. We need to recognize that we aren’t meant to ‘suffer through’ menopause. Getting three hours of sleep a night is nothing to be proud of, and lack of sleep alone is enough to seriously impact many symptoms as well as our ability to simply function day-to-day. Symptoms can be mild, annoying, debilitating and everything in between, dependent on monthly cycles and/or declining estrogen. There are many options that work, but the trick is to find something that works for you. There are generally two camps on traversing menopause: For most of us starting the menopause transition, we first look to holistic options and supplements to help minimize symptoms. Why involve drugs and invite potential complications from side effects and increased risks? Without prescribed hormones, “going natural” often refers to the use of herbs, vitamins, supplements, over-the-counter hormonal treatments, traditional medicine (acupuncture, etc) diet, exercise, and incorporating comfort items (cooling clothing/sheets, fans, etc). Some women employ a combination of vitamins/supplements, along with prescribed medications such as anti-depressants, sleep aids, etc. While many women find the right balance to deal with some symptoms, there is not enough evidence to prove that any over-the-counter product works. Supplements are not regulated, and there is no requirement to offer scientific evidence of efficacy. They often make claims of higher success rates due to their own in-house low quality studies and/or rely heavily on anecdotal user reviews. Holistic treatments may contribute to an overall sense of well-being and ‘healthiness’, but they won’t specifically address the underlying issue…which is declining hormones. See the sections above for more tips on incorporating methods to help with some symptoms: Disclaimer: The following are common recommendations. Some vitamin deficiencies can be identified with medical lab tests, but dosage amounts should be discussed with your health care professionals (dietitian, etc) for any potential conflicts with diet and/or existing medications. It is important to learn about the side effects and risks of any over-the-counter herbal/supplement/vitamin. Recommended dosages may be at unsafe levels or not meant for long-term use. This list is just a starting point to consider, please do your own research, discuss with your doctor/pharmacist and decide what is right for you. Generally it is best to get vitamins through food consumption as much as possible for effective absorption, but sometimes it is difficult to get enough through foods. Seek out a reputable (and legal) source to discuss your needs The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health provides more information of some herbs listed above. The Menopause Society indicates that now (in 2025), more than 1 billion women worldwide will be post-menopausal. Marketing agencies recognize this abundance of buying power and we are seeing more over-the-counter options (Amberen, Estroven, Remifemin, Menosmart) and online support clinics targeted at treating menopause. These OTC ’treatments’ are marketed at inflated prices and contain a variety of ingredients listed above. Each claim to help with menopause symptoms, however there is limited research to establish their efficacy. It may be better (and cheaper) to buy singular vitamins/supplements, rather than buy a product with a bunch of ingredients/fillers specifically marketed for menopause. Menopause and women’s “wellness” is big business, with the global menopause market size to be worth about US$ 32.7 billion by 2030. Celebrities are talking about it, and menopause is rapidly fuelling women-focused startups, ‘femtech’ companies, tele-medicine, and a myriad of products for anti-aging, hormones, weight loss, cooling devices, etc. More and more online services are jumping into the menopause industry, providing customized hormonal testing and individualized attention for a price. Services are advertised by “trained medical professionals” and “knowledgeable staff”, but this may not always be the case, therefore it is important to thoroughly research these ‘clinics’ before giving them your details and your money. Online services can offer both supplements and menopausal hormone therapy, but we need to pay attention to what type of ‘bioidentical’ hormones are on offer. Many clinics make their own compounded products (hormones and supplements) and insist on hormonal testing before they offer services, as a way in which to keep you coming back for more testing and for more supplement or hormonal adjustments. (No medical or menopause society recommends compounded hormones or hormone testing.) SERMS produce some of the benefits of estrogen, and should be considered for those cannot do MHT (or choose not to). SERMS provide relief for some symptoms but also prevent osteoporosis. Discuss these options with your doctor if you are not a candidate for MHT. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. Hormone therapy, replaces or simply ’tops-up’ our estradiol enough to treat symptoms. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Most people are good candidates for hormone therapy. Dosages and method of delivery varies, but the ‘right’ dose is where symptoms are managed and you feel an overall sense of well-being. Balancing hormonal levels is not the goal of hormone therapy, the goal is finding “balance” in how you feel. However hormone therapy cannot treat every symptom of peri/menopause, so it’s important to have realistic expectations of what hormone therapy can-and-cannot do. (what to expect when starting, or changing hormone therapy) Menopause hormone therapy (MHT), or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is prescribed by medical practitioners and commonly consists of two hormones: estrogen and progesterone. It is necessary to include progesterone if you have a uterus and take estrogen. If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required however, even without a uterus, progesterone may be a good option to include as it can help with sleep. (Synthetic progesterone does not provide sleep benefits.) Both hormones come in a variety of dosages and applications. Some have both estrogen and progesterone combined into one application, while others are separate in two different methods of delivery. Birth Control Pills (BCP) are suitable during early stages of perimenopause to help with some symptoms and when pregnancy is a concern. The hormones in birth control are different than those found in MHT. BCP are generally higher dose, synthetic hormones, meant to ‘override’ your own hormones, and have less customization in terms of dosages and/or method of delivery. Most birth control pills contain ethinyl estradiol (a more potent estrogen) which is not used in hormone therapy. Ethinyl estradiol is synthetic that provides a steady dosage of hormones throughout the day (while suppressing your own ovarian function). Oral BCP (and oral HRT) increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure and stroke. Some symptoms of menopause may not improve while taking birth control pills. Users of BCP can generally continue on this regime until roughly the age 50-55 (speak to to your doctor) and then switch to MHT to assist in the transition. For those in perimenopause, BCP can help regulate/eliminate periods, and lower risk of pregnancy, and can help with some symptoms of perimenopause. In comparision to BCP, hormone therapy are low dosages of hormones (also have many choices of dosages and methods of delivery). The most common, well-tolerated, and âsaferâ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered âbioidenticalâ hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as âbioidenticalâ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day (does not suppress our ovarian function, but simply “tops up” our existing hormones). Transdermal does not increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure or stroke. For those in perimenopause, HRT generally does not regulate/eliminate periods (unless using a high dosage of progesterone or an IUD), does not prevent pregnancy (unless using an IUD), but helps with many symptoms of peri/menopause. In sum… both BCP and HRT contain different hormones, and our bodies may use them differently, so one might work better than the other, but it just depends on the individual (is pregnancy a concern?) and stage of perimenopause. Testosterone (androgens) therapy (pills, patches, implant, gels, injections) is an entirely optional treatment for specific menopause symptoms. Younger women in surgical menopause may need more testosterone than those within ’normal’ menopause age ranges. Many women use testosterone to help with low libido, hair loss, and building muscle, but excess testosterone can contribute to some negative side-effects such as, voice deepening, facial whiskers, and acne. Testosterone is not FDA-approved for use in women, therefore it’s difficult to determine suitable dosages. (more about testosterone, symptoms, treatment, etc below) MHT professionals agree (also confirmed by research), there is a universal ‘window of opportunity’ of when to start hormone therapy in order to receive the most benefits without many risks. More recent research supports starting MHT during perimenopause (rather than waiting until post-menopause) as early intervention provides better outcomes. This window is: Being under the age of 60 - OR - less than 10 years of becoming menopausal. Studies indicate that women over the age of 60, that have gone more than 10 years without estrogen (ten years since their last period) are actually at a higher risk of stroke, heart attack, and dementia if starting estrogen for the first time. However this does not necessarily mean that anyone over 60 cannot use MHT, but much depends on overall health, medical history, and personal risk factors. This means that women who fall outside the window of opportunity must discuss MHT options with their family doctor and weigh their own risks vs. benefits, particularly as it pertains to cardiovascular disease. If hormone therapy is provided to those outside this window, there are indications that the hormone therapy benefits may not provide the same benefits as those who are within the window. This is because a significant amount of time (10+ years) has passed without circulating estrogen, therefore the body’s estrogen receptors may not start working again when estrogen is re-introduced, resulting in marginal symptom relief/benefits. (While science up to this point heavily reiterates the dangers of starting hormone therapy outside of this window, there is a recent call for medical professionals/scientists to revisit this 10 year over age 60 limit.) “Thereâs a window of opportunity,â said lead study author Dr. Lisa Mosconi, director of the Alzheimerâs Prevention Program and the Womenâs Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. âHormones work best for the brain when taken in midlife in presence of menopausal symptoms to support women through the menopause condition.â If a woman began estrogen-progesterone therapy after the age of 65 or more than 10 years after the start of menopause, dementia risk rose, said Mosconi, a neuroscientist. This ‘window of opportunity’ is not the same thing as continuing with hormone therapy after the age of 60. For instance, if someone starts hormone therapy at age 55, and continues with it well into their 60’s and 70’s, there are newer studies supporting the safety and benefits of staying on hormone therapy for longer periods of time. (there may be other reasons, but these are the most prominent) For anyone considering MHT and has had ANY cancer, it is imperative you consult with your medical professional team (GP, gynecologist, endocrinologist, oncologist, etc) to determine if MHT is safe for you. For most people, hormone therapy (MHT/HRT) consists of systemic estrogen and progesterone (or progestin). If you have a uterus, it’s imperative to take progesterone (or progestin) along with any estrogen, as it protects the uterus. The concern is that unopposed estrogen causes the uterine lining to thicken, and this thickening significantly increases risk of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer risk increases when the progesterone dosage is not adequate (not the right dosage in relation to the estrogen) or when progesterone is not taken at all while using systemic estrogen. (If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required, however some studies indicate that progesterone is beneficial for those in perimenopause to help with symptoms, and may provide other benefits even without a uterus. However, for post-menopausal women without a uterus, taking progesterone is shown to have little benefit/value, although it might help with sleep.) Estrogen and progesterone/progestin dosages are dependent on the method of delivery; each has their own benefit vs. risk ratio. Also, the some hormone delivery methods may not absorb as well as another, so it might take some trial and error to find the right dosage for you. Below are some common types of hormones and dosages. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safer’ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered “bioidentical” hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day. In terms of safety, transdermal estrogen is absorbed through the skin where it directly enters the bloodstream. Transdermal does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore dosages tend to be lower, DVT risk (blood clot) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol) but may not have an effect on HDL. Patch brand names include: Alora, Climara, Estradot, Menostar, Vivelle-Dot, etc. These contain estradiol, the main hormone for sympoms of menopause. Dosages vary from the lowest at 0.025mg up to 0.1mg, so it’s often best to start at the lowest dosage and work up to higher dosages as symptoms dictate. Depending on the brand, patches are applied weekly, or twice a week (every 3.5 days). Each brand may contain slightly different chemical properties, so switching from one brand to another may cause some symptoms to temporarily return. (actual patch size and adhesive quality varies depending on the brand) Some patches stick better than others, so the edges might curl and cling to clothing or loosen/fall off when exposed to high heat/sweat. Patch-“dumping” can occur if they get hot/wet, such as when sitting in a hot tub, where the estradiol dumps/releases all at once. For hot tubs, it’s best to remove the patch entirely, carefully place it back in the package it came in, and re-apply after. Covering the patch with something like tegaderm tape can help keep the patch protected and from falling off. Follow the package inserts of where to place the patch, oftentimes the “fattier” the area the better it is for absorption Note: Lately there’s been a lot of discussion on r/menopause and r/perimenopause that some patch brands are back-ordered or not available for extended periods. In these instances, many are forced to switch patch brands, or switch to a gel/spray, or go without their estrogen for periods at a time. Gels are applied daily, directly to the skin. They are spread over an area of skin and left to dry. Drying time is commonly a few minutes, and it’s recommended to leave as much time as possible (at least 2 hours) before showering/swimming. Gels are colourless but may have a slight alcohol odor when first applying, but once spread onto skin it dries quickly. Each brand of gel may have different application areas, for instance Estrogel is commonly recommended to use on arms (wrist to shoulder), while Divigel is applied to upper thighs. Note: Follow the package inserts of where to use the gels Sprays are applied daily, directly to the skin (commonly inside of forearm, below elbow) through a cone applicator. It should not be rubbed into skin, but air-dries within a few minutes. Combined transdermal patches contain both an estrogen/estradiol and a progestin (synthetic progesterone) Because the synthetic progesterone (progestin) is combined in one patch with estradiol, there may be different effects than an estradiol-only patch. A recent study suggests that some women (20%) may be “poor absorbers” of transdermal estradiol, and might require higher dosages to manage symptoms. Therefore, it is important for hormone therapy to be tailored for your needs (symptoms and risks factors), rather than assuming one-size fits all. There is only one systemic vaginal estrogen-only ring which stays in the vagina for up to three months, releasing estradiol acetate. Oral estrogens are entirely synthetic hormones, containing conjugated estrogens, esterified estrogens, etc. Oral estrogen carries slightly higher risks and side effects. Tablets seem to have a short half-life, so tend to ‘dump’ hormones at once shortly after taking it, and then quickly winds down, so it may not provide a steady/consistent dosage of estrogen throughout the day. In terms of safety, oral estrogens have the first pass through the GI tract and liver, therefore they may require highers dosages than those found in transdermal methods, and carry slightly higher risks for DVT (blood clots). Oral may increase inflammatory markers, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and can also increase HDL (‘good’ cholesterol) but might decrease LDL cholesterol. Association Between the Route of Administration and Formulation of Estrogen Therapy and Hypertension Risk in Postmenopausal Women where oral estrogen is associated with a higher risk of hypertenstion compared with transdermal and vaginal estrogens. (Note: Premarin/Prempro oral tablets contain conjugated equine estrogens. Premarin was first introduced in the early 1940s and gained popularity throughout the 1980s. In 1992 it was the number one prescribed drug, and because Premarin has been around a long time, it one of the most well-studied and effective menopause therapies. However, Premarin is made from PREgnant MARe urINe, which involves keeping horses in a perpetual state of pregnancy while confining them in small stalls for long periods of time. Given the inhumane treatment of mares, Premarin has since significantly fallen out of favour.) Progesterone (brand name Prometrium) non-synthetic (‘bioidentical) derived from soy/yams, designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. It is commonly called “micronized progesterone”, which means it has been processed into very small particles, and this makes the hormone easier for the body to absorb and use. Progesterone carries less risk than synthetic progesterone (progestins). There is no known risk of breast cancer with progesterone. (Relationship between menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer) 100mg oral continuous/daily / 200mg cyclical. Micronized progesterone (Prometrium) has a calming, sleepy property and should be taken at night before bed. Vaginal administration of progesterone is off-label use in most countries and may not provide adequate uterine protection, therefore this method should be closely monitored for unwarranted bleeding Rectal use is unknown as well, since much of the science has to do with fertility, not peri/menopause. Also, oral medications may not break down correctly due to the lack of gastric acid, and the coating on the tablets. Using progesterone vaginally (off-label) might help lessen some oral side effects, it’s important to be aware of potential risks. (Note: Prometrium pills contain peanut oil and may cause allergic reaction for those with peanut allergies) Crinone* (progesterone gel) is a vaginal gel containing micronized progesterone in an emulsion system (commonly used for fertility) The active ingredient is either a 4% or 8% concentration. A small 2000 study found that those using vaginal Crinone 4% in cyclical and constant combined regimens controlled bleeding and provided endometrial safety. However, currently there are no large scale studies to substantiate these claims. Progestins (synthetic progesterone) carries a small but increased risk for breast cancer. However progestins provide excellent uterine protection from the effects of estrogen (keeping the uterine lining thin). Hormone Therapy Dosage Guide from the Australasian Menopause Society may be helpful when switching between products and determining approximate dosages of various hormones. It is important to find the right dosage between estrogen and progesterone, not only to manage symptoms, but also to ensure adequate uterine protection. (Inadequate dosages of progesterone may increase risk of endometrial cancer.) The dosages outlined above are standardized and proven to provide adequate uterine protection, dependent on the estrogen dosage and whether or not the progesterone is administered daily or cycled on/off. It may take some trial and error before finding the right dose and method of delivery that works for you, but when it is “right”, it can make a world of difference in how we feel. According to the International Menopause Society’s (IMS) Paper on Menopause and MHT in 2024: Timing of MHT commencement is also a controversial issue in menopause care. MHT has been primarily researched in women who are either post-menopausal (i.e. usually 12 months after the final menstrual period) or, in some studies, in late perimenopause. For those who are menopausal (aka post-menopausal), hormone therapy should be started before the age of 60 and less than 10 years from the last period. (see the window of opportunity for starting hormone therapy). Prescribing MHT in perimenopause can be difficult because the fluctuations in hormone levels can result in episodes of estrogen deficiency rapidly followed by espisdoes of estrogen excess. … MHT remains an option for these women if they are symptomatic, recognizing that MHT is off-label in this phase of life. Considerably more research is needed to determine optimimum MHT regimens for perimenopausal women. Sequential therapies are preferred but even these may cause irregular bleeding. This is likely why BCP are most offered during perimenopause, because “menopause” hormone therapy is considered off-label during the peri stage. BCPs suppress your own hormone production, essentially shutting down the hormonal swings – with the added function of regulating/eliminating periods, while preventing pregnancy. Whereas hormone therapy for menopause are lower dosages to simply “top up” our own hormone production, they do not regulate periods (unless you’re using a high dosage of progesterone/progestin or an IUD), and do not prevent pregnancy (again unless it’s an IUD). It doesn’t mean that hormone therapy can’t (or shouldn’t) be prescribed during perimenopause, it simply points out that this is likely why doctors prefer to go the BCP route for those in peri.for many perimenopausal women, combined oral contraception or levonorgesterel intrauterine devices (IUD) are most often prescribed. Doctors who are willing to prescribe Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) likely follow the adage, “prescribe MHT at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period of time”. Starting MHT at a low dose is generally recommended for those in the average peri/menopausal age range however, if symptoms persist after a trial period, then doctors should be open to dosage increases as necessary. For those in surgical or early menopause at a younger age, it is recommended to start with a higher dose estrogen than for those going through menopause at an ‘average’ age. The shortest period of time recommendation is a bit trickier to identify, in that symptoms can continue much longer than originally anticipated and it becomes difficult to know when to stop MHT, especially if symptoms are managed on the current dosage. Why would we risk stopping our hormones to potentially have symptoms return? Studies indicate that MHT can continue for as long as needed to obtain the best benefits. Essentially as long as we are healthy, monitored by doctors, and re-assessing our risks and benefits at regular intervals, there may be no need to stop hormone therapy at a certain age. According to the International Menopause Society’s 2024 Menopause and MHT paper: There is now universal agreement amongst national and international menopause societies that arbitrary limits should not be placed on the duration of use of MHT. The IMS governing principles state, ‘Whether or not to continue hormone therapy should be decided at the discretion of the well-informed woman and her HCP, dependent upon the specific goals and an objective estimation of ongoing individual benefits and risks’. The Menopause Society’s 2022 position statement on hormone therapy (PDF) indicates that: There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years. The Beers criteria from the American Geriatrics Society has warnings against the use of hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years. However, the recommendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Menopause Society. Of note, the continued use of hormone therapy in healthy women aged older than 65 years at low risk for breast cancer and CVD is limited by insufficient evidence regarding safety, risks, and benefits. The Menopause Society recently published (April 9, 2024) the study: Use of menopausal hormone therapy beyond age 65 years and its effects on women’s health outcomes by types, routes, and doses which suggests the… “possbility of important health benefits with use of menopausal HT beyond age 65 years”. The inserts/medication guides found within MHT packaging contain detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers of MHT. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off MHT. Starting hormone therapy for the first time can feel scary, it is afterall a medication, and something that has the potential make everything worse or increase risks for other things, especially based on those package warnings. Some may have experienced negative side effects with hormonal birth control and come to the conclusion that they cannot tolerate hormones in any form. For the majority, hormone therapy is actually very well-tolerated, with minimal side effects and has the potential to greatly increase our quality of life. Some things to expect when starting hormone (or changing) therapy: As well as helping with many symptoms, research indicates that MHT has a secondary benefit to our overall health as we age. Also, more recent theories suggest that estrogen might play a much bigger role in how we age (more than just losing ovarian function in menopause). Scientists are finding that estrogen affects just about every organ and system in our bodies, and are now just examining the effects of estrogen and the aging process. Below is a sampling of the more common benefits found in multiple studies,but is it important to do your own research as well. Further reading about hormone therapy benefits: As with any medication or treatment, there are side effects and risks. Testosterone is an entirely optional hormone treatment. It is not FDA-approved for women, therefore long-term safety data, benefits and risks are lacking. However, a 1% testosterone cream was recently licensed for women’s use in Australia and perhaps this will prompt others to follow suit. There is a steady decline of testosterone after our reproductive years, but a small increase during menopause. For those in surgical menopause, the drop may be more extreme (50% lower than women who experience menopause ’naturally’). Unfortunately health care providers have not identified a standard “normal” testosterone test level for women. Even if labs results indicate low levels, this may not mean women automatically experience any of the symptoms below. If symptoms are not evident, then low T levels alone is not reason enough to seek treatment. Testosterone therapy is gaining popularity for the treatment of Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FASD) or Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). Indications are that testosterone treatment is very effective for post-menopausal people with FASD/HSDD, but data is lacking for those still in perimenopause. The first line of defence for low libido/decreased sex drive is MHT (estrogen and progesterone). According to the Australasian Menopause Society, “a trial of testosterone therapy may be appropriate for some women whose symptoms do not improve on MHT alone”. Therefore, if there is no improvement after a certain time on MHT, adding a low dose testosterone is recommended. It is important to get regular total testosterone levels checked before and during treatment to help minimize risks noted below. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. There may be other reasons for low testosterone (other than menopause), so it is important to talk to your doctor about other potential causes. Also, oral estrogen therapy can lower testosterone levels. Due to the lack of scientific research and no dosage guidelines for women, it is difficult to get doctors to prescribe testosterone. Compounded pharmacies offer testosterone creams and pellets (implants) but dosages could be at unsafe levels, and/or different levels each time a dose is administered. Further reading about testosterone therapy: Synthetic hormones: are different to what your body produces, and only mimic our own hormones. These are often found in birth control pills and in oral menopause hormone therapy (tablets that contain conjugated estrogens and progestins). Synthetic forms of hormones tend to have more risks/side effects, but may be more effective and beneficial in some circumstances. Synthetic versions have been widely used for many years and therefore have been exposed to more rigorous scrutiny in research studies. (Synthetic estrogens and progestin were used in the 2002 WHI study.) Bioidentical: is a marketing term, not a medical one. These are hormones claiming to be “identical” to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. They are heavily advertised compounded hormone ‘products’ with bold claims of being completely natural, healthier, safer, and better for us. The advertising is slick and convincing, offering us the illusion of personalized and customizable care. Bioidentical compounded hormones are widely promoted by menopause clinics, naturopaths, holistic medicine, celebrities and even endorsed by doctors, which can be misleading and confusing. The confusion is because there are no clear definitions of what constitutes “bioidentical”, or how safety standards are applied to each formation. The term bioidentical is used a lot when describing hormone therapy, but can mean different things to different people, and largely dependent on the source of the hormones, the manufacturing process, and the method of delivery. Therefore, it is important to make the distinction between heavily marketed/widely advertised compounded hormones, and “bioidentical” pharmaceutical,(FDA-approved) hormones, firmly established in medical science. Below is a breakdown of the main differences between science-based ‘bioidentical’ hormone therapy and marketed (compounded) hormones. Bioidentical “pharmaceutical” hormones: are science-backed, FDA-approved hormones, made from a plant steroid found in soy and wild yams (diosgenin), which are then pharmaceutically manufactured by large-scale laboratories. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because (again), this is a marketing tactic, and not a term used by the medical community. However, even though the estrogen and progesterone are pharmaceutically manipulated, they are in fact almost identical to our own hormones. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safest’ “bioidentical” estrogen is transdermal estradiol (found in patches, gels, sprays), vaginal estrogens, and micronized progresterone. Transdermal estrogen does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore DVT (blood clot risk) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol). These hormones are formulated in carefully controlled environments, undergo strict testing standards, are subject to peer-reviewed scientific data, contain precise, consistent and accurate dosing in relation to preventative measures, such as osteoporosis. So while these hormones are not advertised as such, they are considered “bioidentical” in that the hormones are very similar to our own hormone production. Bioidentical “compounded” (marketed) hormones: are custom-made by a pharmacist in a compounding pharmacy. They are also derived from the same plant sources (above) but also include other combinations of miscellaneous ingredients, including less active estrogens (estrone, estriol) and fillers. Pharmacists (or hormone marketing companies) mix special formulations in-house where they use the same “raw” FDA-approved hormones that big pharma uses, but then they mix these hormones with other agents to make up the troche, pill, pellet or progesterone cream. Since each pharmacist (or marketing company) combines their own formulas, the final mixed product is not FDA-approved. There is no quality control or consistency from one dosage/mixture to the next, and for this reason, compounded medications cannot be standardized, tested or FDA-regulated/approved as being effective or safe. These products are heavily promoted as being ’tailored to your own needs’ by popular online menopause clinics, naturopaths, unaware doctors, and functional medicine/nurse practitioners. There is no scientific data supporting the efficacy of these final products. Particularly compounded topical/transdermal progesterone (cream) is not well absorbed through skin, therefore it does not protect the uterus from the effects of estrogen, which can have serious consequences. Even if symptoms improve with compounded hormones, due to the high probability of inconsistent ‘mixed’ dosing, compounded hormones may be at unsafe and dangerous levels. Each time a prescription is filled, the hormone amounts may be different, at risky levels, contain impurities, or not contain adequate dosages to prevent osteoporosis or endometrial cancer. It is important to note that testing hormone levels does not provide this information. As part of their advertised ‘customization’ of hormones, menopause clinics, functional medical practitioners, naturopaths, etc promote regular and ongoing hormone testing to check hormonal levels in an attempt to guide dosing. There is zero scientific data to support hormone testing to ascertain absorption levels, and there is no menopause society that recommends hormone testing as a way to manage estrogen therapy dosages. While both bioidentical options listed above begin with the same hormones (extraction of the steroid from soy and wild yams), the final product from compounded pharmacies is not bound by any inspection process or testing. Overall, there is no truth to claims that compounded bioidentical hormones are safer, healthier, better metabolized or tolerated. There is no research to support they lower risks for breast cancer or are safer than FDA-approved biodentical hormones. Whereas, FDA-approved biodentical hormones are held to high standards, undergo extensive safety protocols, and are scientifically researched, so we know exactly what we are getting, and in safe dosages appropriate for our needs. Bioidentical “pharmacuetical” hormones are safer than both compounded hormones and synthetic oral estrogens, because we have a lot of scientific data to support this. Compounded testosterone was also found to have significant differences in measured concentrations in finished preparations, not only between different pharmacies but also inconsistent mixtures made within the same pharmacy. While Australia is the only country (right now) who offers approved 1% Androfeme testosterone for women, there may not be any other available option for obtaining testosterone outside of compounded pharmacies. Therefore it is important to be aware of the high probability of inconsistent dosing when using compounded testosterone. The American Medical Association states that “given the unpredictable pharmacokinetics of compounded formulations, the use of cBHT cannot be supported in comparison to well-tested FDA-approved hormone therapy options. The Endocrine Society’s statement on compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: “Bioidentical” hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, have been promoted as safer and more effective alternatives to more traditional hormone therapies, often by people outside of the medical community. In fact, little or no scientific and medical evidence exists to support such claims about âbioidentical hormones.â Additionally, many âbioidentical hormoneâ formulations are not subject to FDA oversight and can be inconsistent in dose and purity. As a result of unfounded but highly publicized claims, patients have received incomplete or incorrect information regarding the relative safety and efficacy of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy. … Hormone customization is very difficult to achieve, because blood hormone levels are difficult to regulate accurately due to normal physiologic and pharmacokinetic variations and limitations of readily available assay methods. Nonetheless, proponents of cBHT assert that simple tests of saliva can provide the information necessary to customize hormone doses. These claims are not supported by scientific data confirming assay quality control, standardization, or clinical correlations. The revised global consensus statement on MHT states that: the use of custom-compounded hormone therapy is not recommended because of lack of regulation, rigorous safety and efficacy testing, batch standardization, and purity measures. Dr. Jen Gunter on compounded hormones: It isn’t uncommon to see compounded hormones that are concoctions, a mix of estradiol and estrone and estriol (sold as Bi-est or Tri-est) or with DHEA or testosterone and this is offered as some kind of âbespokeâ mix tailored for your needs. This is a sales tactic. There is zero data that these special mixes do anything, but they are more expensive and give the illusion of customization. … Compounded products are typically paired with lab work that further enhances the illusion of safety. This might be salivary hormone testing (which is useless for menopause in every way as it’s not even accurate, so your provider is literally charging you for a medically worthless test), urine testing, or blood work. I can see how the specialized blood work and the review of the lab work with a provider makes the patient feel heard, and can enhance the placebo effect, but that is all it is. That and wasted money. The Menopause Society on compounded hormones: Custom-compounded hormones are not safer or more effective than approved bioidentical hormones. They are not tested for safety and effectiveness or to prove that the active ingredients are absorbed appropriately or provide predictable levels in blood and tissue. In fact, they may not even contain the prescribed amounts of hormones, and that can be dangerous. For example, when the progesterone level is too low, you are not protected against endometrial (uterine) cancer. When estrogen levels are too high, there can be overstimulation of the endometrium and breast tissue, putting you at risk of endometrial cancer and possibly breast cancer. Further reading on bioidentical compounded hormones: HRT is not without controversy. It is a topic that is debated so often, that we have dedicated an entire section below about its controversy and many commonly held beliefs. The 2004 National Use of Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy report indicates that: In 1975 Hormone therapy prescriptions peaked at 30 million. Prescriptions subsequently declined to approximately 15 million in the early 1980s as evidence emerged showing an increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen use. Prescription growth resumed as progestins were prescribed in combination with estrogen, and prescriptions for hormone therapy reached 36 million in 1992, representing approximately 6 million women.” A hormone therapy history timeline from the Management of perimenopausel and menopausal symptoms The results of the study were immediately released to the media without any customary review or due diligence, resulting in the shocking headline: “HRT Causes Breast Cancer!”. At the time, the NIH director of the study was quoted as saying that the NIH was going for “high impact” with the goal “to shake up the medical establishment and change the thinking about hormones” and in that respect they were successful, as their message doomed hormone therapy for millions of women from 2002 to today. Unfortunately, what was widely reported was exaggerated, misleading or just wrong, but the damage had already been done. Where Are We 10 Years After the Women’s Health Initiative? Hormone therapy has changed since this study. Estrogen dosages tend to be much lower, there are alternative delivery methods, and the timing (when to start hormone therapy) matters. The WHI study’s condemnation of hormone therapy has been long and far-reaching. Most anyone today immediately associates MHT with increased risk for breast cancer, and many doctors still refuse to prescribe it, simply based on findings from a flawed study, 20+ years ago. Hormone therapy does have risks, but more recent research indicates that the risks are not statistically significant as originally reported, and that MHT should be offered as a viable treatment option for symptoms of menopause for women under the age of 60. Estrogen does not cause breast cancer, it may be cancer ‘promoting’, but this is different than cancer ‘initiating’. Breast cancer risk simply increases as we age - with or without hormones. The study found that for the older women there was a 26% increase in the risk of breast cancer compared with those women who were assigned the placebo. This translated to 39 women per 10,000 on MHT, compared with 30 women per 10,000 taking the placebo (9 cases per 10,000 equals less than 1% absolute risk increase). To put this in perspective … the risk of breast cancer for those older women taking MHT, was similar to the risk reported due to obesity and low physical activity. Further, the risk of breast cancer from using MHT was only slightly higher than the risk (found by the same study) of drinking one glass of red wine a night, but less than the risk of drinking two glasses of wine a night. A different 2020 large, observational study found that 3 glasses of milk/day increased breast cancer risk by 80% (even one glass raises risk to 50%) Comparatively, breast cancer risk from hormone therapy is lower than drinking two glasses of red wine a day, or one glass of milk. But yet the ‘hormones cause breast cancer’ fear solidly remains today. The two hormones used in this study were oral conjugated equine estrogens and progestin medroxprogesterone acetate. The synthetic progesterone (progestin) was the hormone linked to the slight increased risk in breast cancer. New research indicates that non-synthetic progesterone does not carry that same risk. Also the risk for venous thromboembolism (stroke) is also reduced when the method of delivery is transdermal estrogen (patches/gels), not oral estrogen. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Breast cancer risk is something we all must all pay attention to regardless, but with advanced early detection screening tools, prognosis is excellent and survivability rates have significantly increased. The more serious issue for menopausal women is heart disease, and we should be more concerned about the higher risks of dying from CVD. The stats for women are scary, according to the World Heart Federation, 1:3 women will die from heart disease, but yet breast cancer still creates far more anxiety. Compared to breast cancer screening, heart disease detection is abysmal. Heart attacks are difficult to diagnose, mostly because health care professionals do not recognize that women’s symptoms are very different than men’s, therefore we are under-diagnosed, do not receive further testing or treatment. Misdiagnosis ultimately contributes to the fact that more women die from heart attacks compared to men. Breast cancer will always be something to watch for, but heart disease is what’s likely to kill us. The good news is that we can significantly lower our risks for heart disease by managing our health (lowering BP and cholesterol levels, increasing exercise, etc) and consider the potential long term benefits of MHT. Interestingly, after women stopped taking estrogen due to the 2002 WHI’s findings, cardiologists noticed a distinct uptick in heart disease deaths in these women, concluding that estrogen is connected to maintaining heart health. Also, another study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT, there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Further reading on hormone therapy: Current recommendations from leading specialty societies endorse the use of MHT in recently menopausal women with appropriate indications. The evidence supports cardiovascular benefit for MHT initiated early among women with premature or surgical menopause and within 10 years of menopause in women with natural menopause. The benefits of MHT (ie, including lower rates of diabetes, reduced insulin resistance, and protection from bone loss) appear to outweigh risks for the majority of early menopausal women. Perimenopausal women should be provided individualized guidance on MHT and options for treatment, particularly when vasomotor symptoms are present. MHT ameliorates most of the traditional CVD risk factors, with different effects, depending on the type, dose, route of administration and type of progestogen. MHT may reduce the risk of CVD events if prescribed within 10 years since the FMP or in postmenopausal women <60 years old and at low-moderate CVD risk. However, MHT should currently not be prescribed for the sole purpose of CVD prevention. For those seeking menopause advice and treatment from gynecologists, it is important to keep in mind that these physicians may not necessarily be skilled in screening for Type II diabetes (which can significantly increase risk for heart disease), cholesterol levels and overall heart function. If your obgyn is not equipped to manage issues of heart care, then it’s important to follow up with another doctor for regular heart health screenings. Hormone therapy is still not widely promoted today, largely because of the continued systemic fear generated from the WHI study, however that is slowly changing. There is a lot of misinformation out there, and unfortunately many doctors continue to perpetuate that misinformation. While we should trust our medical professionals,(why wouldn’t they know everything about our bodies?) we need to wake up to the fact that doctors know almost nothing about menopause, and even less about treatment options. They hear the same fear-based information we do, and are reluctant to bring up hormone therapy, let alone prescribe it. We need to put ourselves first, look at all the options, and find a good doctor who actually understands the benefits of MHT in relation to our own health and needs. Due to the ongoing concerns surrounding hormone therapy, we still do not have significant, definitive research on all the risks and benefits. There is a need for high quality, long-term randomized clinical trials. Menopause is for the rest of our lives; more than one-third (or half) of our lives will be spent in a menopausal ‘state’. We are living longer and quality of life is important as we age. Menopause, and hormone therapy are definitely featured more prominently in news, social media, and advertisements, which is bringing the discussion back to the forefront, with headlines like, “Menopause Hormone Therapy is Making a Comeback” (Mar 2025) and “Menopause is Finally Going Mainstream”. While it’s great to see the shift and recognition, there is still much more to be done. We need to see more studies being done peri/menpausal women, treatment options, and a better understanding of how our hormones work. One such promising study is looking at piecing together the first female medical genome as it relates to ovarian function, after realizing that for women, “estrogen is the central axis of their metabolism and that is why women age in a different way: they age twice as fast (as men) due to the lack of estrogen”. Another recent article (July 2023) by the Wall Street Journal poses the question, What if We Could Get Rid of Menopause?. These are new and exciting developments, and it’s about time that a normal biological process (experienced by half the population) is finally gaining attention after largely going unnoticed for generations. We support accredited academic research and receive constant requests from various universities to survey our subscribers. These include cognitive effects in menopause; experiences of menopause in the workplace; the relationship between menopause, memory and sleep; LGBTQ+ and menopause; mental health care and menopause; effects of estrogen on liver health in post-menopause; chronic pain; menopause experiences on social, personal and cultural levels, and many more! We are all in this together, all one-billion of us! We are the sandwich generation, either caring for young adults, aging parents, and/or providing emotional and financial care to others. We may struggle to get through each day, whether that means maintaining employment, social activities, finding time (and energy) for exercise, proper nutrition, or simply trying to get out of bed every morning. We are worried about retirement, money, relationships, health, aging, our value to society, the future, and the world around us. For many, it may not feel like we are wholly supported in the menopause transition, especially when our main medical establishment is failing us … but we know the tides are changing. As more of us step onto this crazy menopause ride, we become a force to be reckoned with. We must demand more from our employers, businesses, and most importantly, our health care professionals, and insist attention be paid to our specific needs, so that the next generation doesn’t have to say “what is happening to me” or “why didn’t anyone tell me”? Menopause creates a whole new unexpected emotional toll and that’s why it’s important to reach out to others, ask questions and get help. We simply cannot do it all, but we deserve quality of life, and to feel amazing and happy! Finally … know that periods will stop, symptoms will settle down, and we will feel liberated to embrace this next stage of our lives! It is our time.

Title: Nvidia says it will resume sale of key AI chip to China

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: American chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA) says it plans to resume sales to China of an artificial intelligence chip that’s become part of a global race pitting the world’s biggest economies against each other. The company’s announcement on Monday comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House last week. Huang has argued that restricting sales of American technology to China could put the US position as a global AI leader at risk — and the company had also said the restrictions were causing it to miss out on billions of dollars in lost revenue. AMD, another major chipmaker, said on Tuesday that it too was planning to restart sales of its AI chips to China. “We were recently informed by the Department of Commerce that license applications to export MI308 products to China will be moving forward for review,” the company said in a statement to CNN. “We plan to resume shipments as licenses are approved. We applaud the progress made by the Trump Administration in advancing trade negotiations and its commitment to US AI leadership.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg in an interview Tuesday that the Nvidia export controls have been a “negotiating chip” in the larger US-China trade talks, in which the two countries have made a deal to lower tariffs charged on one another. The same day Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the resumption of Nvidia’s AI chip sales to China was part of the trade agreement with Beijing on rare earths. “We put that in the trade deal with the magnets,” he told Reuters, referring to rare earth magnets. China’s controls on rare earth exports became a major focus in the trade talks between Beijing and Washington in London last month. In exchange for increasing shipments of the critical resources, the US also agreed to lift export curbs on microchip designing software, ethane and jet engines. Nvidia is the world’s most valuable company, and last week became the first publicly traded firm to reach a valuation of $4 trillion, thanks to its role in the artificial intelligence market. The company’s chips are used to power technologies ranging from AI chatbots to robotics and self-driving cars. Nvidia released the H20 chip last year as a way to maintain access to the Chinese market — which made up 13% of the company’s sales in 2024 — in the face of strict US export controls. But in April, the White House told the company it would need a special license to export the H20 to China, forcing the company to halt sales. The H20 is widely believed to have contributed to DeepSeek, an advanced Chinese AI model. On Monday, Nvidia said that it had applied to sell the H20 in China again and received assurances from the US government that those licenses will be approved, allowing the company to “start deliveries soon.” Related article Nvidia’s CEO says the US should ‘reduce’ dependency on other countries, onshore technology manufacturing The US government has sought to block China’s use of American technology to advance its military and AI systems. But Huang has argued that if American technology companies are restricted from selling to China, Chinese developers will simply create their own, which could undermine US leadership. “In order for America to be the world leader, just like we want the world to be built on the American dollar, using the American dollar as a global standard, we want the American tech stack to be the global standard,” Huang told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in an interview that aired Sunday. “We love that the internet is created by American technology and is built on American technology, and so we should continue to aspire to that.” The chipmaker said in May that it missed out on $2.5 billion in additional revenue that would have come from H20 sales to China during the first quarter of 2025 and expected another $8 billion revenue loss during the second quarter. Last month, Nvidia said it would no longer include China in its sales and profit forecasts because of uncertainty surrounding export controls. Huang is scheduled to hold a media briefing in Beijing on Wednesday when he attends a supply chain expo, his second visit to China after a trip in April where he stressed the importance of the Chinese market.

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. BioSig Technologies, an innovative medical device technology company, has announced a collaboration with Compliance Exchange Group (CXG) to lead and manage the acquisition of a specific FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer with licensed operations. The move marks a major milestone in the company’s efforts to become one of the first fully regulated Real-World Asset (“RWA”) tokenization companies trading on a major United States exchange, positioning it as the first NASDAQ-listed SEC and FINRA Compliant Issuer of RWA Tokens in the U.S. When the company completes the acquisition of the broker-dealer, it will create an entity with a significant first-mover advantage in the U.S.-major-exchange-traded RWA-backed tokenized investment opportunities for both major institutional and retail investors in the U.S. With this capability, the platform will be able to significantly accelerate adoption and network effect growth of Streamex’s proprietary on-chain RWA commodity market platform. Moreover, the company will be able to continue to seek out other broker-dealer opportunities in other strategically advantageous countries. Following the acquisition, the FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer, with a presence in the U.S., will provide Streamex with the regulatory framework to issue and trade tokenized assets under federal securities laws. BSGM has embarked on the move as its near-term vision is to provide access to fully compliant, gold-backed tokenized assets for U.S. institutional and retail investors targeting the $22 trillion global gold market within the $142 trillion commodities sector, while engaging network-effect-based accelerating growth for the Streamex proprietary on-chain RWA-backed commodity exchange and financing ecosystem. The acquisition will offer Streamex the opportunity to feature among the first Nasdaq-listed companies to issue regulated, gold-backed RWA tokens. Notably, it is in full compliance with both FINRA and SEC regulations, aligning with emerging U.S. digital asset frameworks. Furthermore, Streamex’s Solana-based blockchain enables fast, low-cost issuance and trading of gold-backed tokens, making gold investment accessible to all, with additional commodities markets to come. Also, Streamex aims to hold significant quantities in vaulted gold by 2026, denominating its balance sheet in physical gold to support a recurring revenue model. Following the acquisition, Streamex positions itself as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain, offering a seamless way to invest in physical gold through digital tokens. The platform will allow investors to buy fractional shares of gold with the ease of cryptocurrency, while businesses gain new ways to raise capital. This move aligns with global trends, as institutions like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs tokenize billions in assets, and U.S. regulators begin to clarify digital asset rules. Henry McPhie, CEO of BioSig and Co-Founder of Streamex, commented on the mov,e saying; “The acquisition will be a defining moment for Streamex and BioSig…Acquiring a regulated broker-dealer will help us build the infrastructure to lead the gold tokenization market in the U.S. Our Nasdaq listing and gold-backed platform will unlock unprecedented opportunities for investors and reshape the $22 trillion gold market.” ”Morgan Lekstrom, Executive Chairman of the Company, also added; “Tokenizing gold is the future of commodity finance. Streamex’s regulated approach and public market presence make it a pioneer in this transformative space, with the potential to redefine how investors access real assets.”

A renewed move into hard assets echoes past episodes where cracks in sovereign debt markets triggered defensive positioning. Japan’s bond rout may be an early warning of broader fiscal strain. Unrealized losses on Japanese bonds are mounting, with 30-year yields rising to 3.2% on July 15 in levels not seen before, erasing an estimated 45% of their value since 2019, The Kobeissi Letter wrote in an X post on Monday. Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio has climbed to 235% leaving the Bank of Japan nursing $198 billion in unrealized losses. That erosion of trust in “risk-free” assets is not localized to Japan, but can be seen across other major developed economies. The U.S. 10-year yield has climbed roughly 40 to 60 basis points this year, echoing upward pressure seen in Japan’s bond market. Since the 2020 lows, yields have risen more than fourfold, driven in part by sustained deficit spending and heavy Treasury issuance. “The reality is that global government bond market liquidity is at a record low, now below 2008 levels,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote. “This is exactly why Bitcoin and Gold are surging to record highs.” The flight to hard assets is palpable, former BlackRock executive and XBTO CIO Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, told Decrypt. “Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a macrohedge and structurally scarce asset,” he said. “The next leg up depends on institutional interest deepening as legislative, fiscal, and monetary tailwinds converge." Meanwhile, spot ETF inflows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared past $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. That comes amid a backdrop of high interest rates, combined with “just-in-case” financing ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Even with a bleak bond market, some say the U.S. economy now resides in a “goldilocks-like equilibrium," further fueling Bitcoin’s rally. A closer examination of the spot order book shows buyers positioning at 2%, 5%, and 10% below market, suggesting dip-buying interest remains intact despite fading momentum. That reflects a shift in investor sentiment, which was previously skewed towards asks in Bitcoin perpetuals a few days earlier. Historical data shows that Bitcoin reacted positively the last time such signals occurred. Bitcoin is down more than 5% from its July 14 record of $123,300, with over $300 million in long positions liquidated over the past 12 hours, according to CoinGlass data.

Title: NVIDIA Successfully Negotiates The Resumption Of H20 GPU Sales In China, Unveils A New GPU For The Chinese Market

In a dramatic turn of events, NVIDIA's Jensen Huang seems to have achieved unparalleled success during his recent meeting with President Trump at the White House, winning for his company a dual reprieve in relation to the prevailing restrictions on the sale of American silicon chips in China. Nvidia $NVDA CEO Jensen Huang just said:Nvidia will resume H20 sales to China 🇨🇳 with a new compliant GPU which the US 🇺🇸 has reportedly assured Nvidia it will grant licenses forHere is the full statement from Nvidia:"This month, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang… pic.twitter.com/MKZwdHnplg To wit, NVIDIA has just announced that it is filing an application with the US government to resume the sale of H20 GPUs in China. NVIDIA claims that it has been assured by US officials that it will receive the requisite authorization promptly. As such, the company hopes to "soon" commence deliveries of the H20 GPUs to China. Moreover, NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, has also announced a new, dedicated AI GPU for China - an RTX PRO variant - that reportedly meets the requirements of the Trump administration and "is ideal for digital twin AI for smart factories and logistics." As a refresher, the Trump administration had formally communicated to NVIDIA on the 09th of April that it's China-specific H20 GPU was to be subjected to an "indefinite" export licensing requirement. This development had then prompted NVIDIA to announce charges of up to $5.5 billion for its fiscal Q1 2026 (which concluded on the 27th of April), incurred from writing off "inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves" for the H20 GPU. Additionally, NVIDIA completely wrote off its China-origin TAM following the imposition of US licensing requirements on its country-specific H20 GPU, vowing to treat any residual sales in China as an undiscounted windfall instead of a solid figure factored into its guidance. Of course, NVIDIA has been firing on all cylinders even without the Chinese tailwind. For instance, as per a recent assessment by UBS (detailed here), NVIDIA currently has visibility into a whopping $1.5 trillion in data center revenue! This aligns with NVIDIA's own statement during its Q1'26 earnings call, where it declared that it had visibility into "tens of gigawatts" of AI infrastructure projects. Coming back, while speaking to reporters in Washington DC, Huang just delivered the following remarks: "General-purpose, open-source research and foundation models are the backbone of AI innovation." He went on to note: "We believe that every civil model should run best on the U.S. technology stack, encouraging nations worldwide to choose America."

This has disrupted the global markets and have spread a wave of uncertainties whose chain-effects are clearly visible on the domestic market as well. Moreover, the prolonged geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine continue to act as a deterrent to the demand, thereby adding further woes to the already ailing sector. Going forward, we expect trade activities to be discreet till Trump tariffs are completely rolled out, as this will decide how the industry will navigate with the new tariff regime. Additionally, we will need to monitor the development regarding the India-US Bilateral Trade Talks closely as that would decide the further course of trade activities between both the countries.

With food inflation turning negative (-1.06%) due to broad-based deflation in key staples like vegetables, pulses, and cereals, consumer purchasing power may receive a short-term boost. This benign inflation print could give the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) greater headroom to consider easing. However, with core inflation components such as health and education still elevated above 4%, any monetary accommodation must be carefully sequenced to avoid reigniting price pressures in non-food sectors. The RBI is unlikely to act on the basis of a single data point. But if headline inflation remains below 4%, soft private consumption persists, and there is greater clarity on global developments, a rate cut cannot be ruled out. The tone of upcoming monetary policy statements will be critical to watch.

View from Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Lead at VT Markets. Renewed tariff threats from Donald Trump caused Asia-Pacific markets to open the week on shaky ground. Exporters and supply-chain sensitive sectors were particularly cautious, as equities across the region showed a mixed reaction. Chinese markets continue to balance the risk of renewed tariffs from the US with recent signs of optimism from their own economy after targeted stimulus had a positive impact. Japan held steady as yen weakness offset export headwinds. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar showed resilience, suggesting traders are not panicking yet, and hope that it is just more posturing from Donald Trump before scaling back again. Meanwhile, Bitcoin made new all-time highs, ignoring traditional risk sentiment. The move higher reflects both a hedge against geopolitical uncertainty and growing speculation around new ETF inflows and central bank pressures. Tariff headlines will continue to create short-term volatility in the markets, whilst Bitcoin’s surge may be reflecting broader anti-fiat sentiment, rather than risk-on appetite. We should watch how the markets react to any further developments, and whether they see it as a real threat to the global economy and a potential escalation, or more political posturing from Trump.

Larger-than-expected drop in inflation puts August rate cut back on the table The larger-than-expected fall in India’s consumer price inflation to 2.1% y/y in June raises the prospect of the RBI cutting interest rates further at its policy meeting next month. But given the RBI delivered a bumper 50bp rate cut last month and clearly signalled that its easing cycle was over, we suspect that the high bar for further easing has not been cleared. The headline rate eased from 2.8% y/y in May to 2.1% in June, its lowest rate since January 2019, which was a bigger drop than both we and the consensus had expected (CE forecast: 2.6%; LSEG consensus: 2.5%). We will get the full breakdown shortly, but our Food CPI nowcast suggests that food inflation continued to edge lower last month. We suspect inflation bottomed out in June, but it is likely to rise only gradually towards the RBI’s 4% target over the rest of the year. Underlying price pressures are likely to build further as the economy continues to grow at a robust pace, pushing up core inflation. But, while food prices can be extremely volatile in India, supportive weather conditions should keep them in check over the coming months. In terms of the policy implications, June’s softer-than-expected inflation data – the last set of inflation numbers before the RBI’s next policy announcement on 6th August – certainly increases the prospects of another interest rate cut. That said, the fact that the RBI delivered a sizeable 50bp cut in June and in its communications hinted that the easing cycle was now over by shifting its policy stance from “accommodative” to “neutral” suggests to us that the bar to a resumption in the easing cycle is high. As a result, we are sticking to our view that policy settings will be left on hold in August. And a gradual pick-up in inflation over the coming year suggests that the RBI can leave the repo rate at 5.50% well into 2026. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intelegain.rb Recent Interview...

Ethereum ETFs took 12 trading days to capture over $1 billion in inflows, beating the previous billion mark by three trading sessions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surpassed $5 billion in net inflows on July 11, just 12 trading days after crossing the $4 billion mark, according to Farside Investors data. The milestone reflects a faster pace than the previous interval, when the products required 15 trading sessions to add the prior $1 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) contributed a large portion of the most recent inflows. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that ETHA recorded $675 million in weekly net subscriptions, placing it sixth across all US ETFs for the period ending July 11. He framed ETHA’s weekly haul as a significant moment, noting on July 12 that the vehicle is “hanging with the big dogs for the first time.” The fund closed the week ahead of traditional equity and bond vehicles despite operating in the shadow of larger Bitcoin products. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, absorbed $1.7 billion over the same span. Ethereum ETFs launched on July 23, 2024, and crossed $4 billion in cumulative flows on June 23, achieving this milestone in 231 trading days. The first $3 billion required 216 sessions. By contrast, the jump from $4 billion to $5 billion occurred in just over two weeks of trading, including five consecutive days with total inflows exceeding $200 million. Aggregate daily data from July show that ETHA alone drew $300.9 million on July 10, followed by $158.6 million on July 9 and $137.1 million on July 11. Other issuers such as Fidelity (FETH) and Bitwise (ETHW) posted consistent additions, while Grayscale’s legacy ETHE product saw redemptions. Due to the recent additions, spot Ethereum ETFs now represent over 10% of the total inflows of Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US.

Title: Bitcoin sceptic Vanguard becomes largest shareholder in Michael Saylor's Strategy: Bloomberg

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/14/2025 12:52:53 PM PDT by NoLibZone Despite having called Bitcoin BTC +0.59% an "immature asset class" that is inappropriate for long-term investors, Vanguard Group has become the largest shareholder in Strategy, according to a report from Bloomberg. Through its funds, the $10-trillion money manager owns 20 million Strategy shares or 8% of the outstanding common stock, according to a Bloomberg chart. Vanguard most likely passed Capital Group Cos. to become the top shareholder of Strategy shares during the fourth quarter, the report said. Strategy (ticker MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, has become a proxy bet for Bitcoin as the company's chief business proposition has been acquiring BTC. Consequently, Strategy's share price has risen in unison with the price of Bitcoin, driving other companies to pursue crypto treasury strategies. With multi-billion-dollar spot Bitcoin ETFs issued by Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, and nations all around the world adopting or embracing not only BTC but digital assets in general, demand has never been greater. Bitcoin earlier today hit an all-time high and surpassed the $120,000 level. Also on Monday, Strategy, which is co-founded by executive chairman Michael Saylor, purchased another 4,225 BTC for approximately $472.5 million at an average price of $111,827 per Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 601,550 BTC.

Vanguard most likely passed Capital Group Cos. to become the top shareholder of Strategy shares during the fourth quarter, the report said. Strategy (ticker MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, has become a proxy bet for Bitcoin as the company's chief business proposition has been acquiring BTC. Consequently, Strategy's share price has risen in unison with the price of Bitcoin, driving other companies to pursue crypto treasury strategies.

Title: Vanguard Becomes the Accidental Strategy Whale
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/14/vanguard-accidentally-becomes-largest-holder-of-strategy-stock-despite-anti-bitcoin-stance
Time Published: 2025-07-14T19:47:01Z
Full Content:
Vanguard, the $10 trillion asset manager known in crypto circles for blocking client access to bitcoin ETFs, has emerged as the largest institutional shareholder of Strategy (MSTR), a company whose business model is built around buying and holding bitcoin. According to Bloomberg, Vanguard now owns more than 20 million shares of MSTR — over 8% of the company — surpassing Capital Group as the top institutional holder. The stake is worth about $9.26 billion. "God has a sense of humor," said Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, who has also written The Bolge Effect. "Vanguard chose this life. When you have an index fund, you have to own all the stocks, for better or worse, and that includes stocks that you may not like or approve of personally." "Institutional dementia," said a somewhat less diplomatic Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck. “Indexing into $9 billion of what you openly mock isn't strategy,” he wrote in a post on X. Vanguard's exposure comes from passively managed index funds, not a deliberate bet on bitcoin or Strategy’s strategy. MSTR is included in several of Vanguard’s funds, such as the Total Stock Market Index Fund (VITSX), the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund (VIEIX) and the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG). These funds mirror the composition of broad stock indices and automatically include companies like Strategy when they meet certain criteria. Strategy, led by executive chairman Michael Saylor, has converted itself into a bitcoin holding vehicle, acquiring more than 600,000 BTC worth now about $72 billion since 2020. The company’s shares have become a proxy for bitcoin exposure, especially in the years before the U.S. approved spot bitcoin ETFs. Still, Vanguard remains opposed to the asset class. The firm has refused to offer clients access to bitcoin ETFs, even as competitors like BlackRock launched the wildly successful iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which became the fastest ETF to manage over $80 billion in assets. Even the arrival of supposedly crypto-friendly CEO Salim Ramji in May last year hasn't shifted the firm’s position. “I think it’s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer,” Ramji said after his appointment.

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. The US Capitol as Washington hosts 'Crypto Week' (Photo by Mandel NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL ... More NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Bitcoin’s price reached a historic high early Monday morning, July 14, capping off a weekend rally fueled by record ETF inflows, investor optimism, and growing institutional interest. The milestone coincides with “Crypto Week” in Washington, D.C., where lawmakers are split between advancing pro-crypto legislation and spotlighting “blatant corruption,” as Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters put it, tied to the Trump administration’s digital asset involvement. The data aggregation site CoinMarketCap indicated that bitcoin’s price rally peaked at $123,091.61 early morning on July 14, 2025, setting a new all-time high. Bitcoin’s price has now gained more than 30% since January, rebounding from an April low of just above $75,000. Institutional inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds have bolstered the surge and the anticipation of pro-crypto legislation in Congress. ETH, Sol, XRP, among other top cryptocurrencies, also posted gains so far this year. The total crypto market capitalization now stands at approximately $3.8 trillion. On Thursday alone, bitcoin ETFs saw $1.18 billion in net inflows — the largest single-day total of 2025. Funds such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF have played a key role in driving mainstream access to the asset. In a post on X, Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, noted that because of “recent flows and the overnight rally, [the fund] Bitcoin policy momentum includes the Generational Economic National Innovation for U.S. Strategy, known as the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill that introduces the first federal framework for regulating stablecoins. The GENIUS Act cleared the Senate Banking Committee last month and is expected to continue making progress this week in the House of Representatives. The GENIUS Act defines payment stablecoins as digital assets that must be redeemable at a fixed value, like one U.S. dollar. Issuers are required to back each stablecoin with an equal amount of approved reserve assets, such as Treasury bills, insured bank deposits, or central bank reserves. These reserves can only be used for redemptions or specific collateralized transactions. Issuers must follow rules on capital, liquidity, and risk management but are exempt from traditional bank capital requirements. They must also provide clear redemption policies, disclose reserve holdings, and undergo third-party audits. Those with over $50 billion in circulation must submit annual audited financial statements. The bill also bans interest payments on stablecoins and imposes strict anti-money-laundering and sanctions compliance, with restrictions on executives with financial crime convictions. Banks, credit unions, or qualified nonbanks can issue stablecoins. Issuers with over $10 billion must operate under federal oversight, while smaller nonbanks may opt for a state-based regime if it aligns with federal standards. The bill outlines rules for foreign stablecoins and allows their use if regulatory standards are met. Custodians must keep customer funds separate from their own, and banks can use blockchain to manage stablecoin services. In the event of bankruptcy, stablecoin holders are prioritized for repayment. The bill clarifies that payment stablecoins are not securities or commodities and prohibits misleading marketing or bundling. Senior federal officials must disclose stablecoin holdings above $5,000. Bitcoin’s rally arrives during what has been dubbed “Crypto Week” in Washington, a series of policy hearings, roundtables, and advocacy events across Capitol Hill focused on the digital asset economy. “We are taking historic steps to ensure the United States remains the world’s leader in innovation, and I look forward to ‘Crypto Week’ in the House,” said Rep. French Hill, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, in a public statement. Among the events scheduled are a House Ways and Means hearing on crypto tax policy, a Dodd-Frank retrospective touching on decentralized finance, and ongoing closed-door meetings between Senate staff and industry stakeholders. At the same time, Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee have launched a coordinated effort labeled “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week,” aimed at countering what they describe as “regulatory capture” by the Trump administration and ethical lapses related to digital assets. Waters is leading the Democratic campaign, which includes public statements, investigative memos and proposed legislation. President Donald Trump’s memecoin initiatives are a main focus of these criticisms from Democrats. The collectible $TRUMP coin, launched in early 2025, has been promoted by individuals associated with the Trump campaign and has drawn scrutiny over its financial and political implications. Trump has aggressively embraced bitcoin and other digital assets during his second term. In March, he issued an executive order creating a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” also stating that he is “very positive and open-minded to cryptocurrency companies, and all things related to this new and burgeoning industry. Our country must be the leader in the field.” The Trump administration’s recent actions, including the removal of key Securities and Exchange Commission staff focused on digital asset enforcement, have raised questions about whether regulatory safeguards are being scaled back. At the same time, the administration’s pro-crypto stance has been viewed by some in the industry as a potential catalyst for U.S. leadership in digital innovation. Still, the alignment presents a cultural tension. While the Bitcoin ecosystem promotes decentralization and resistance to centralized control, the political branding surrounding Trump often emphasizes hierarchy, loyalty, and singular leadership. Despite growing controversy, bitcoin’s climb to $123,000 marks one of the fastest in its 16-year history. After reaching $100,000 in December and $110,000 by late May, the price of bitcoin grew another $13,000 in just 53 days. The rally follows a volatile first half of 2025, including a sharp April dip driven by regulatory uncertainty and rising Treasury yields. Renewed ETF inflows and clearer policy signals have since reignited momentum. This new high is more than a market milestone. It highlights the expanding role that bitcoin plays in the financial system, even with the intensified debates over how digital assets should be regulated. The rally has reinforced the view that bitcoin is moving closer to mainstream financial use cases. Whether the GENIUS Act can provide lasting structure, or whether political infighting and memecoin speculation undercut trust, may become clearer in the weeks ahead. Bitcoin’s record-setting price arrives at a pivotal moment for United States crypto policy. As lawmakers debate comprehensive regulation and examine political connections to the industry, the market appears to be pricing in long-term legitimacy. What happens next in Washington could shape the future of bitcoin and the broader digital asset economy.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT becomes top 20 ETF in US, poised to exceed $100 billion in assets this month

Market analysts noted that BTC rally is pushing the BlackRock's ETF towards unprecedented $100 billion asset mark. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is on track to surpass $100 billion in assets this month, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In a June 14 post on X, Balchunas noted that while he previously projected the fund, IBIT, could hit the $100 billion mark this summer, it could happen even sooner. He highlighted that the ETF has already reached $88 billion in assets thanks to recent inflows and BTC’s overnight rally above $120,000. He pointed out that the current AuM places the fund as the 20th largest ETF in the US and the 7th largest for BlackRock. Remarkably, it is also the asset manager’s most profitable ETF, even though it is just 1.5 years old. Observers pointed out that the recent price surge in Bitcoin would further spark renewed momentum and drive institutional capital into the fund. Bitcoin analyst Kiwi said: “This week could mark a massive shift in allocation to BTC/IBIT should this pump continue – the money on the sidelines isn’t retail – it’s smart money. Hw long can they sit by and watch this train roll past without action? The career risk to not owning a substantial amount of Bitcoin is getting larger by the hour.” Data from SoSo Value shows $IBIT’s cumulative net inflows reached $54.40 billion as of July 11. The ETF now holds more than 705,000 BTC, which is roughly 3.6% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Apple’s C-suite undergoes major reshuffle — here’s what it means for CEO Tim Cook
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/14/business/what-apples-c-suite-reshuffle-means-for-ceo-tim-cook/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T14:30:22Z
Full Content:
Apple has quietly undergone a major restructuring of its management team that has sparked speculation about the future of the world’s third most valuable company — but CEO Tim Cook isn’t going anywhere. Even as the iPhone maker faces mounting challenges — from AI stumbles to fading product innovation — the 64-year-old chief executive retains firm control of the company founded by Steve Jobs, even as most of his direct reports are nearing retirement age. And with longtime lieutenant Jeff Williams set to retire later this year, Cook’s leadership appears more entrenched than ever, according to Bloomberg News. Williams, Cook’s most trusted deputy, will exit in December. Sabih Khan, Apple’s senior vice president of operations, who is in his late 50s, is slated to assume the COO title. Meanwhile, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri has been succeeded by Kevan Parekh, and longtime product executive Dan Riccio departed at the end of last year. The company is seeing its biggest management shake-up in decades. Nearly half of Cook’s approximately 20 direct reports are in their 60s and nearing retirement, including senior figures like marketing chief Greg Joswiak, App Store head Phil Schiller, environment executive Lisa Jackson and chip executive Johny Srouji. Cook, meanwhile, who turns 65 in November, has shown no signs of stepping down or preparing a successor. The departure of Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer and widely seen as Cook’s natural heir, leaves the company without a clear backup plan, Bloomberg News reported. It also reinforces Cook’s position as the indispensable figure guiding Apple through turbulent times. Williams was uniquely positioned as both COO and unofficial backup CEO. Khan, while assuming the title, lacks the breadth of experience and institutional knowledge to immediately step in as chief executive, according to Bloomberg News. The situation is drawing industrywide comparisons to other long-tenured corporate leaders like Disney’s Bob Iger and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, who have extended their influence well past traditional retirement age. For Cook, whose tenure as CEO began in 2011, the prospect of remaining at Apple’s helm for another five years is increasingly likely as there is little urgency from Apple’s board to initiate a transition, Bloomberg News reported. The directors — longtime allies including Arthur Levinson, Susan Wagner and Ronald Sugar — have largely deferred to Cook, who has delivered a staggering 1,500% increase in Apple’s stock price since succeeding Steve Jobs. Though shares are down 16% in 2025, Cook remains the board’s trusted operator during a period of technological and cultural flux. Under his watch, Apple expanded into China, launched successful new product lines like the Apple Watch and AirPods and transitioned into a subscription-driven business. These achievements, however, are being challenged by Apple’s growing design stagnation, lagging AI performance and mounting criticism from developers and regulators. While rivals like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI rolled out advanced AI capabilities early, Apple is seen as trailing far behind. Its flagship initiative, “Apple Intelligence,” launched significantly later than competing products and still lacks several features that were promised during its 2024 debut. Still, there is no indication that the board is losing confidence, according to Bloomberg News. Inside Apple, Services head Eddy Cue has reportedly warned that the company risks becoming “the next BlackBerry or Nokia” if it fails to pivot quickly. Those concerns, coupled with the AI backlash, have prompted a reorganization of the org chart and the beginnings of a strategic reset. In order to right the ship, some have floated acquiring a top-tier AI startup and grooming its CEO for the top job. But insiders dismiss that possibility outright. Apple has reportedly explored acquisitions of companies like Perplexity and is considering Mistral, highlighting its increasing urgency in the AI arms race. The recent loss of Ruoming Pang, Apple’s foundation models chief, to Meta in a deal reportedly worth more than $200 million, only underscores the stakes. Despite the leadership uncertainty, Apple has a slate of new products on the way, including updated iPhones, iPads and a refreshed Vision Pro headset. But the changes are largely incremental — spec bumps rather than groundbreaking innovation, according to Bloomberg News. In the absence of revolutionary hardware or AI breakthroughs, the question of Cook’s eventual exit– and what comes after — continues to loom over Cupertino. For now, however, the CEO remains firmly in charge. And with no clear successor in place, the company’s future is still very much Cook’s to shape. The Post has sought comment from Apple.

Title: This is what fiat death looks like. Bitcoin’s 1,500% boom paves the path to Hyperbitcoinization

Hyperbitcoinization looms as Bitcoin climbs financial ranks with sovereign and corporate backing. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin has outpaced traditional benchmarks since 2020, registering gains exceeding 1,500%, while gold advanced roughly 115% and the U.S. Dollar Index remained nearly flat. The divergence in asset performance reflects a period of monetary expansion, persistent inflation concerns, and evolving perceptions of scarce, non-sovereign assets as institutional investors and sovereign entities re-evaluate reserves and portfolio allocations. Bitcoin climbed from price levels near $7,700 in early 2020 to intraday highs around $123,164 today, driven partly by a weak dollar and spot exchange-traded funds in the United States that removed barriers to institutional participation. As BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exceeded 700,000 BTC in holdings and surpassed $88 billion in assets under management, the asset class has been increasingly woven into regulated investment products. Institutional access is regarded as creating a price floor while mitigating the volatility traditionally associated with digital assets. Gold’s upward trajectory continued through the same period, rising from around $1,550 per ounce to over $3,300, as geopolitical tensions and inflation protection strategies preserved demand for physical assets. Meanwhile, the dollar’s relative value against other currencies remains flat after substantial volatility, and its purchasing power has eroded by an estimated 20% cumulatively from 2020 to 2025 due to inflation. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic policy responses in 2020 fueled an expansion of monetary supply and fiscal interventions unprecedented in modern history, prompting market participants to seek stores of value beyond fiat. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature positioned it as both a speculative vehicle and a potential hedge, capturing capital from investors diversifying away from sovereign currency exposure. Bitcoin’s acceleration has led many to explore the thesis of Hyperbitcoinization, where it might replace fiat currencies as a primary medium of exchange and store of value. While the prevailing analyses maintain this scenario remains improbable in the near term, today’s environment mirrors how fiat currencies’ fall would start. Bitcoin has become a macro asset comparable to gold rather than an imminent replacement for the dollar. Regulatory frameworks, taxation requirements mandating fiat settlement, and the economic risk of deflation inherent in fixed-supply monetary systems remain substantial hurdles to Bitcoin fully supplanting traditional currencies. Institutions and governments have nonetheless integrated Bitcoin into treasury strategies. As CryptoSlate has reported, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi disclosed a $439 million position in Bitcoin ETFs. In the United States, President Trump signed an executive order initiating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, signaling official sector interest in holding Bitcoin alongside traditional reserves. Further complicating the outlook, U.S. trade policy in 2025 has introduced tariffs on major trading partners, contributing to inflationary pressures and leading to a decline of around 10% in the dollar index year-to-date. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink cautioned in public statements that persistent fiscal deficits and the risk of dollar debasement could elevate digital assets like Bitcoin as alternatives, reflecting sentiment from parts of the financial establishment that Bitcoin’s role is shifting from speculative asset to strategic reserve. Currently, the total US debt stands at $37 trillion and rising, while the dollar is in a precarious position. However, surging institutional adoption has coincided with declining evidence of grassroots activity. While on-chain throughput broke above 500,000 transfers a day several times in 2025, Lightning Network capacity has remained relatively flat around 5,000 BTC since mid-2022. Further, the past few months have seen a slight drop in capacity to around 4,300 BTC, according to mempool.space. Though the Lightning Network is not the only way to move Bitcoin on-chain cheaply, numerous layer-1s host forms of wrapped Bitcoin, which are used regularly across multiple chains. Transfers below $1,000 do make up more than half of the total on-chain Bitcoin volume, pointing to peer-to-peer settlement rather than exchange consolidation. Those metrics, paired with ETF inflows, corporate treasury adoption, Abu Dhabi’s allocation, and the U.S. strategic reserve order, create a picture that matches the early stage of Hyperbitcoinization: fiat dilution, a stronger Bitcoin price, and the first migration of day-to-day transactions onto a rival monetary rail. If throughput on Lightning and other layers widens further, the framework for mass transactional adoption will be in place, and Bitcoin’s role will move from balance-sheet hedge to usable money. That transition is underway, but the focus remains on acquiring Bitcoin rather than integrating Bitcoin as a technological tool to revolutionize TradFi. Still, maybe that’s not what we need right now. If the corporate world relies on Bitcoin for its store of value, placing that value in Lightning Channels to earn yield or staking it to secure other blockchains becomes an enticing offer. From there, using Bitcoin to secure critical infrastructure and building tech stacks around Bitcoin’s immutable global timestamping service is a logical next step. At that point, Bitcoin becomes not only the best store of value but the catalyst to secure and integrate that value into the entire digital world.

Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury trend-setter, Strategy, has resumed its relentless quest for accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) after a brief pause during the first week of this month. The company added another 4,225 Bitcoins to its treasury in the last week as the price of Bitcoin soared to new all-time highs. Strategy now holds over 600,000 BTC, further solidifying its position as the world’s largest Bitcoin corporate holder. Strategy, the world’s largest public holder of Bitcoin (BTC), disclosed in a Monday 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had snagged an additional 4,225 BTC for approximately $472.5 million at an average price of $111,827 per coin between July 7 and July 14. Strategy now holds 601,550 BTC acquired for $42.87 billion at an average price of $71,268 per Bitcoin. At the alpha crypto’s current market price of around $121,795, the company’s BTC stack is valued at over $73 billion. That’s equivalent to nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply. Strategy has acquired 4,225 BTC for ~$472.5 million at ~$111,827 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 20.2% YTD 2025. As of 7/13/2025, we hodl 601,550 $BTC acquired for ~$42.87 billion at ~$71,268 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRDhttps://t.co/HhlFIy1m3H The latest acquisition was made using $331 million of net proceeds from sales of its Class A common stock, MSTR, under its at-the-market (ATM) program, $71.1 million from STRK preferred shares, $55.3 million from STRF preferred shares, and $15.0 million from STRD preferred shares. These sales collectively yielded $472 million in net proceeds to fund Strategy’s BTC purchase. Strategy’s recent Bitcoin buy comes amid Bitcoin setting a record high above $112,000 last Wednesday. After beginning the week hovering around $108K, the BTC price rocketed to $118,000 highs by July 13. The world’s oldest and largest crypto has continued its parabolic surge today, setting a new all-time high of $122,838, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. As Bitcoin registered its strong upsurge, Saylor has continued voicing his uber-bullish sentiment on the X platform. “It’s going up forever, Laura,” the Strategy co-founder asserted while responding to Unchained’s founder, Laura Shin, who had commented about BTC smashing the $119K mark on Sunday. It's going up forever, Laura. Strategy’s Bitcoin investment comes as a growing number of public companies and other entities have disclosed new Bitcoin acquisitions. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, there are now 141 publicly traded firms that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in a bid to emulate Strategy, which started snapping up the asset under the leadership of Michael Saylor back in 2020. Metaplanet, which touts itself as the “Strategy of Japan”, recently raised its Bitcoin stash to 15,555 BTC, worth over $1.7 billion. Semler Scientific, Trump Media, and GameStop are among other companies that have recently announced Bitcoin acquisition plans.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is on a tear. Bitcoin rocketed past $120,000 for the first time in history to notch a new all-time high of nearly $123,000 early Monday morning, according to data from Binance. The cryptocurrency posted a daily jump of about 3% and a weekly gain of more than 12%. Bitcoin’s Monday surge follows a string of recent highs. After hovering under $110,000 for more than a month, it notched new records on Thursday and through the weekend amid a corresponding rally in the stock market. Bitcoin’s jump in price also comes amid a glut of demand from institutional investors, who are more likely to invest in crypto through digital asset products offered by established Wall Street firms. Crypto ETFs from the asset management giant BlackRock saw an influx of more than $2.4 billion over the past week, according to data from the crypto investment firm CoinShares. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose nearly 3% over the past day to shoot past $3,000. It’s up 20% in the past week. Despite the gains from the two largest cryptocurrencies, the total market capitalization of all digital assets was down 0.5% day-over-day to about $3.87 trillion. In total, crypto ETFs recorded an inflow of $3.7 billion last week, the second-largest week on record, according to CoinShares. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, attributed the booming demand for Bitcoin to “political developments and signals from the Federal Reserve.” On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve released minutes for its June meeting. Officials largely agreed that there would be cuts in interest rates sometime this year. “Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate,” read the summary of the meeting. Meanwhile, positive political developments for crypto in Congress buoyed investor enthusiasm, said Butterfill. The House is set to vote this week on the GENIUS Act, a bill that would regulate stablecoins, which the Senate passed in June. It is also set to vote on the CLARITY Act, legislation that would specify how U.S. financial agencies should regulate digital assets writ large. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Ethereum to hit $1.5 million? Top investor predicts mind-blowing 100x surge with new ETFs

Ethereum price prediction is making headlines after EMJ Capital's Eric Jackson forecasted that ETH could reach $1.5 million per token over time. With Ethereum staking ETF approval likely before October, Jackson believes the real price rally hasn't even started. He points to Ethereum's growing use by major companies like Coinbase and Shopify, deflationary token supply, and increasing demand from traditional finance. Jackson says this shift could make Ethereum a “100-bagger” asset. With ETH currently trading around $3,040, his base case targets $10K by 2026. If adoption and staking take off, ETH’s long-term value could surprise everyone.

Title: Google Stock To $350?

Time Published: 2025-07-14T13:03:59Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 10 July 2025, Berlin: The Google logo can be seen on a small door at the stable guard party. Photo: ... More Jens Kalaene/dpa (Photo by Jens Kalaene/picture alliance via Getty Images) Google stock has already achieved remarkable gains, growing 2x from $88 levels in early 2023 to approximately $180 at present. But what could drive the stock to double from its current levels over the coming years? The answer is rooted in AI and cloud computing– the main growth engine for Google. Google Cloud has shown strong performance, with an average revenue growth of 31% over the last three years. This positive trend is anticipated to continue, with sales expected to average over 20% annually for the next three years. The substantial demand for cloud computing services is primarily driven by the growing AI boom, as companies increasingly utilize Google Cloud to quickly implement and scale their AI projects. Additionally, if you are looking for more stability than investing in an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. Also, see – Trump’s Russia Math, Simplified Point is, Google has a lot going for it. It also happens to be part of Trefis HQ portfolio strategy that has about 30 stocks. HQ has outperformed S&P and returned >90% since inception. Consider: how much of Google stock is in your retirement portfolio? Talk to an adviser if you’d like to learn about HQ strategy or to see if Google should be part of your portfolio. For Google stock to double from current levels, the company needs consistent revenue growth of around 15-20% annually along with margin expansion. This seems attainable through: The convergence of these elements, particularly the AI revolution and growth in cloud computing, opens multiple avenues for Google to meet the performance required to double its stock price over the next 3-5 years. We anticipate Google’s revenues to surpass $500 billion within the next three years, with earnings likely to nearly double due to improved profitability. Currently, GOOG stock trades around $180, pricing it at roughly 20 times its trailing earnings. This is considerably lower than some of its competitors, with Amazon trading at 36 times and Microsoft at 39 times earnings. Given Google’s deep integration of AI and its enhancing profitability, we foresee an upward revision in its valuation multiple. Even if the stock holds a similar valuation, it could exceed $300 within the next three to four years. If investors assign a higher multiple, it would signify more than a twofold increase from current levels. Also see – Alphabet's Valuation Ratios Comparison. Google’s leading position in search, its dominance in digital advertising, and its expanding presence in cloud computing and AI infrastructure offer multiple levers for long-term value creation. This revaluation, supported by accelerating growth in high-margin segments like Google Cloud and YouTube, underpins the potential for the stock to double as markets reassess Alphabet’s earnings potential in an AI-driven economy. Alphabet’s core advertising operations, combined with strategic investments in AI, cloud services, and autonomous technologies, create a well-diversified and resilient growth engine. If these sectors maintain their current trajectory, the stock could see significant upside, driven by both revenue growth and improving operating leverage. While Google’s outlook is promising, several variables could hinder its stock from doubling. Firstly, escalating competition in critical sectors presents a threat. In cloud computing, Google Cloud faces stiff competition from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, which could pressure its margins and growth rates. Also see – MSFT Stock To $1,000? Likewise, in the rapidly advancing AI sector, rivals such as OpenAI (with ChatGPT) and Perplexity are challenging Google’s dominance in search through AI-driven methods. Secondly, regulatory scrutiny and antitrust actions are considerable concerns. Google is already confronting legal challenges regarding its market dominance in online search and digital advertising. Ongoing probes, including a recent preliminary investigation into its collaboration with Character.AI, underscore a growing regulatory interest in potential anti-competitive behavior, particularly in the emerging AI ecosystem. These developments could restrict expansion, result in hefty fines, or even compel business restructuring. Related – Google’s $1 Trillion Lawsuit Thirdly, Google’s substantial AI capital expenditures carry execution risks. The company plans to invest around $75 billion in technical infrastructure in 2025 to bolster AI and business growth. If these significant investments do not yield anticipated returns or take excessively long to materialize, investor sentiment may turn unfavorable. Finally, macroeconomic factors could influence Google’s performance. Economic recessions could curtail advertising investments across its search and YouTube platforms, as well as enterprise cloud spending. For more details, see – Buy or Sell GOOG Stock? Moreover, high interest rates could render growth stocks like Google less attractive than fixed-income options, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm. Investors contemplating Google stock should carefully evaluate these potential risks. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while building the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, comprising 30 stocks, has a strong record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: BSGM Engages CXG to Acquire FINRA/SEC-Registered Broker-Dealer to Expand Publicly Traded RWA Tokenization Operations
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/14/bsgm-engages-cxg-to-acquire-finra-sec-registered-broker-dealer-to-expand-publicly-traded-rwa-tokenization-operations/

July 14, 2025 – Los Angeles, United States BioSig Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: BSGM) (‘BioSig’), which recently merged with Streamex Exchange Corporation (‘Streamex’) (together, ‘BSGM’ or the ‘Company’), is excited to announce a critical step toward becoming one of the first fully regulated RWA tokenization companies trading on a major US exchange. Streamex has engaged Compliance Exchange Group (CXG) to lead and manage the acquisition of a specific FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer with licensed operations. Management notes that the near-term vision is to provide access to fully compliant, gold-backed tokenized assets for US institutional and retail investors targeting the $22 trillion global gold market within the $142 trillion commodities sector, while engaging network-effect-based accelerating growth for the Streamex proprietary on-chain RWA-backed commodity exchange and financing ecosystem. Near term, the acquisition positions Streamex to bridge TradFi (traditional finance) and blockchain, offering a seamless way to invest in physical gold through digital tokens. Investors can buy fractional shares of gold with the ease of cryptocurrency, while businesses gain new ways to raise capital. This move aligns with global trends, as institutions like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs tokenize billions in assets, and US regulators begin to clarify digital asset rules. Henry McPhie, CEO of BioSig and co-founder of Streamex, said, “The acquisition will be a defining moment for Streamex and BioSig. “Acquiring a regulated broker-dealer will help us build the infrastructure to lead the gold tokenization market in the US. “Our Nasdaq listing and gold-backed platform will unlock unprecedented opportunities for investors and reshape the $22 trillion gold market.” Morgan Lekstrom, executive chairman of the Company, added, “Tokenizing gold is the future of commodity finance. Streamex’s regulated approach and public market presence make it a pioneer in this transformative space, with the potential to redefine how investors access real assets.” The FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer, with a presence in the US, will provide Streamex with the regulatory framework to issue and trade tokenized assets under federal securities laws. Compliance Exchange Group (CXG), a leader in broker-dealer compliance, will oversee the acquisition to ensure seamless integration and adherence to regulations. This acquisition is a critical step toward scaling Streamex’s RWA tokenization platform nationwide. Streamex is a gold treasury and infrastructure company building the foundation for on-chain commodity markets. With a focus on RWA tokenization, Streamex is developing a vertically integrated platform that combines token issuance, trading infrastructure and physical gold holdings, positioning the Company to become one of Nasdaq’s largest public holders of gold bullion. This strategic approach aligns with Streamex’s mission to reshape global finance by bringing the approximately $142 trillion global commodities market on chain. By merging the security and trust of physical gold with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain, Streamex is creating scalable financial infrastructure for a new era of digital commodities. The Company plans to hold significant quantities of physical gold, securely vaulted through a top-tier bullion bank. Streamex will denominate the majority of its balance sheet in vaulted gold rather than fiat currency, supporting a long-term, value-based financial model. Combined with Streamex’s Solana-based blockchain infrastructure, this strategy enables a recurring revenue model that supports the issuance of gold-backed digital assets. Streamex is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioSig Technologies, Inc. CXG specializes in building, managing and supporting broker-dealer infrastructure, offering full-service compliance, registration, principal outsourcing and advisory services. BioSig Technologies, Inc. is a medical device technology company with an advanced digital signal processing technology platform, the PURE EP Platform, that delivers insights to electrophysiologists for ablation treatments of cardiovascular arrhythmias. The PURE EP Platform enables electrophysiologists to acquire raw signal data in real-time – absent unnecessary noise or interference – to maximize procedural success and minimize unnecessary inefficiencies.

Title: Most Companies Pick Layoffs. Here’s Why They’re Wrong.

ByRoberta Matuson ByRoberta Matuson, Contributor. The long-term impact of company-wide layoffs Major companies are picking layoffs in the name of efficiency—but is it really making them better? Another day, another layoff announcement. Layoffs are surging across industries, with firms like JPMorgan Chase, Procter & Gamble, and Amazon making headlines for workforce reductions. Just last month, Microsoft announced plans to cut thousands more employees. Corporate America believes a leaner workforce equals quicker growth, but what are the real consequences? When the economy is in flux, companies tend to take the standard approach of slashing headcount, automating roles, and consolidating team. They do this to achieve immediate cost savings, streamlined operations, and to satisfy their investors. This approach may look good on paper, but is this method effective in the long run? No doubt, a massive layoff can result in dollars being added to the bottom line, but at what cost? Loss of Institutional Knowledge and Expertise: Remember how long it took you to bring new hires up to speed and to train them on your systems? The money and time spent will be gone the moment the laid off employee walks out the door, as will the knowledge. This can severely disrupt operations and hinder innovation. Increased Employee Burnout and Decreased Engagement: Workers are already showing signs of employee burnout. Can you afford to ask your people to do more with less resources? Lower morale leads to reduced engagement, which may very well result in higher voluntary turnover—especially among top performers. Decline in Customer Satisfaction and Damage to Your Brand: Reducing headcount can result in slower service, lower quality, more errors, diminished customer trust, ultimately harming the company’s reputation and bottom line. Is your company brand strong enough to survive dips in quality and unflattering social media posts? Legal and Financial Risks: Layoffs can expose companies to legal challenges, such as wrongful termination claims, and may result in significant severance packages being paid out, along with unexpected legal costs. Do you have enough money in your coffers to budget for this? There are better ways than a layoff to boost efficiency. Here are some effective strategies worth further consideration. Focus on Skills, Not Just Headcount: Examine the skills your staff currently has and redeploy talent rather than cut jobs. Let Non-Performers Go: Terminate them, rather than covering this move up by using a layoff to rid your organization of dead weight. Invest in People: Help them reskill and upskill so they can be more productive for your organization. Offer Flexible Work Arrangements: Some workers may jump at the chance to work a reduced workweek or to job share. Offer Voluntary Buyouts and Early Retirement. Provide incentives for employees to leave voluntarily. Reducing headcount this way will be more favorably perceived by remaining staff than a layoff. Develop New Income Streams: It’s said that necessity is the mother of invention. Look for new opportunities to expand your revenues. Although it may be tempting to follow the latest trend of company-wide layoffs, think twice before taking your next step. By proactively implementing these strategies, organizations can navigate through economic upheaval with minimal disruption to their workforce and emerge stronger for the future.

Title: Crypto Market Outlook: How Crypto Will Come of Age in 2025

2024 was a significant year for cryptocurrency markets, both in terms of growth, user adoption, investment, and technological progress. However, progress made in 2024 could seem minor compared to the possible changes ahead in 2025. Recent political changes in the United States point to the start of regulatory clarity. 2025 could be the year the crypto space, active since Bitcoin’s 2009 launch, finally comes into its own. This “clarity” could be a key step to completing crypto’s move from the financial fringes to the mainstream. From there, expect institutional adoption, already surging, to further accelerate. While nothing is certain, all of these factors point to another promising outcome for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, a possible move higher, as this asset class comes of age, bringing stronger market support. Over the past few years, the US cryptocurrency space has been operating with a high level of regulatory uncertainty. Crypto companies operating within the US contended with not just a lack of a regulatory framework, but aggressive enforcement actions from US securities regulators as well. Fortunately, this major headwind is soon coming to an end. On Jan. 20, the new Trump administration took office, promising major changes to US cryptocurrency policy. Based on statements made by the President, there is a strong likelihood that, perhaps within the first 100 days of his administration, the US federal government will commence implementing policy changes that promote the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Binance CEO Richard Teng shares what he expects in the crypto industry in 2025: “Crypto regulation developments are expected from the new US government in 2025, which will encourage more crypto participation across the market, especially from US-based TradFi, and will help inform crypto legislation for other countries across the world.” Teng continued his comments, “There is also the potential of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the US, which could be a significant development and lead to many other countries doing the same. In this scenario, Bitcoin could one day grow to new heights in terms of adoption.” Included in these policy changes will likely be the implementation of a comprehensive regulatory framework. This will bring forth an era of regulatory clarity for US cryptocurrency companies. As this takes shape at the same time other major justifications establish regulatory frameworks of their own, expect this to be a game changer. Mostly, because this regulatory clarity stands to cement crypto’s status as a major asset class. In turn, count on this having a tremendous impact on the allocation of institutional capital into Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, as well as into cryptocurrency investment products. Over the past year, the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) has resulted in massive inflows of institutional and retail investor capital into this space, to the tune of $44.2 billion. However, once comprehensive regulations are implemented, and US regulators go from an aggressive, sceptical stance to one supportive of industry growth, last year’s inflows could prove to be a drop in the bucket compared to future inflows of capital, especially from institutional investors. With major firms like Blackrock now recommending portfolio allocations of up to 2% into Bitcoin, in 2025 and beyond, it’s possible that institutional investors, ranging from state pension funds to sovereign wealth funds and university endowments, begin committing far greater amounts of capital, both directly into cryptocurrencies, as well as into ETPs like spot Bitcoin ETFs. Alongside investment into crypto itself, this asset class’ “coming of age” could also lead to increased venture capital investment into blockchain-based startups. According to recent data from the DeFi Report, blockchain-based startups obtained $13.6 billion in venture capital funding last year, a figure that this year could rise to as much as $18 billion. Considering the supportive conditions expected for crypto investment and adoption, it’s clear that there has been justification for the ramp-up in bullishness for Bitcoin and other cryptos over the past few months. Of course, nothing’s for certain. For instance, recently announced Federal Reserve policy changes have negatively impacted the short-term performance of most heavyweight cryptocurrencies. Further adjustments to Fed policy may have a similar impact. Still, given the potential for regulatory changes and other factors to finally trigger a “coming of age” moment for cryptocurrencies, this milestone may be significant enough to counter other concerns, resulting in further price appreciation for Bitcoin, major altcoins, and even help sustain recent high enthusiasm for speculative cryptos such as Meme coins.

Title: Meta trial becomes test of board culpability over corporate scandals
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/07/14/meta-trial-becomes-test-of-board-culpability-over-corporate-scandals/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T11:32:36Z
Full Content:
Meta luminaries will publicly testify in a Delaware corporate law court this week over shareholder allegations that board mismanagement was directly responsible for billions in sanctions that the social media group paid over data breaches. Two of Facebook parent company’s best known executives, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, are listed as witnesses in the eight-day trial, which starts on Wednesday. Long-time director and investor Marc Andreessen, as well as former board members Jeff Zients, a former top adviser to former US president Joe Biden, are also set to appear. Other director defendants include the investor Peter Thiel, Kenneth Chenault, the former American Express chief executive and Reed Hastings, the Netflix co-founder. The lawsuit, brought by three tiny minority Meta shareholders, is the first time a complaint over a board’s culpability for a corporate scandal has reached a trial in Delaware, where most such lawsuits are quickly dismissed. In a handful of instances, companies have settled litigation over board oversight charges, most notably the directors of Boeing who agreed to pay $237.5 million (€203 million) over shareholder charges that the highest levels at the aviation titan failed to prevent the 737 Max scandal. In the lawsuit, the shareholders accuse Meta’s directors of knowingly overseeing lax privacy practices, in violation of a 2012 consent decree struck with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) designed to protect users’ personal information – claims that the defendants reject. The FTC later launched an investigation into Facebook’s parent triggered in particular by the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which user data was leaked to a political research group through a third-party app. The suing shareholders have asked for damages stemming from the $5 billion settlement struck with the FTC in 2019 following the investigation. According to the plaintiffs, the board “protected” Zuckerberg by approving the price tag without any internal investigation, in return for the FTC agreeing to drop his name as an individual defendant in the case. Plaintiffs also allege that the founder “unlawfully sold billions of dollars of Meta stock because of the material non-public information (“MNPI”) he had regarding the company’s illicit, undisclosed data sharing practices”. [ Meta wins AI copyright case in blow to authorsOpens in new window ] Meta declined to comment on the case. In court filings, the defendants argue that the social media company’s directors did not knowingly violate the 2012 consent order, and that the board’s decision-making was prudent and not conflicted. Meta faces continued regulatory and legal scrutiny over issues including privacy and antitrust. Critics have argued that its aggressive hunt for growth and profits as a younger company led to online harms, with the company accused of amplifying hate speech and misinformation to juice engagement, or having poor data management practices. More recently, it has poured billions of dollars into trying to become a leader in artificial intelligence. “The allegations are significant in terms of who knew what and when during their largest scandal that they’ve had as a company,” said Jason Kint, a Big Tech critic who leads the Digital Content Next trade group of online publishers. “What’s at stake is the trust of the company – not just for the users but for the shareholders.” Shareholder lawsuits alleging poor board oversight have become known as “Caremark” claims, named for the healthcare company whose shareholders alleged corporate law liability over criminal fraud charges in the 1990s at the healthcare company. [ Meta introduces advertising to WhatsApp in push for new revenuesOpens in new window ] Scholars and judges have long been sceptical that wrongdoing stemming from business operations far removed from the boardroom could be pinned on the offending company’s directors. Directors can also offer a defence that pushing the boundaries of the law is consistent with maximising shareholder value. In the case of Meta, its market capitalisation has soared to nearly $2tn. “Increasingly there is a view that other regulators are not robustly doing their job and only corporate law and securities law can bail out victims,” said Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado. Meta notes in its court briefs that Delaware judges have previously remarked that a Caremark claim “is possibly the most difficult theory upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment” and that Meta’s “evidence will show that Facebook implemented a robust system of privacy controls” after the 2012 FTC consent decree. [ European Union risks becoming the ‘museum of the world’, says Meta privacy chiefOpens in new window ] The company has, however, already faced setbacks. The core Caremark claim from the plaintiffs has already survived Meta’s motion to dismiss. Separately, the court earlier this year granted sanctions against Sandberg, who left her executive role in 2022 and the Meta board in 2024, for deleting email messages from her Gmail account after being put on notice about the lawsuit. Last week, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz said it would move its incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, citing “recent actions by the [Delaware] Court of Chancery, which have injected an unprecedented level of subjectivity into judicial decisions, undermining the court’s reputation for unbiased expertise”. The Financial Times has previously reported that Meta has pondered moving its incorporation out of Delaware, the state that has traditionally dominated incorporations by both public and private companies. Technology companies have been spooked by the 2024 decision by Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick to rescind a $55 billion pay deal that Tesla had previously struck with its chief executive, Elon Musk. That case will soon be heard on appeal by the Delaware Supreme Court. Chancellor McCormick is the judge who will now oversee the Facebook trial. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: From Bitcoin to XRP: Key cryptocurrency terms and what they mean
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5w2k5k5ylo
Time Published: 2025-07-14T11:27:58Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin's price reaching a new high of $120,000 (£89,000) - buoyed by US President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance - has kept the buzzy world of cryptocurrencies in the spotlight. But it also contains confusing terms such as ETFs, blockchains and cold wallets, that can make the topic somewhat tricky to navigate. Worry not. If you're hearing these for the first time, or simply need a refresher, here are a few key terms and what they mean. While many may struggle with the finer points of crypto, pretty much everyone has heard of its most famous product: Bitcoin. But what actually is it? Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is to say a type of digital currency. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by centralised financial institutions. This makes it popular for people who think decentralisation can bring financial freedom, but it also makes it extremely volatile with it rising and falling in value at the whim of Bitcoin buyers and sellers. Donald Trump has pledged to make the US the "crypto capital of the world" - backtracking on his previous claim that Bitcoin was a "scam". Its price topped a much-awaited threshold of $100,000 in December 2024. In mid-July 2025, the price rose to $120,000 as US politicians prepared to begin debating bills that would regulate digital assets. But its price has been known to plummet just as quickly as it spikes. Blockchain is the technology underpinning all cryptocurrencies, and many related products like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In essence, it is a virtual spreadsheet on which all the buying and selling of crypto is recorded. They are arranged in blocks linked together in a giant chain - hence the name. Every cryptocurrency transaction is individually recorded onto the blockchain by a huge network of volunteers verifying its authenticity by using computer programmes. The incentive to do this for Bitcoin's network is that the first person to validate transactions is rewarded in Bitcoin. This potentially lucrative process, known as mining, is also controversial because of the incredible amount of energy used as people the world over race to be the first to successfully update the blockchain. The blockchain is sustained by rewarding so-called "miners" - whose job it is to validate transactions - by paying them with the cryptocurrency. However, unlike some other digital currencies, there is not an infinite supply of Bitcoins. The amount that can be mined is capped at 21 million, and most are already in circulation. So roughly every four years - or when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain size - the number of bitcoins rewarded to those who successfully validate transactions is cut in half. The most recent Bitcoin "halving" (or "halvening") event took place on 20 April 2024, reducing the reward for miners from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125. This ensures Bitcoin's supply is drawn out for longer while demand, in theory, goes up over time. But with fewer rewards for miners, it can also lead some to consider whether it is financially worthwhile for them to continue the costly operation of running their powerful computers. A crypto exchange is the digital platform where investors can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Similar to traditional investing, a crypto exchange acts as a brokerage where people can transfer traditional money, like pounds or dollars, in exchange for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most transactions are accompanied by fees. A crypto wallet is a place where investors hold their cryptocurrency. There are two types, a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, and thus more accessible for quick transfers and easy access. Cold wallets are physical devices like specially designed USB sticks that store crypto offline typically for safer and longer term storage. Ethereum is used to describe both the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, represented by the Ether token, and the blockchain underpinning it. This supports an array of different applications and digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens. It functions in a similar way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in 2022 switched to a greener operating system requiring less computers and energy. ETFs are portfolios that let investors bet on multiple assets without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. They can comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mix of shares in both technology and insurance companies. A spot Bitcoin ETF buys the cryptocurrency directly, "on the spot", at its current price, throughout the day. While some ETFs already contained Bitcoin indirectly, the US approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. This allowed new investors, such as investment management firms like Blackrock and Fidelity, to enter the speculative world of Bitcoin without having to worry about digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges. Meme coins are a form of cryptocurrency used for fun and speculation. They are typically created to capitalise on social media trends or viral memes - such as for internet-famous pygmy hippo Moo Deng. But meme coins are heavily criticised for their speculative nature and the risk involved for investors, as they often have little prospect of accumulating value over time. They can also be susceptible to "rug pulls" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers to raise the price of their coin, only to stop trading activity and make off with the money raised from sales. Some celebrities have faced backlash after launching meme coins. "Stable" is the key word here - this cryptocurrency differs from others as it is intends to be less volatile in value. This typically works by the price being linked to an existing asset, for instance currencies like the US dollar or pound sterling, which in theory should make them more stable in price than cryptocurrencies that are not backed by assets. Stablecoins themselves are usually controlled by companies that provide them, with transactions recorded on digital ledgers. While held up by some as the future of finance, high profile price collapses of stablecoins have alerted regulators to risks for investors and prompted scrutiny over their supposed stability. XRP is a cryptocurrency used by a platform called the XRP Ledger. It was created by the co-founders of financial services company Ripple Labs in 2012 as a cheaper, faster alternative to Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has a fixed supply of 100 billion coins, which were created when it launched. Much of it is held by Ripple and periodically released into circulation. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, transactions made using XRP are verified through consensus - whereby the majority of validators on its peer-to-peer network must agree whether or not a transaction is valid before it is added to its blockchain. This has been credited with allowing many transactions to take place simultaneously, at high speed and low cost - making it appealing to financial institutions or for processes like cross-border payments. But as with other cryptocurrencies, XRP has received regulatory scrutiny and seen sudden, sharp declines in value.

Title: The Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X prices may have leaked — and if true, it's not as bad as I thought
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-ally-and-xbox-ally-x-prices-may-have-leaked
Time Published: 2025-07-14T11:00:48Z
Full Content:
Microsoft and ASUS are gearing up to launch the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld later this year, and the biggest questions remain fixed on price. Do we have our first answer? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A few weeks ago, we exclusively leaked the Xbox Ally, codenamed Kennan, in development with ASUS ROG. The Xbox Ally range is powered by Z2 APUs, including the first handheld that will sport the Z2 Extreme on the high-end. These devices will have a heavily customized Windows 11 experience, complete with the first iterations of boot-to-full-screen-app capabilities. The new Xbox app will handle multi-tasking and other system features with an interface more intuitive for controller use, while also likely being the most powerful gaming handheld in existence. Given that last fact, people are expecting the Xbox Ally to also have a powerful price tag. There have already been some rumors about its price range flying around, from anywhere between $800 to over $1000 dollars. A new report from 3DJuegos (via IG) may have given us the first glance, leaked by ASUS itself. And honestly, it's not as bad as I was expecting. Although these prices may still just be place holders or some weird quirk of Google's new AI-"enhanced" search algorithms, Google Search store meta data scraped from ASUS' website, seemingly, suggests that the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X will closely match their predecessor's retail price, at least in Europe. For comparison, the previous Z1 Extreme ASUS ROG Ally X is currently also €899 in Europe at RRP, although it's currently on sale for $100 off on Amazon Germany. ASUS and other hardware retailers rarely do 1:1 price conversions on devices like this. At the current exchange rate, an €899 euro ASUS ROG Ally X would come in at $1050 US if that were the case. Instead, the ASUS ROG Ally X typically sports a $799 RRP in the United States, although some US retailers like Best Buy have it at $899 right now, likely due to stock limitations. Indeed, purchasing power, VAT, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and other factors go towards deciding the finalized price. Flat currency conversions are not how prices are decided, so take analyses making such claims with a huge pinch of salt. Given the constant evolution of the tariff situations emanating from the United States, you can bet that ASUS and Microsoft could wait until the last minute to finalize the price point. There is an event on the horizon that Microsoft typically prioritizes its PC announcements at, though, in the form of Gamescom in Germany, so it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility for a formal announcement there. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Z1 Extreme regular ASUS ROG Ally is on sale for $649 in the United States, which is where these "leaked" prices potentially get a bit more interesting. The regular ASUS ROG Ally (Z1 Extreme) is available to buy at around €699 in Europe and $649-ish in the United States, which would put the base model Xbox Ally around €100 cheaper than its higher-end predecessor. This could be a reflection of the power disparity. The lower-end ASUS ROG Ally is listed as $499 on ASUS' website, for reference. The Z2 "A" chip in the base model Xbox Ally is thought to not be as powerful as the Z1 Extreme in the previous ASUS ROG Ally on paper. It's specifically designed to be more cost-effective and potentially more battery efficient. The Xbox Ally X Z2 Extreme will be the crown jewel of gaming handhelds, though, and the price point will reflect that. Model Configuration Price (USD) ASUS ROG Ally (2023) Z1 / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $499 ASUS ROG Ally (2023) Z1E / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $649 ASUS ROG Ally X (2024) Z1E / 24 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD $799 Xbox Ally (2025) Z2A / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $599 (Estimated) Xbox Ally X (2025) Z2E / 24 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD $899 (Estimated) There has been speculation as to whether or not Microsoft would subsidize these devices, since it will be front-loading its Xbox PC store on them. I'd say that, increasingly, the era of subsidized "console" hardware is going to be a thing of the past, as players increasingly flock to PC and third-party software sales continue to be a smaller part of Microsoft's overall business. The Xbox Ally range are going to be Windows 11 gaming PCs in essence, meaning that you could buy one and never spend a penny on Microsoft's gaming ecosystem. It wouldn't make sense for Microsoft to subsidize it from their perspective. Either way, this could be our first real glimpse at the ASUS Xbox Ally price points. I would expect the United States price points to match the sticker price, rather than do a simple currency conversion. As such, I wouldn't be surprised if the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X come in at around $599 and $899 respectively, if these EU leaked prices are indeed accurate. It would closely match our previous predictions on the Xbox Ally price. But we won't know for sure until ASUS and Microsoft reveal it at their end. Better get saving, either way.

Title: Vanguard Expands Fixed-Income Menu with 3 Treasury ETFs
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/investing-strategies-etf/vanguard-expands-fixed-income-menu-with-3-treasury-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T10:10:00Z
Full Content:
The firm has launched nine total fixed-income ETFs this year. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com Apparently, Vanguard is looking to spend some quality bonding time with clients. Last week, the world’s second-largest asset manager launched three government bond ETFs: the Vanguard Government Securities Active ETF (VGVT), the Vanguard Total Treasury ETF (VTG) and the Vanguard Total Inflation-Protected Securities ETF (VTP). That brings the total number of fixed-income ETFs it has launched this year to nine. Vanguard isn’t alone in its efforts. Across the industry, issuers are racing to launch fixed-income products as the market environment becomes more fertile for bonds and Treasurys. “Just about every asset manager is pushing into fixed-income,” said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst for Morningstar, adding that fixed-income is a massive trend but isn’t talked about as much as active or options-based income strategies. Fixed-income products have been a priority for the firm since Tim Buckley’s tenure as CEO, but up until recently, the opportunity just wasn’t there for those kinds of ETFs, Sotiroff told Advisor Upside. “It’s hard to sell a product when short-term yields are at near 0% like they were for much of the 2010s,” he said. Today, however, interest rates are hovering near the historical average and equity markets are volatile, creating “a period where fixed-income has reemerged as a valuable diversifier in a balanced portfolio,” according to Sam Martinez, senior fixed-income product manager at Vanguard. The firm’s latest fixed-income ETFs include one actively managed product and two index funds: “Client value is our motivation for building out our fixed-income lineup,” Martinez said, adding that nine funds Vanguard has launched this year have garnered more than $2 billion in assets. And They’re Off! Asset managers have launched nearly 80 fixed-income ETFs this year alone. While the list of issuers includes industry giants like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, it also features smaller names like Stone Ridge Asset Management, Bluemonte and Cohen & Steers. “Everybody’s been throwing their hat into the ring,” Sotiroff said. Trump’s media company has filed for a third crypto-focused ETF that would hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Cronos and XRP. The agency’s new guidelines focus on disclosures around price fluctuations and market manipulation, among other common concerns. The fund pulled in more than $18 million in assets over two days last week but has seen negligible interest from investors long term. The fund marks the latest example of issuers capitalizing on growing investor appetite for lower-risk options. The firm has increasingly brought its nontraditional style of active management to Dimensional ETFs, which has ramped up sales. Innovator’s new ETF takes its structure from the world of annuities, but its utility to investors remains an open question. Numerous products have been awaiting approval by the SEC, and more, such as an index-based crypto ETF, are in development. Rich investors with large stock portfolios and capital gains get a tax bonus with 351 ETF exchanges. The fund enters into swap agreements with J.P. Morgan and tracks an index from MerQube. The buy now, pay later business has a stigma that could hold back a proposed ETF focused on the market, one observer noted. Assets under management in defined outcome ETFs are expected to top $650 billion by 2030, according to BlackRock data. Asset managers said active strategies are among their top choices for new products, per Morningstar. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Tariff Fallout Hasn’t Hit Markets Yet. Issuers Say That Could Change

Strategists from Allianz and Invesco are cautioning investors about market performance in the second half of the year. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com As if we needed more tariff turmoil. Strategists from some of the world’s top asset managers are now cautioning investors about a possible market slowdown in the second half of 2025 as the effects of President Trump’s tariff policy spread through the broader economy. Experts from Vanguard, BlackRock, Allianz and Invesco are keeping a close eye on growth as the added costs from levies on foreign goods drive up prices in the US. While timing the markets is anyone’s guess, the potential of higher inflation could push investors into derivative-based products, like buffered ETFs, to hedge against a market dip, according to Charlie Ripley, vice president of portfolio management at Allianz. “The impact from tariffs will be a meaningful pickup of inflation that has yet to show up in the hard data sets,” he said. “Our perspective on the direction of travel for equity markets, first and foremost, includes a wider range of outcomes.” Inflation is one thing, but it’s not the only issue keeping economists up at night. Trump’s recently passed tax and spending bill should have a marginally positive impact on the economy as Americans consume more over the next few years, Ripley said. “On the other hand, the increase in spending is going to have to be funded somehow and despite the run-up in rates we have already seen, the supply and demand picture for long-dated Treasurys could keep upward pressure on yields,” he told ETF Upside. If tariffs do drive up inflation, the Fed will have its hands tied on any further interest rate cuts. Finding a consensus among a divided Fed could also prove difficult as long as inflation is looming, Ripley added. The good news: “We recognize that things could change quickly with the current administration with global trade and geopolitics remaining as top risks,” Ripley said. Let’s All Play Nice. There are other key global trends that could loom large over the second half, too, including restrictive immigration policies here at home and investments moving into the defense sector in Europe, said Brian Levitt, a global market strategist at Invesco. “These dynamics suggest a more inflationary environment and moderated growth outlook for the US in 2025, relative to earlier expectations,” Levitt said in a recent outlook, adding that global markets may also wane. However, a “constructive resolution of trade tensions” could sustain markets through the end of the year. Here’s to hoping. Sports betting and gambling have taken off in recent years, but their ETFs’ success remains relatively market-dependent. Assets under management in defined outcome ETFs are expected to top $650 billion by 2030, according to BlackRock data. The firm, which offers six digital assets ETFs, announced a new global product leadership team earlier this year. Invesco recently added several active ETFs to its product lineup, and PGIM is among those prepping a few more. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: You Have No Idea How Furious the Canadians Are

Time Published: 2025-07-14T09:00:21Z
Full Content:
This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. In May, I reoriented my algorithms to flood me with Canadian content, turned on push notifications from The Globe and Mail, and temporarily moved my family north of the border. For months, Donald Trump had been casually threatening to annex Canada and turn it into a state, adding insult to the injury of the trade war he was waging on the country. One prime minister resigned amid Trump’s bullying, and another was elected because voters thought he could stand up to him. In the ordinarily placid provinces, feelings of bewilderment, anxiety, and offense hardened into a defiant resolve against the United States. “Elbows up,” went the nation’s new hockey-inspired mantra. As a Montreal journalist told me, Americans were preoccupied with “12 different crises.” In Canada, this was the crisis. Anti-American resistance was visible as soon as I landed. At a news kiosk at Toronto Pearson International Airport, the cover of Maclean’s, the de facto national magazine, teased “20 Reasons to Eat Canadian.” Inside was a letter from the editor about canceling a vacation to Cape Cod. This was mild compared with the cover of its next issue, “The New Nationalism,” which contained articles about “Why Canada Will Never Be an American State,” “How to Fight Back Against Trump’s Tariffs,” and “Fear and Loathing in a Canadian Border Town.” The publication had a new promotional campaign: “Canada’s Not for Sale. (But Maclean’s is.)” In grocery stores, Canada-affiliated products had been demarcated with red maple-leaf insignia — an official act of solidarity that complemented the consumer practice of flipping U.S. products upside down to make them easier to avoid. At a Loblaws, a woman wearing a leather jacket and AirPods was inspecting a jar of pomegranate marmalade to verify its country of origin. “I’m so disgusted by what’s going on down there. The most recent Harvard thing?” she said. “I shop on Amazon all the time — I recognize it’s an American company — I switched from buying stuff made in America to buying stuff made in China. And you know what? I’m okay with it.” She suggested I download an app called Maple Scan, which would tell me how Canadian a product was when I took a picture of it. (Canada Dry ginger ale, I learned, is owned by the American conglomerate Keurig Dr Pepper.) The app is just one of a crush of new tools that people up North are using to scrutinize the Canadianness of their purchases. Another one called TheCanadaList.ca was founded by a forensic-psychology professor at Ontario Tech University. He broke down his new habits in a newspaper interview: “I’ve switched from Oreos to Dare or Leclerc, from Nature Valley to MadeGood, from Lay’s to Hardbite, from Oikos to Liberté, from Tostitos to Mad Mexican.” The Buy Canadian phenomenon was even more pronounced on the alcohol front, as the country’s liquor stores are mostly government-run. Ontario Premier Doug Ford — brother of the late Rob Ford, the scandal-plagued Toronto mayor — halted the sale of American products by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, inspiring the other provinces to do the same. I drove to a Toronto LCBO to experience a liquor store with zero bottles of Tito’s Handmade vodka or Josh Cellars Merlot. Taped to the entrance were signs in French and English announcing the removal of U.S. products FOR THE GOOD OF CANADA. I was handed, and asked not to misplace, a laminated list of Canadian alternatives to popular American products. A clerk told me the U.S. booze was in the cellar aging indefinitely. Caught in the crossfire are blameless Canadian products that have an American stigma. For example: White Claw hard seltzer. “White Claw is a Canadian company that made itself huge down South,” Tyler VanderWallen, the general manager of Toronto’s Grizzly Bar, told me (“down South” is the U.S.). “If I sold White Claw here, I’d have to explain that to every third person, and I don’t want to have that fight.” Grizzly Bar is located on Toronto’s nightlife-heavy Queen Street West. A 14-foot inflatable moose guards its front door, and patrons are greeted by a motion-sensor-activated snippet of “O Canada” when they walk through it. The cocktails have names only Canadians understand, like “TVO Kids” and “Hadfield.” Everywhere, there is knowing Canadian kitsch: Canadian-side Niagara Falls projected onto a wall; a Wall of Heroes featuring framed photos of Ryan Reynolds, Leonard Cohen, Shania Twain, Margaret Atwood, Alex Trebek, and 46 others; a map of the key battles of the War of 1812. The bar is owned by a Vancouver video-game designer and his wife, who like to change its theme regularly, “like a piece of code.” When Trump ramped up his attacks, switching to a rabidly pro-Canada décor was the obvious move. The establishment was now under extra pressure to present a wholly Canadian front, from food ingredients to playlists. VanderWallen has started sourcing limes from Mexico instead of the U.S., even though they cost him around 20 cents more apiece. He said he still buys Heinz ketchup “because there’s a Heinz branch in Canada that is promising me I am getting 95 percent Canadian tomatoes.” Other establishments became anti-American against their will. When I visited Badlands, a Toronto bourbon bar that opened three months before all the bourbon disappeared, the manager, Carolina Rodriguez, pointed to a shelf of whiskey bottles she hadn’t intended to stock: Crown Royal (Canadian), Johnnie Walker (Scottish), and Bushmills (Irish). Deprived of the authentic U.S. product, Badlands rebranded as an all-purpose “country” bar. “My favorite cocktail is a Paper Plane, and if you have to make it without bourbon, it is terrible,” Rodriguez confessed to me. When she feels a customer deserves it, she’ll pull from her dwindling stash of pre-Prohibition Jim Beam and make them a proper drink without revealing its key ingredient. The country’s political class has attempted to sever itself from the U.S. by reorienting the Canadian economy in an east-west rather than north-south direction. For example, Canada is knocking down interprovincial trade barriers that make it near impossible to order a bottle of gin from Winnipeg if you live across the country, in say, Halifax. But on an individual level, the most evident rupture has occurred with respect to travel. Southbound commerce and tourism, even to once-symbiotic border destinations, has fallen off a cliff. Horror stories circulating about aggressive U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents don’t help. Buffalo’s new “Buffalo Loves Canada” campaign is trying to entice Canadian visitors by raffling off a $500 gift certificate and by emphasizing its appreciation of Canadian brands. (“Looking at you, Tim Hortons, Swiss Chalet, and Labatt Blue!”) The director of New York’s Thousand Islands tourism bureau stopped showing American images to Canadians on social media “because that allowed for some of that negative sentiment to fester.” The unfavorable exchange rate had already dampened Canadian enthusiasm for the U.S. before Trump smothered it entirely, said Caroline Beteta, the half-Canadian president and CEO of Visit California, the state’s tourism agency. But now warm-weather American states were desperately trying to lure staycationing “snowbirds” back to the sunny regions that rely on their seasonal commerce. “The Canadian media didn’t really want to entertain interviews with us,” Beteta said. She and her team put together an ad spot to highlight connections between the two peoples: the California roll, invented by a chef from British Columbia; Napa’s Signorello Estate, owned by a Canadian. YouTube commenters found it unpersuasive. The snowbird deficit was especially pronounced in Florida, with travelers flocking to the Caribbean instead and Canadian airlines axing direct flights. Governor Ron DeSantis didn’t seem too worried about the 3.3 million Canadians who visited in 2024 not returning, though others in Florida were frantic. “We don’t have any emails; we don’t have any calls,” said Karine Martinez, the Miami-based executive director of the CanadaFlorida Chamber of Commerce. These kinds of casualties are all over the place: In May, Canada’s passport office announced it was cutting 800 jobs because of decreased demand for applications. I spoke to snowbirds who are not just boycotting the beach but have sold second homes. One tech investor who built a house north of Palm Beach a few years ago told me his American golf buddies started making 51st-state jokes: “The first time, it’s funny. The second time, okay. The third time, it’s becoming annoying.” The last straw was a guy in a pickup truck who saw his plates in a parking lot and told him to go back to Canada. This is no way to live, he recalled thinking. Dale Hajas, a retiree from Ontario, recently kissed good-bye to her Greater Tampa development, where she estimates one-fifth of the winter residents are Canadian. “I’ve written to every tourism outlet in the United States — and not very graciously, I swear — to tell them why I will never set foot” there again, she said. “I redacted and then sent out-of-date bank statements showing what we’ve spent in the U.S. over the years.” Edmundston, New Brunswick, sits directly across the border from Madawaska, Maine. Both communities are bilingual, and until this year, their historically Acadian roots bound them more to each other than to their respective nations. Now, Edmundston’s mayor, Eric Marquis, told me border tensions have ruined everything. Residents say they will never return to the U.S., even though everybody has family on both sides and Edmundstoners used to cross over all the time for cheaper gas. “We had to procure two new fire trucks this year,” Marquis said, and this time, they had to be Canadian made. “The first question posed by the city council was ‘Where do they come from?’” The rupture began in earnest last fall. After decades of ho-hum amity that had survived the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement in his first term, Trump began to covetously talk about the “faucet” of Canadian river water he wished to divert to California. After the election, then–Prime Minister Justin Trudeau traveled to Mar-a-Lago to try to calm Trump’s early trade-related belligerence. The visit backfired when Trump mused about annexation over dinner, then started referring to Trudeau as a mere “governor” on Truth Social. Deeply unpopular even before Trump started messing with him, Trudeau announced his resignation in January. Trump proceeded to air grievances about Canada’s stingy military spending and dairy-production quotas while calling into question the boundaries governing control of the Great Lakes and the 1908 treaty that established the 49th parallel as the border. The administration then applied a round of tariffs to Canada, allegedly to punish it for the fentanyl slipping in from the north. (From 2022 to 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 59 pounds of fentanyl from Canada, compared with 61,900 pounds from Mexico.) Trump’s top brass took up the cause too. FBI director Kash Patel declared on Fox News that 85 percent of “known or suspected” terrorists who entered the country last year came via Canada. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited a library that straddles the border, hopping from Quebec to Vermont while chanting “51st state!” Through the early months of the year, the administration continued to threaten, delay, and apply more tariffs while others were struck down in court. Canada is now chiefly being hit with 50 percent duties on steel and aluminum and 25 percent on automobiles, categories from which it had theoretically won exemptions when it signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2018, a pact Trump called “the best trade deal ever made.” In April, Canada experienced a record trade deficit, driven by a double-digit decline in automobile exports. That month, the central banker and political novice Mark Carney led the underdog Liberals to an upset national victory, which the party owed to the electorate’s view that the once-favored Conservative Party could not credibly stand up to Trump. “Trump is trying to break us so he can own us,” Carney had argued on the campaign trail. Even if most Canadians didn’t deem it likely that Trump would literally invade, there was agreement that he was, for some reason, fixated on crippling them. Carney has since applied counter-tariffs on some $30 billion of U.S. goods, targeting red-state-manufactured products such as bowling balls and bullets. There is only so much pain a country nine times less populous than the United States can inflict, but Canada’s boycotts have started to have their intended effect. Not long after the alcohol ban was imposed, a Kentucky distiller reported he’d already lost $115,000 from canceled shipments to Canada. Every week brings new statistics documenting Canadian retrenchment. Car trips to the U.S.: down 38 percent. Flights: down 24 percent. Canadian web traffic to the home-listings site Redfin: down 26 percent. Thirty-four U.S. states count Canada as their largest export market. “Give us another chance,” said North Dakota Republican Kevin Cramer, when a delegation of U.S. senators visited Ottawa to try and mend relations. In early May, Carney and Trump held a predictably surreal press conference in the Oval Office. Trump began genially, congratulating Carney on his election: “It was probably one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics, maybe even greater than mine.” But when a reporter asked if he still envisioned Canada as the 51st state, Trump killed the goodwill. “You know, I’m a real-estate developer at heart,” he said. The president waxed poetic about erasing “that artificially drawn line” on the map between the U.S. and Canada, saying that “when you look at that beautiful formation, when it’s together — I’m a very artistic person — but when I looked at that beauty, I said, ‘That’s the way it was meant to be.’” Carney interjected coolly, “Well, if I may, as you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale. We’re sitting in one right now.” Trump’s attacks galvanized Canadians because they had thought of their relationship with the U.S. as fraternal; the two countries share a language, cultural idioms, an undefended 5,525-mile border. When the Canadian journalist Paul Wells reluctantly severed his ties with the States this year, he wrote that it felt like an “amputation.” Yet the result of Canada’s withdrawal has been not just a mass “freedom fries” moment but a quest to redefine a national ethos distinct from American influence. Ten years ago, Trudeau told the New York Times his country had “no core identity” and had proudly set aside its cultural divisions to become “the first post-national state.” Now, Trump has given Trudeau’s own listless party an opening to reclaim a sense of patriotism, making Conservative pols feel like the victims of a stolen-valor campaign but uniting most everyone else around an invigorating shared project. When Scarborough, Ontario, native Mike Myers brandished a CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE T-shirt and mouthed “Elbows up” on Saturday Night Live — the phrase is associated with Red Wings legend Gordie Howe — he gave a name to the movement sweeping the country. In an ad spot for his bid for prime minister, Carney grilled Myers, a U.S. resident, to make sure he had retained his Canadian in-knowledge. (Carney: “What are the two seasons in Toronto?” Myers: “Winter and construction.”) Celebrity affiliation cuts the other way, too. In June, Jagmeet Singh, the former leader of the progressive New Democratic Party, was spotted attending a Kendrick Lamar concert, which was arguably disloyal to Lamar’s rival, Drake, even in peacetime. The Toronto rapper called him out, and Singh groveled for forgiveness, claiming he had been there only to see the other headliner, SZA. Also, wine from the estate that produces Wayne Gretzky’s line has become an exception to the Buy Canadian rule. Once a national hero, Gretzky is now persona non grata for his friendship with Trump. A guy offering tastings at a kiosk told me he places Gretzky’s wine as far from the customer eyeline as possible. One of the surest signs of the national mood shift is that even in Quebec, the independence-minded, Anglo-skeptical electorate is reporting unprecedented surges of Canadian patriotism. The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Yves-François Blanchet, has dismissed the rest of Canada as “an artificial country.” Yet many Québécois have swung toward the Liberals as a bulwark against Trump, and Blanchet understands the need to ally with them too. “This truce will last as long as we face the challenge imposed by Trump,” he told Maclean’s. Even the most anti-Canada Canadians I met couldn’t work themselves up for annexation. In Ottawa, I met Nicholas Ewanchuk outside the Canadian Parliament; he was flying a Trump flag, an American flag superimposed with an 18-wheeler, and an upside-down Canadian flag — the latter two symbols of the trucker convoy that blockaded Ottawa in 2022 in protest of COVID-19 restrictions. A Saskatchewan trucker fired for noncompliance, Ewanchuk had been protesting in Ottawa ever since. I asked if he was interested in joining the U.S. He winced, parrying the question. “You know, there never used to be a border. Back in the day, it was called Turtle Island,” he said, using an Indigenous term for the North American landmass. Canadian Star Trek legend William Shatner has been publicly workshopping a counterproposal to the U.S., summoning his Captain Kirk persona to engage in freelance diplomacy. “Canadians are very aware of the ka-ra-te adage ‘Use the opponent’s weight against them,’” Shatner told me from Los Angeles. “Canada should say to President Trump, ‘You are the head of a rambunctious country, very difficult to govern at this point. We can ease your pain. Canada is calm, settled, successful. Clean air, clean water, pleasant people. Why don’t you become the 11th province?’” Two days after I arrived in Canada, I caught a plane to Ottawa to get a glimpse of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. Charles had come to the capital to deliver a highly anticipated address to the Canadian Parliament called a “Speech From the Throne,” the climax of a pomp-filled 24-hour visit plotted by the new prime minister as a symbolic rebuke to Trump. In the hours leading up to the speech, I followed the royals to events designed to showcase Canada’s heritage and natural bounty: a puck drop at a youth hockey game, a farmers’ market, a tree planting, a military parade, all of them thronged with people in maple-leaf and Union Jack gear. Rolling out the red carpet for one’s old colonial master may not seem like an obvious demonstration of national sovereignty, but it made sense in Canada: Since Trump has a thing for the royals, it was a flex that the nation, as a member of the Commonwealth, could summon its king on short notice, especially as Charles was undergoing treatments for cancer. Amid Trump’s confusing aggression, the visit would also underscore the country’s secure place in a wider global dominion. And contrary to the idea that the two nations were intuitively mergeable, a choreographed regal affair might accentuate certain proudly un-American aspects of Canada’s national character, such as the “peace, order, and good government” enshrined in its constitution. In the capital, the royal visit was treated as a national holiday. Even its most benign details were curated, or at least interpreted, to reflect the hostile new dynamic between Canada and its longtime ally to the south. On previous visits, for example, Charles had been chauffeured in an American-made Lincoln. This time, he rode in a BMW. A royal historian named Justin Vovk insisted to the CBC that even Charles’s planting of a single tree would “take on added symbolism,” given Trump’s rhetoric about Canada’s natural resources. Waiting for the royals to show up at the farmers’ market, I chatted up well-wishers pressed against a security perimeter. A woman named Lucia Velasco told me she saw Charles as a stabilizing force in wartime. “And right now we are not at war, but …,” she said, trailing off. Debbie Guiry, standing nearby and wearing a Union Jack umbrella hat, finished the thought: “It feels like it.” The night before the “Speech From the Throne,” I met Liam Mooney at the Rideau Club, an elite gathering spot established by two of Canada’s founding fathers. Mooney, who runs an Ottawa branding agency with his wife, created the now-famous CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE cap worn by Premier Ford, which has sold more than 50,000 units and inspired many knockoffs. A little sheepishly, Mooney told me, he has cried at just two celebrity deaths — those of NFL broadcaster John Madden and Queen Elizabeth II. In other words, some part of him could easily have been American, but another was not. In January, after Trudeau announced his resignation, Mooney said, “We had this weird problem where Canada doesn’t have a dad.” Today, he said, half-joking, “Granddad is here.” Over my weeks in Canada, I encountered a number of attempts to retrofit a cohesive identity onto a nation that can seem best defined by its agreeable pastiche of other nations’ influences. “Talking about the Canadian border or the 49th parallel like it’s an imaginary thing — it forces you to think, like, Okay, well, what is it that we’re about?” Mooney said. “Well, Canada’s bilingual. We are a peacekeeping nation. We are a winter nation. When it’s 30 below Celsius, you better have a good relationship with your neighbor” because it’s too cold to head into town for milk. Mooney repeated an adage I heard a lot: The country is a mosaic of peoples, rather than an assimilated, American-style melting pot. “We are a parliamentary democracy,” he said. “We were founded by these two crowns, the British and the French.” A Euro-style social democracy built on a foundation of Tory mildness, Canada can feel lab-designed for compromise and geniality. In The Globe and Mail, a writer described the nation as one of “satirists and folk singers, sage retired bureaucrats, and many, many farmers.” In Maclean’s, another writer compared Canada’s “long but imperfect history of muddling along peaceably” with America’s “unpredictable and increasingly dysfunctional empire.” All of which makes the new Canadian nationalism so striking. Despite Trump’s instigation of the conflict, there is an oddly abstract quality to U.S. bellicosity; even the president’s most loyal supporters may be only vaguely aware that the relationship with the country’s close trading partner and military ally has completely ruptured. Whereas in Canada, where nobody had a problem in the first place, virtually the entire population is now charged up and doing bespoke economic protectionism. “In the U.S., there’s roughly 350 million people going on their way, la-di-da,” said Ford, the Ontario premier. “But there’s 41 million Canadians at a fever pitch right now doing everything they possibly can to support the cause. I’ve never seen patriotism like this.” The “Speech From the Throne” took place at 11 a.m. on a Tuesday. Normally a rote address used to open a new session of Parliament, the actual sovereign had only twice appeared in person to deliver it. And while the speech was written by the prime minister’s staff, even the subtlest anti-Trump jab ventriloquized by the monarch would be newsworthy. The country’s political class showed up in full, including vanquished Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. First Nations leaders from the prairie provinces arrived in traditional headdresses, and Trudeau caused a fuss by wearing turquoise-and-orange Adidas Gazelles with his suit. The king began by acknowledging the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe people, then delivered his speech in French and English, alternating every few paragraphs. “When my dear late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, opened a new Canadian Parliament in 1957, the Second World War remained a fresh, painful memory,” read Charles in his familiar murmur. Sitting beside him was Camilla, wearing a maple-leaf brooch. Now, he continued, “Canada is facing challenges that are unprecedented in our lifetimes.” The king spoke of self-determination and the rule of law and trade, rendering the target of his speech unmistakable. His closing line generated a rousing ovation: “As the anthem reminds us, the True North is indeed strong and free.” If the goal was to get Trump’s attention, it appeared to work. Later that day, he posted on Truth Social, “I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation, but will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State. They are considering the offer!” In my travels, I met a retired high-school history teacher named Peter Kear who loaned me his copy of a 1993 book called The Fight for Canada: Four Centuries of Canadian Resistance to American Expansionism. As an American typically unversed in Canadian history, I wondered if its title was maybe a bit hyperbolic. Then I opened the book to example after footnoted example of zealous American attempts to dominate Canada. “Come then, ye generous Citizens, range yourselves under the Standard of general Liberty,” General George Washington wrote to the Canadians in September 1775, announcing he had authorized a military invasion “not to plunder, but to protect you.” The British Empire had recently conquered Quebec and the rest of New France from Louis XV, and the Americans were trying to enlist the colony in their brewing revolution. Their entreaties failed, in part because of Britain’s shrewd passage of the 1774 Quebec Act, which allowed the province to maintain its Catholic religion. Washington launched a New Year’s Eve invasion of Quebec City that ended in miserable defeat and the capture of 372 of Colonel Benedict Arnold’s 500 troops. America was undeterred. “The unanimous voice of the Continent is that Canada must be ours,” insisted John Adams, then a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress. In the winter of 1776, Benjamin Franklin was sent north on a diplomatic mission to tout the U.S. cause, which also failed. After the Americans won the Revolutionary War, tens of thousands of Tory “United Empire Loyalists” fled to Canada, massively increasing its English-speaking population and arguably seeding the temperamental divide between tranquil Canada and its more ardent neighbor to the south. In 1812, President James Madison declared war and invaded Canada again; Speaker of the House Henry Clay said, “I would take the whole continent from them.” (The war is generally considered a draw, but I was made to understand that British Canada and its Shawnee allies should be seen as the victors because the invading Americans gained no territory while their opponents burned down the White House.) In 1844, James K. Polk won the presidency on the strength of the “54-40 or Fight” campaign to claim northwestern land clear to Alaska, up through present-day British Columbia. From the Canadian perspective, the movement to confederate the country’s provinces into a single nation was driven partly by the need to resist American expansion, which Canadians feared would spread northward after the military buildup of the Civil War. “They coveted Florida, and seized it; they coveted Louisiana, and they purchased it; they coveted Texas, and stole it,” said Thomas D’Arcy McGee, a Father of Confederation who had moved from the U.S. to escape its “diseased love of excitement.” McGee was allegedly murdered by a member of an Irish separatist group that attacked Canada with the possible blessing of President Andrew Johnson. Even after Britain granted Canada the right to self-governance, in 1867, the U.S. continued to wage economic warfare in an attempt to bring the young country to its knees. In 1888, Secretary of State James Blaine wrote that, like a ripe apple, Canada would “fall into our hands” and “seek admission to the Union” if the U.S. bludgeoned it with the heavy import duties that became known as the McKinley -Tariff, named for Trump’s favorite protectionist. (There have also been Canadian pro-annexationists, including the composer of “O Canada,” of all people, who in the 1880s became embittered with his country and moved to Massachusetts.) Relations improved vastly in the 20th century, but even in the 1980s, vestigial anxiety about American imperialism was such that many felt free trade, not protectionism, was the thing that would finally KO Canada’s sovereignty. The 1988 Liberal Party leader John Turner argued the trade pact that preceded NAFTA would reduce the country “to a colony of the United States” dependent on the impulses of its corporations. Turner lost that year’s election, but a million more Canadians voted for the anti-free-trade candidates than against them. (The author of my talismanic new history book, David Orchard, was one of the leaders of the movement.) So a student of Canadian history might not have been surprised at a renewed bout of U.S. encroachment, nor the Canadian response to it. “The U.S. always seems to think, If we can threaten you economically, you’ll just come and join us,” says Christopher Sands, an expert on U.S.-Canada relations. Sands used to direct the Wilson Center’s Canada Institute, until, tellingly, the Wilson Center was dismantled by DOGE. “It has never worked. It only ever builds up a certain Canadian nationalistic response,” he said. Of course, not every single last Canadian is living life at a nonstop anti-U.S. fever pitch. Though nobody wants to be annexed, there tends to be an older-white-liberal bent to the most fervent of the new patriots, as at a “No Kings” rally. The cause may feel less urgent for oil-and-gas libertarians in Alberta, which is home to a growing separatist movement, or in the immigrant enclaves of the Toronto suburbs that voted Conservative in the recent election, where people were focused on housing costs and quality-of-life issues. Some demographics are bound to find the rah-rah a little embarrassing. “Elbows up, or whatever,” wrote Slate’s Toronto-based music critic Carl Wilson on his Substack, recommending some Canadian LPs for Canada Day. Others are fully catastrophizing. This past spring, Canadian author Stephen Marche war-gamed a potential conflict in The Atlantic. Given the large discrepancy in the size of the countries’ standing armies, he figured the Canadian military response would have to include civilian insurgency. “If only one in 100 Canadians took up arms against an American occupation, that force would be 10 times the estimated size of the Taliban at the outset of the Afghan War. And that force would consist of machine-learning specialists and petroleum engineers rather than shepherds and subsistence farmers,” he wrote, citing a combat expert. “Canadians cannot afford complacency.” Marche has an eight-part podcast out on the U.S. threat featuring an image of geese and eagles fighting. The plot of Michael Moore’s 1995 movie Canadian Bacon is that a U.S. president gins up anti-Canadian hate to boost his approval rating, the running joke being, Who could possibly hate a Canadian? In South Park, Canadians are depicted as a malign, weird-looking species, and the townspeople hold them responsible for corrupting the youth. What pop culture treats as prima facie farcical, Trump is doing in real life: blaming Canada. His exact motivation remains opaque. Trade tensions flared in his first term, but there was no talk of water faucets and 51st states. Some theorize Trump enjoys trolling Trudeau and, even after his resignation, just never stopped. “He always saw Trudeau as a theater major,” said someone involved in the trade negotiations. Not all of Trump’s complaints are random. His grievances with Quebec’s protectionist dairy industry, which limits imports, were shared by the Biden administration. (Milk is the third rail of Canadian politics. Carney has already pledged not to touch it in trade negotiations, lest he lose Quebec’s support.) And especially now, you can find Canadians who agree with Trump that the country should ramp up its military-defense budget to meet NATO spending obligations, as Carney has pledged to do. When it comes to the president’s outré talking points, such as the location of the 49th parallel, observers of the conflict -suspect trade hawk and White House senior counselor Peter Navarro may be in his ear. In 2018, Navarro said there was a “special place in hell” for Trudeau during routine trade talks. This year, he reportedly proposed ejecting Canada from the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network. (He denied the report.) When I texted Steve Bannon to ask what he thought of the new hostilities toward Canada, he replied, “LOVE IT.” But then, just a few months ago, Bannon struck a different tone in an interview with the Financial Times. “Canada punches way above their weight. If you look at military history, they’ve been the best ally we’ve had,” he said. Bannon didn’t pick up the phone when I tried to square the circle. “I’m not sure this has an intellectual underpinning, to be honest,” a former Trump-administration foreign-policy official told me. The tariffs themselves, should they stick, are likely to have mixed results. Canadians do fear they could decimate the auto industry. “We don’t really want cars from Canada,” Trump explained to Carney in May. “And at a certain point, it won’t make economic sense for Canada to build those cars.” That same month, General Motors announced it was eliminating a shift at its Oshawa, Ontario, plant that makes Chevrolet Silverados, resulting in roughly 650 layoffs that will take place in the fall; GM is ramping up Silverado production in Indiana. But Canada’s inclusion in Trump’s aluminum tariffs has also generated puzzlement. The U.S. gets two-thirds of its aluminum from Canada, but those smelters are mostly powered by cheap Quebec hydroelectricity the U.S. probably can’t replicate. Sylvain Maltais, the head of the aluminum-workers union in the company town of Alma, told me that there had been no layoffs and that Rio Tinto, the mining giant that owns the plants, was proceeding with existing investments. “For the moment, it’s going well. There’s not a lot of stress,” Maltais said. In the U.S., however, the prices of seltzer and cat food — and anything else that comes in a can — are expected to rise. Even if a truce is reached to end the trade war, the national resistance against America will persist. As Trump continues to belittle and toy with Canada, its people have lost faith that its neighbor will treat it decently. At the start of the conflict, commenters tended to lump Trump’s attacks on Canada as of a piece with his designs on Greenland and the Panama Canal, all of it evidence of cartoonish saber-rattling. But as the rift deepened, Canadians began taking the imperialist threat seriously. Surveying the growing imbalance between the temperate Canadian climate and drought-stricken areas of the American West, an environmental journalist recently forecast, in the magazine The Walrus, a future in which Canada becomes a strip-mined “vassal state”: “As US aquifers go dry, the lakes will be a natural place to look.” On June 15, Trump arrived in Carney’s home province of Alberta for the Group of Seven Summit, where the Canadian media and political Establishment were cautiously optimistic that the conference might produce a new trade agreement. Would the countries patch things up? Instead, in a press conference, Trump blamed Barack Obama and Trudeau (who wasn’t in power at the time) for kicking Russia out of the then-G8 for its 2014 invasion of Crimea. Trump abruptly left the next day without any progress made on a deal, and Canadians felt had all over again. In July, seemingly out of the blue, Trump threatened a new round of tariffs on all Canadian goods, posting an open letter to Carney on social media in which he complained that Canada had “financially retaliated” against the U.S. and doubled down on the assertion that Canada fails “to stop the drugs from pouring” across the border. Carney responded on X: “We are committed to continuing to work with the United States.” But, he added, “we are building Canada strong” and “strengthening our trading partnerships throughout the world.” Until his retirement from Parliament earlier this year, Charlie Angus represented a large swath of rural Ontario. A rabble-rouser who plays in an alt-country band called the Grievous Angels, Angus has remade himself as a de facto leader of the “Elbows up” movement, posting testimonials of everyday resistance on Substack and touring auditoriums across the country. The night after Trump’s G7 exit, I went to one of his events in Oshawa, the economically anxious General Motors town. Filling the theater was a mostly older crowd with a few union types mixed in. Angus launched heatedly into his one-man show. “They thought, Canada, wow, let’s go pick on the Canadians, right? I mean, what’s easier to pick on than Canadians? That’s what they thought. They thought we were pushovers. Now they’re learning,” he said. It used to be “we didn’t need a big national story. We didn’t need to be jingoistic because we had next-door neighbors who were super-loud. We just did our thing. And then suddenly, we have a government who says we don’t even have a right to exist as a nation. Overnight, something changed for every person in this country. You said, ‘Not on my watch,’ and you sat down at the kitchen table and said, ‘No, we’re not going back to Florida.’ And you called the hotel in Arizona and said, ‘I don’t care if we lose our deposit.’” If all this sounded like a civilized way to conduct a trade war, well, that only underscored the rift. It takes a special kind of belligerence to piss off the nicest people on the planet. With friends like us, who needs enemies? And if our enemies now include Canada, we probably don’t have any friends left at all. A couple of weeks before the show, Angus and I had met in Toronto at Grizzly Bar. “You think I’m going to let that fucking criminal take my country? Not a chance,” he said as we drank Canadian beers. “So suddenly we go from being really easygoing to a nation of hockey goons.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: 5 Challenges Facing New WPP CEO Cindy Rose
URL: https://www.adweek.com/agencies/5-challenges-facing-new-wpp-ceo-cindy-rose/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Incoming WPP CEO Cindy Rose has a big job ahead when she steps into the role in September. As the Microsoft exec takes the reins from Mark Read, who’s departing after seven years at the helm, she inherits a business in decline that’s struggling to keep pace with an industry in flux. In addition to addressing WPP’s structural and financial problems—it issued a shock profit warning and downgraded its 2025 growth forecast last week—Rose must stave off continued client losses and turn around morale at its agencies. Industry leaders agree that Rose has the AI and technology expertise needed to bring WPP into the future. But what’s most crucial is that she develops a clear vision for a business that’s lacked one for some time. “Hopefully the WPP board are clear about what its new strategy is, as the current one has not delivered,” said Ajaz Ahmed, founder of Studio.One and former CEO of WPP agency AKQA. As the leader of a public company, Rose will have to contend with shareholders impatient for WPP’s stock to bounce back from historic lows. This will be difficult in a sector that is “facing real pressure,” said Ahmed. “Interest rates are still high. Budgets are tight. Platforms like Meta, TikTok, and Google offer increasingly sophisticated ad tools that bypass agencies,” he said. “Consulting firms and independent agencies are winning share with a more attractive value proposition.” In that pressure cooker, Rose’s strategic decisions will, in large part, be dictated by the board’s end game: Does it want to create a real strategy for WPP’s future, or would it be better off selling the company for parts? “There’s the financial engineering side—what will produce the most value for shareholders independent of the right strategy?” said Brian Wieser, principal at Madison and Wall. “Because the stock is so, so very low, it could very well be that the board would rather see some immediate benefits.” Martin Sorrell, CEO of S4 Capital and former CEO of WPP for three decades, said it comes down to whether the business “would be better off being dismembered into its still standing constituent parts or consolidated elsewhere.” “Companies that were once part of WPP, such as Kantar, VCCP, FGS, and Globant have thrived as independent companies,” Ahmed pointed out. “The question is, could WPP realize the value in some of its assets before it’s too late, or does it want to merge and consolidate its agencies further internally?” If the board does want to pursue a future for WPP in this current state, Rose needs a clear strategy and point of view for the business—something observers agree has been lacking. “The big concern for shareholders and employees isn’t just the structure; it’s the absence of a clear, credible plan,” Ahmed said. “For a while now, it’s felt like WPP has been making it up as it goes along.” For Wieser, that challenge gets to the heart of an existential industry issue: “how do you organize a modern agency group, and what should the agency services industry look like?” While Read merged agencies under WPP to streamline its unwieldy operations, he hasn’t gone as far as his peers in operating the company as a single brand. Instead, he’s touted the importance of agency brands as levers for attracting clients and talent, Wieser said. But that approach has drawbacks for WPP, including adding “layers of non-billable overhead both at the central level and within the agencies,” as well as “tremendous duplication of services,” Ahmed said. “Ogilvy has become a holding company within a holding company, which isn’t exactly simplification.” Wieser agreed that agency mergers weren’t a real strategy. “That was desperation,” he said. “There’s a recognition these will be loss-making entities on their own, so let’s do the bare minimum.” Coming in as an industry outsider, Rose will have to quickly develop a point of view on the role of agency brands and identify the right structure to take WPP into the future. “Being both a holding company and a client-facing brand at the same time as managing dozens of agency brands with their individual cultures, leadership teams, and operations is confusing, and this model hasn’t worked for WPP,” Ahmed said. Under Read, WPP invested millions of dollars into WPP Open, its internal AI platform. It will be Rose’s job to make that bet pay off—and set WPP up for an AI-powered future. “The significant investment into WPP Open hasn’t yielded the growth that was hyped a couple of years ago,” Ahmed said. According to Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester, WPP chose a tech executive with an AI background for exactly that reason: “The selection of Rose is designed, in part, to further commercialize WPP Open,” he said. Ahmed agreed that Rose’s experience at Microsoft, which “hasn’t exactly been shy about reinventing themselves over the years,” will be useful in pushing WPP to adapt to automation. But whether that’s enough to transform the legacy holding company’s business model remains to be seen. “WPP is a services company, not a software company,” Pattisall agreed. “Modernizing WPP itself, as it reconciles with automation and change, will be no small task.” “I’m not convinced that agencies can build a SaaS-type business in competition with software companies like Adobe,” Sorrell added. Rose is taking over a business where morale is low and client relationships are tenuous. WPP has lost several major clients this year, including Mars and Coca-Cola. Meanwhile, ongoing layoffs and a botched return-to-work mandate have led to discontent and anxiety among staff. Sorrell pointed to what he views as a misguided simplification strategy under Read, which collapsed brands like J. Walter Thompson, Young & Rubicam, and Wunderman, as the reason WPP has lost “not only many talented leaders, but clients as a result too.” Nick Emery, CEO of agency Jellyfish and a former WPP Media exec, believes Rose’s biggest challenge will be to “fight for, protect, and champion the many brilliant people who’ve given their all to the company—and to craft a strategy that makes them happier, drives growth for clients, and fully embraces the role of AI to fulfill the promise of technology.” Rose’s attention here must be “24/7, laser-focused on the USA,” according to Sorrell, which is “undoubtedly the center of the client world and where WPP people are probably most demoralized.” “You have to hope—if you’re hoping for good things for WPP—that she’s an excellent manager,” Wieser added. “That’s probably the single most important issue.” Rose’s industry outsider status could be a challenge or benefit, depending who you ask. Ahmed described her as “a safe pair of hands” as “an internal candidate with an external vantage point.” Sorrell said she fits WPP board chairman Philip Jansen’s criteria as a technology and AI-forward executive. But Wieser pointed out that in addition to this being her first CEO gig, her only ad industry experience has been through the vantage point of sitting on WPP’s board. “You really haven’t actually lived and breathed the industry,” he said of Rose. “It’s plausible that your views on the industry might be incomplete.” However, he added, “it can also mean fresh eyes, which is not a bad thing at all,” pointing to Michael Roth’s successful tenure at IPG. What’s crucial is that Rose surrounds herself with executives that have “clarity of vision.” “It’s going to come down to good management,” he said.

Title: Nvidia dethrones Apple as king of market milestones
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2025/07/14/nvidia-dethrones-apple-as-king-of-market-milestones/

Nvidia is the world’s first $4 trillion company, leaving Apple – long the king of market milestones – in its wake. Apple was the first to hit $1 trillion, $2 trillion and $3 trillion. But while its market capitalisation ($3.15 trillion) has idled since first closing above that landmark in mid-2023, Nvidia’s has quadrupled, fuelled by insatiable demand for its AI chips. Even that understates Nvidia’s rise: the stock is up more than 1,000 per cent since early 2023. [ Nvidia outpaces Microsoft and Apple on path to $4 trillion valuationOpens in new window ] That sounds bubbly, but staggering revenue growth suggests otherwise. Revenues rose 69 per cent last quarter to $44 billion, with another record forecast for this one. Its top customers – Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet – are to spend $350 billion on capital expenditure this year, much of it on Nvidia hardware. Valuation remains punchy, but not absurd. Nvidia’s price-sales ratio is nearly four times that of Apple’s, but the difference between their forward price-earnings ratios is slight. Nvidia bulls will note its growth rate is exponentially higher than Apple’s and its PEG ratio (which adjusts for earnings growth) is actually far lower. Apple is stable and cash-rich, but slow growth means it’s far from cheap. Nvidia appears riskier, but it keeps growing into its multiple. For now at least, investors are willing to pay up for speed over stability.

Title: War Takes Everything
URL: https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/07/war_takes_everything.html
Time Published: 2025-07-14T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
As Peter Schweizer noted in a short report for the Hoover Institution on Christmas Day 2000, twenty-five years ago the United States was “spending less on defense as a percentage of GNP than anytime since the Great Depression.” That all changed nine months later when the so-called “peace dividend” from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War was reinvested in a “Global War on Terrorism.” Eight trillion dollars later, and what do Americans have to show for their sacrifices in blood and treasure? The Taliban is in control of Afghanistan, al-Qaeda is in control of Syria, an apologist for Islamic jihad is about to become mayor of New York City, and a pro-Hamas contingent of lawmakers wields too much power in Congress. In an article that resembles an obituary for U.S. foreign policy during the twenty-first century, writer Daniel McAdams dryly observes in the headline, “‘Global War on Terror’ Is Over. Terror Won.” That’s quite the gut punch for everyone who lived through 9/11 and its aftermath. Yet it’s hardly inaccurate. A quarter-century after Islamic terrorists murdered three thousand Americans, politicians are more concerned about “Islamophobia” in the United States than providing adequate care for veterans who confronted Islamic barbarity head-on. The hurt feelings of those who risked nothing to defend the homeland matter more than the damaged bodies and minds of those who risked everything. The significance of 9/11 has been so watered-down that Congresswoman Ilhan Omar remembers it only as a day when “some people did something.” For the victims we lost, their families, members of the military who fought and died on the global battlefield, and the families of those servicemembers who never saw their loved ones again, that “something” was — by far — the most consequential event in their lives. Now it’s just an opportunity for foreigners who become members of Congress to guilt-trip white people for their imaginary “privilege.” After 9/11, everybody insisted that we left our guard down and somehow brought the tragedy upon ourselves. If we had only continued spending on defense at the same high levels that we had been spending since WWII, then we could have prevented the worst attack on American soil since the Japanese Empire bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941. That was the supposed lesson. It didn’t matter that we were still spending more than every other country in the world; as soon as we cut back on Cold War military spending, we suffered another surprise attack. We were vulnerable, everyone agreed, unless we rededicated tax dollars toward huge military budgets. Everybody in the defense sector got big buckets of money after that. Weapons manufacturers, research and development firms, intelligence think tanks, and foreign policy consultants made out like bandits. The FBI got new domestic surveillance powers. The Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration came into existence. The CIA positioned itself once again as the unofficial quarterback of the U.S. government. Unelected bureaucrats, in other words, became much more powerful than they were before 9/11, and the defense industry started cashing much bigger checks. All the institutions that experienced a diminishment of clout and prestige after the Cold War found their clout and prestige supercharged in the post-9/11 world. That’s a pretty sobering reminder that some people always benefit from tragedy. How did the American people make out? Not so well. In return for a foreign attack on U.S. soil, American citizens lost any claims to their privacy. The Patriot Act (apparently already written and ready to be signed into law as soon as a sufficient emergency could justify its passage in Congress) birthed the modern national security surveillance State. Americans lost control over their bank records, phone calls, text messages, and emails. It became common to hear politicians justify this loss of personal privacy as a trifling matter for Americans with nothing to hide. On 9/11, foreign terrorists murdered U.S. citizens; after 9/11, the U.S. government murdered the Fourth Amendment. Americans also saw the accelerated migration of foreign nationals into their local communities. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama seemed to agree that American citizens were responsible not only for prosecuting a “Global War on Terrorism” but also for resettling “refugees” from newly occupied territories into the United States. The end result has been a confusing and disruptive injection of multiculturalism this century. Had Americans known that defending their way of life would involve importing millions of foreign nationals with a different way of life, many never would have supported post-9/11 wars in parts of Asia and Africa and across the Middle East. Effectively, the U.S. government responded to the worst attack since WWII by going to war for two decades, tearing up parts of the Constitution, and undermining Americans’ shared culture. Those politicians and bureaucrats in D.C. who have seen their powers expand this century believe the enormous costs in lives and dollars are justified. Those industries that profit from endless war have had much to celebrate. For many Americans, however, the butcher’s bill from this century’s military conflicts has not been pretty. Right now the drumbeat of war is growing louder. U.S. and European interests see Ukraine as an expendable chess piece in a larger NATO-led war against Russia. As the death toll in Europe rises, Western war-hawks continue to demand that every last Ukrainian man be press-ganged into service. I have made no secret of my contempt for those who insist that Ukrainians die in this war when they are not permitted to vote for elected representatives or even to dissent publicly from the government currently hanging onto power through martial law. There is nothing “democratic” about this Ukrainian dictatorship. I dislike the Council on Foreign Relations types who lick their chops over the possibility of defeating Russia and dismantling its enormous territory into more digestible parts. I dislike the BlackRock vultures that can’t wait to gobble up the region’s natural resources while making trillions of dollars from government-subsidized rebuilding projects across the war-torn terrain. I dislike the bloodthirsty loudmouths, such as Lindsey Graham, who speak of war as if it’s a playground game. I dislike the Machiavellian politicians (particularly in Europe) who see the War in Ukraine as a convenient distraction from the exorbitant energy costs of “climate change” communism presently destroying Western economies. I dislike those who would risk miscalculations between nuclear powers over former Soviet lands whose peoples largely identify as Russian. I dislike those who prefer that Russian and Ukrainian Christians kill each other rather than seek peace. Before we ratchet up the slaughter in Europe and expand the Russia-NATO proxy war in Ukraine into something even more devastating than it already is, consider how much we’ve sacrificed this century. The “peace dividend” following the Cold War didn’t even last a decade. When the United States committed itself to a post-9/11 “Global War on Terrorism” for the next twenty years, we watched our Bill of Rights and culture slip away. Whether one thinks the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were worth their costs, those costs will look minuscule next to the butcher’s bill that will come due in a full-out war between Russia and U.S.-NATO. Those European and American parents who believe that their children will never be drafted into service should remember that Ukrainian parents once believed the same thing. There is an abyss before us. If we fall into it, we will lose ourselves. The madness will be bloody and awful, and we will be lucky to see it through. War takes everything. It robs everyone. I pray that we can avoid it. Image: CristianIS via Pixabay, Pixabay License. As Peter Schweizer noted in a short report for the Hoover Institution on Christmas Day 2000, twenty-five years ago the United States was “spending less on defense as a percentage of GNP than anytime since the Great Depression.” That all changed nine months later when the so-called “peace dividend” from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War was reinvested in a “Global War on Terrorism.” Eight trillion dollars later, and what do Americans have to show for their sacrifices in blood and treasure? The Taliban is in control of Afghanistan, al-Qaeda is in control of Syria, an apologist for Islamic jihad is about to become mayor of New York City, and a pro-Hamas contingent of lawmakers wields too much power in Congress. In an article that resembles an obituary for U.S. foreign policy during the twenty-first century, writer Daniel McAdams dryly observes in the headline, “‘Global War on Terror’ Is Over. Terror Won.” That’s quite the gut punch for everyone who lived through 9/11 and its aftermath. Yet it’s hardly inaccurate. A quarter-century after Islamic terrorists murdered three thousand Americans, politicians are more concerned about “Islamophobia” in the United States than providing adequate care for veterans who confronted Islamic barbarity head-on. The hurt feelings of those who risked nothing to defend the homeland matter more than the damaged bodies and minds of those who risked everything. The significance of 9/11 has been so watered-down that Congresswoman Ilhan Omar remembers it only as a day when “some people did something.” For the victims we lost, their families, members of the military who fought and died on the global battlefield, and the families of those servicemembers who never saw their loved ones again, that “something” was — by far — the most consequential event in their lives. Now it’s just an opportunity for foreigners who become members of Congress to guilt-trip white people for their imaginary “privilege.” After 9/11, everybody insisted that we left our guard down and somehow brought the tragedy upon ourselves. If we had only continued spending on defense at the same high levels that we had been spending since WWII, then we could have prevented the worst attack on American soil since the Japanese Empire bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941. That was the supposed lesson. It didn’t matter that we were still spending more than every other country in the world; as soon as we cut back on Cold War military spending, we suffered another surprise attack. We were vulnerable, everyone agreed, unless we rededicated tax dollars toward huge military budgets. Everybody in the defense sector got big buckets of money after that. Weapons manufacturers, research and development firms, intelligence think tanks, and foreign policy consultants made out like bandits. The FBI got new domestic surveillance powers. The Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration came into existence. The CIA positioned itself once again as the unofficial quarterback of the U.S. government. Unelected bureaucrats, in other words, became much more powerful than they were before 9/11, and the defense industry started cashing much bigger checks. All the institutions that experienced a diminishment of clout and prestige after the Cold War found their clout and prestige supercharged in the post-9/11 world. That’s a pretty sobering reminder that some people always benefit from tragedy. How did the American people make out? Not so well. In return for a foreign attack on U.S. soil, American citizens lost any claims to their privacy. The Patriot Act (apparently already written and ready to be signed into law as soon as a sufficient emergency could justify its passage in Congress) birthed the modern national security surveillance State. Americans lost control over their bank records, phone calls, text messages, and emails. It became common to hear politicians justify this loss of personal privacy as a trifling matter for Americans with nothing to hide. On 9/11, foreign terrorists murdered U.S. citizens; after 9/11, the U.S. government murdered the Fourth Amendment. Americans also saw the accelerated migration of foreign nationals into their local communities. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama seemed to agree that American citizens were responsible not only for prosecuting a “Global War on Terrorism” but also for resettling “refugees” from newly occupied territories into the United States. The end result has been a confusing and disruptive injection of multiculturalism this century.

Rupee falls below 86 against USD due to foreign fund outflows and trade deal delay, impacted by global factors. Today, the Indian stock market closed in negative territory with the Nifty 50 ending at 25,082.45, down approximately 67 points or 0.27%, and the Sensex falling over 247 points. The decline was primarily driven by broad-based selling pressure in the IT sector, which acted as the key laggard. Major IT stocks such as Wipro, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) witnessed average declines of 1.5%, with TCS’s subdued quarterly earnings and cautious outlook weighing heavily on sentiment. Global cues also remained weak, with concerns over the ongoing trade war and anticipation of US inflation data contributing to cautious investor behavior. Despite the negative close, some pockets such as select banking and pharmaceutical stocks showed resilience, but their gains were insufficient to offset the broad market weakness. The market breadth was skewed towards declines, reflecting a risk-off sentiment among investors amid mixed earnings results and geopolitical uncertainties.

With the decline in inflation on food items being the major influence in this trend is a positive sign, especially for the household consumers and food services sector. The deflated trend observed in food items, along with other factors including the CPI performance, and the recent rate cut by the MPC has enhanced liquidity flow in the hands of the masses, thereby boosting domestic consumption, and empowering the businesses in the food services sector with some relief on the margins. We foresee this performance to sustain over a period of time, driven by cautious-but-steady steps of the RBI to keep the inflation within the desired range. Having said that, there is a need to be agile and stay vigilant on the global economic and commodity trends to ensure the ripple effect of the same doesn’t hamper the domestic momentum. Karnataka Bank appoints Raghavendra Srinivas Bhat as Managing Director and CEO, highlighting his 38-year career and leadership qualities.

This was largely led by prices of food items, which declined by 0.3% after witnessing an inflation of 1.7% in the previous month, amid softer prints for fruits and vegetables, pulses, cereals, spices, and edible oils. Among the non-food items, the deflation in fuel and power also widened between these months, exerting downward pressure on the headline print. Notably, the core WPI (non-food manufactured items) inflation inched up marginally to +1.0% in June 2025 from +0.9% in May 2025, while remaining subdued. The seasonal sequential uptick in food prices has been relatively modest in July 2025 so far, which is expected to keep food print in the deflationary zone, unless there is an unusual surge in such prices in the remaining part of the month, especially for vegetables. Besides, international crude oil prices have also eased somewhat in the ongoing month from the peak seen in June 2025, amid cooling tensions in West Asia, while remaining in the deflationary territory on a YoY basis. Further, the USD/INR pair has also remained range bound so far. Overall, ICRA expects the headline WPI to remain in the deflationary territory in July 2025 despite an unfavourable base, amid the sustained YoY deflation in food and crude oil prices. With the WPI inflation averaging at just 0.4% in Offers investors a unique opportunity to build long-term wealth Fund available at ₹10 Net Asset Value (NAV) during the New Fund Offer (NFO) subscription period commencing from July 14 Becomes the first life insurer to offer this fund to its customers As investors prepared for US trade-related developments, markets took a cautious approach last week. Following a brief decline below $3300, gold has recovered, and Silver has touched new record highs. Trump said on Tuesday that copper would probably be subject to a 50% tariff. Trump then reaffirmed his warning on Wednesday to impose additional tariffs on BRICS nations and released a fresh series of letters outlining duty rates of 20%–30% on smaller trading partners like the Philippines, Algeria, and Libya. In the meantime, the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting revealed that the majority of members projected a rate reduction later this year, with any tariff-related price increase being “temporary or modest.” Over the weekend, US President Donald Trump announced that an additional 10% tariffs would be applied to nations that align with the BRICS group, an intergovernmental organization made up of Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa (founding members), India, China, Brazil, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates. Trump imposed a 30% tariff on both the EU and Mexico in letters to both countries, calling their trade deficits with the US a “major threat” to national security. Additionally, President Trump signed an executive order extending the tariff implementation deadline to August 1. Trump did, however, publish the letters they addressed to trading partners, revealing that they will be levying 25% tariffs on South Korea and Japan. For more precise clues about the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision, investors are keenly observing a number of important US economic releases this week, such as the CPI, PPI, retail sales, and industrial production.

Agri-gold lending guidelines revised RBI allowed voluntary pledge of gold and silver as collateral This is positive for PSU banks that rely on PSL certificate fee income Among PSU Banks, Union Bank, Canara Bank and Indian Bank have higher share of fee income from this business Bitcoin has rocketed to a fresh all-time high, surging past $121,000. Here’s the take of Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman, CIFDAQ, on this development: Bitcoin has smashed past $121,000, marking fresh all-time highs as institutional demand and policy tailwinds fuel the rally. The latest surge follows last week’s 10% rise, with over $289 million in short liquidations amplifying momentum. Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.2 billion in inflows on Thursday and $1.03 billion Friday, pushing total U.S. ETF net inflows beyond $50 billion to date. The rally coincides with Congress’ “Crypto Week,” where lawmakers will vote on the CLARITY Act, Anti-CBDC Act, and GENIUS Act, aiming to establish regulatory clarity and permanently block CBDCs. With Trump’s pro-crypto policies, regulatory easing, and macro uncertainty, Bitcoin’s case as a mainstream asset is rapidly solidifying.

While Trump has allowed room for negotiations until August 1, the potential for a rapid escalation has kept risk assets under pressure, prompting investors to seek safety in haven assets like gold. Looking ahead, inflation data due on Tuesday, along with a busy week of corporate earnings, will help shape gold’s near-term direction. However, the strength of the U.S. dollar, bolstered by these trade uncertainties, may limit further gains in the precious metal.” Anthem Biosciences Limited’s ₹3,395 crore initial public offering received a tepid response on its first day, with the issue subscribed only 0.19 times by midday Monday.

The prices largely hovered around USD 3,300 – 3,350, thus remaining rangebound. The influence of the same is majorly due to the strengthening of dollar which kept the markets in mild pressure. The ripple effect of this can also be seen in the domestic gold prices where the prices remained well within the range of INR 97,000 – 99,000 / 10gms during the week. This trend will sustain in the short-term as we await the final disclosure of the Trump Tariff as this announcement will have a major influence on the gold prices.

Source: Reuters Crude oil futures traded higher on Monday morning as markets awaited a ‘major announcement’ by US President Donald Trump on Russia. At 9.22 am on Monday, September Brent oil futures were at $70.50, up by 0.20 per cent, and August crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $68.60, up by 0.22 per cent. July crude oil futures were trading at ₹5899 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Monday against the previous close of ₹5881, up by 0.31 per cent, and August futures were trading at ₹5797 against the previous close of ₹5779, up by 0.31 per cent. ● Total Income grew to ₹7,819.82 million, up 11.34% from ₹7,023.56 million in FY24, driven by higher daily dispatches, an expanded vendor base and greater wallet share from repeat customers. ● EBITDA rose to ₹579.75 million, up 345.3% YoY, with margin expansion of 561 basis points to 7.48%, supported by a strategic product mix shift, growing share of third-party manufactured products, expanding services and operational efficiency. ● PAT for FY25 was ₹60.13 million, compared to a loss of ₹172.98 million in FY24 reflecting a strong turnaround driven by scale, stronger margins and disciplined cost control, despite absorbing ₹73.73 million in IPO-related expenses. Shares up 1.69% on the NSE to ₹165.90 Morning Outlook – 14th July 2025 Indian benchmark indices are expected to open on a flat to slightly negative note today, as suggested by the GIFT Nifty, which indicates a marginal decline of around 34 points in the Nifty 50. Market sentiment remains mildly indecisive, following a cautious close in the previous session. The Nifty 50 opened weak and traded in a narrow range for most of the session. However, a sudden sell-off towards the end dragged the index lower, forming a bearish candlestick that signals negative sentiment. Technically, a sustained move above 25,378 could pave the way for an upward rally toward 25,500. On the downside, immediate support is seen at 25,120 and 25,000, which may serve as potential entry points for long trades if stability emerges around these levels. The Bank Nifty ended the session in the red, losing 201 points, and formed a bearish candlestick with a long upper wick, reflecting selling pressure at higher levels. A decisive breakdown below 56,600 could lead to further downside toward 56,420 and 56,234. However, if these support levels hold, a reversal may follow, offering fresh buying opportunities. On the upside, resistance lies in the 56,817–57,000 zone, with a breakout above this range potentially triggering a rally toward 57,175. On the institutional front, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers of equities worth ₹5,104 crore on July 11, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) were net buyers, investing ₹3,558 crore. In the current environment of heightened volatility and mixed market signals, traders are advised to follow a cautious “sell on rise” strategy, especially when trading with leverage. Booking partial profits on rallies and using tight trailing stop-losses is recommended to manage risk effectively. Fresh long positions should only be considered if the Nifty sustains above the 25,378 level. While the broader market undertone remains cautiously bullish, it is essential to keep a close watch on key technical levels and global market cues.

The fall was mainly due to a $3.53 billion drop in foreign currency assets, which stood at $591.29 billion. In contrast, gold reserves rose by $342 million to $84.5 billion, SDRs increased by $39 million to $18.86 billion, while the IMF reserve position declined by $107 million to $4.73 billion during the same period. 2)Overseas investors repatriated a record $97.7 billion from Indian investments in FY25. This is up from $87.5 billion in FY24. The increase is due to higher FDI inflows and debt investments. RBI data indicates a rise in income from foreign exchange reserves deployment. Indian companies also increased overseas investments. This balanced the investment income segment of the current account. 3)As of July 4, 2025, the RBI’s weekly data shows that loans to state governments rose sharply by ₹10,890 crore over the week to ₹30,956 crore. Scheduled Commercial Banks’ aggregate deposits stood at ₹234.26 lakh crore, growing 1.5% fortnightly and 10.1% YoY, while bank credit rose to ₹184.83 lakh crore, up 0.9% fortnightly and 9.5% YoY. Within M3 (money supply), which rose 9.6% YoY to ₹281.77 lakh crore, demand deposits showed strong 17.1% annual growth. Liquidity operations reflected large-scale absorption by the RBI via the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF), peaking at ₹3.32 lakh crore on July 4, with net daily absorption consistently exceeding ₹2.5 lakh crore throughout the week, indicating tight liquidity management. 4)As of June 27, 2025, aggregate deposits of all scheduled banks rose to ₹239.16 lakh crore from ₹235.62 lakh crore in mid-June, with demand deposits at ₹31.22 lakh crore and time deposits at ₹207.95 lakh crore. Bank credit (excluding inter-bank) increased to ₹189.53 lakh crore from ₹187.84 lakh crore, led by loans and advances of ₹186.10 lakh crore. Investments stood at ₹68.54 lakh crore, mainly in central and state government securities. Balances with the RBI were stable at ₹9.53 lakh crore, while cash held fell slightly to ₹89,278 crore. Borrowings from the RBI dropped to ₹1,065 crore, and food credit by scheduled commercial banks declined marginally to ₹64,389 crore from ₹67,606 crore in mid-June. The total number of scheduled commercial banks remained at 120. 5)In June, mutual fund inflows surged 67% month-on-month to ₹49,301 crore from ₹29,572 crore in May, with total AUM rising 3% to ₹74.14 lakh crore. Equity mutual funds saw inflows jump 24% to ₹23,587 crore, led by flexi-cap funds (₹5,733 crore), small-cap (₹4,024 crore), and mid-cap funds (₹3,754 crore), while ELSS recorded outflows of ₹556 crore. Debt funds saw reduced outflows of ₹1,711 crore (vs ₹15,908 crore in May), with short duration (₹10,276 crore) and money market funds (₹9,484 crore) leading inflows; liquid funds faced the highest outflow at ₹25,196 crore. Hybrid funds’ inflows rose 12% to ₹23,222 crore, with arbitrage funds leading at ₹15,584 crore and aggressive hybrid funds jumping 290% to ₹1,331 crore. Passive funds saw inflows drop 28% to ₹3,997 crore, though gold ETFs surged 613% to ₹2,080 crore. 6)SIP inflows hit a fresh all-time high of ₹27,269 crore in June, up 2% from ₹26,688 crore in May, marking the first time inflows crossed the ₹27,000 crore mark. SIP AUM rose to ₹15.30 lakh crore from ₹14.61 lakh crore. New SIP registrations grew to 61.91 lakh in June from 59.14 lakh in May and 46.01 lakh in April, while contributing SIP accounts reached 8.64 crore, up from 8.56 crore in May. Total mutual fund folios rose to 24.13 crore in June from 23.83 crore in May, and retail folios (Equity + Hybrid + Solution Oriented) stood at 19.07 crore (vs. 18.84 crore in May). Retail AUM increased to ₹4,43,994 crore in June from ₹4,21,954 crore in May. 7)JPMorgan is considering reducing the weight of top bond issuers like China and India in its GBI-EM Global Diversified index by lowering the country cap from 10% to 8.5%. The move aims to diversify exposure across emerging markets, potentially raising the index’s average yield by giving more weight to higher-yielding, riskier countries—impacting over $200 billion in funds tracking the benchmark. 8)India’s corporate bond market is set for a major transformation with the launch of Bond Central, a SEBI- and OBPP-backed platform that offers a centralized, transparent database for bond issuances. By providing easy access to pricing, risk metrics, and disclosures, and lowering the minimum investment to ₹10,000, the platform aims to boost retail participation, enhance price discovery, and align with global standards like FINRA TRACE. WORLD 1)The IEA’s July 2025 Oil Market Report highlights a volatile first half of the year for global oil markets, marked by slowing demand growth due to a weaker economic outlook and rising clean energy adoption, particularly in non-OECD countries like China. While seasonal demand is expected to pick up, global supply rose in May as OPEC+ and non-OPEC+ producers increased output, with non-OPEC+ set to drive future growth. Inventories surged, especially in non-OECD regions, and oil prices fluctuated widely amid geopolitical tensions and OPEC+ policy shifts. Refinery margins peaked in May but were later squeezed by crude price hikes. The report also noted rising NGL output and the impact of global trade and energy policy shifts on market dynamics. 2)The FOMC minutes from the June 17–18, 2025 meeting showed the Fed held rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% while continuing balance sheet runoff, set to conclude by Feb 2026. While Q2 GDP rebounded and unemployment held at 4.2%, core PCE inflation at 2.6% remained above target. Tariffs and geopolitical risks may pose near-term inflation pressures, but wage growth was seen as contained. Risks remain tilted toward higher inflation and slower growth, with most members expecting 1–2 rate cuts in 2025, likely starting in September, though views differ. The Fed reaffirmed a data-dependent approach and discussed enhancing policy communication tools. 3)US jobless claims fell to 227K for the week ending July 5, below expectations and down from the revised 232K the prior week. The insured unemployment rate held steady at 1.3%, while the four-week average dropped to 235.5K. However, continuing jobless claims rose by 10K to 1.965 million for the week ending June 28. 4)The latest US Redbook Index (YoY) reading is 5.9%, as of July 2025, according to Trading Economics. This is up from the previous reading of 4.9%. The Redbook Index measures year-over-year same-store sales growth in a sample of large US general merchandise retailers. 5)The UK economy contracted by 0.1% in May, missing expectations of 0.1% growth and following a 0.3% decline in April, according to ONS data. The services index slowed to 0.4% (3M/3M) from 0.6%, while industrial and manufacturing production dropped 0.9% and 1% respectively, both below market forecasts. 6)The UK’s trade deficit widened by £6.7 billion to £13.2 billion in the three months to May, driven by a £6.1 billion rise in the goods deficit to £61 billion and a £0.6 billion dip in the services surplus to £47.8 billion. In May, both exports and imports rose by £0.6 billion. Notably, UK goods exports to the US rose by £0.3 billion, while imports from the US fell £0.9 billion, amid shifts in US trade policy despite a new trade deal effective from June 30. 7)The Bank of England’s July 2025 Financial Stability Report highlights that the UK financial system remains resilient despite rising global risks. Mortgage repayments are set to rise for millions, prompting a relaxation in high loan-to-income limits to support first-time buyers. Key risks include global trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty, vulnerabilities in non-bank finance, and climate change. The BoE is also reviewing capital buffer frameworks and enhancing climate risk integration to strengthen systemic stability. 8)Japan’s producer prices rose 2.9% YoY in June 2025, easing from 3.2% in May and marking the lowest print since August 2024, in line with forecasts. On a monthly basis, prices fell 0.2%, following a 0.1% drop in May, signaling continued softening in input costs. 9)China’s CPI rose 0.1% YoY in June, rebounding slightly from May’s -0.1% and beating expectations of 0%, while monthly CPI slipped 0.1%. Meanwhile, PPI declined 3.6% YoY, deeper than May’s 3.3% fall and below the expected 3.2%, signaling continued deflationary pressure in factory prices. 10)In a surprise move, the Reserve Bank of Australia held interest rates steady at 3.85% on July 8, despite market expectations of a cut. The decision, passed by a 6–3 vote, reflects the RBA’s view that inflation risks are more balanced and the labour market remains strong, though uncertainty around demand and supply persists. The board chose to wait for more data to confirm inflation is on track to sustainably reach its 2.5% target. 11)The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) board members decided to maintain the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 3.25% following the conclusion of the July policy meeting on Wednesday. The decision aligned with the market expectations. The RBNZ stood pat on the policy rate after six consecutive cuts. Siemens: Company secures two separate orders worth Rs 773 cr from MAHA-METRO.

Title: Will US Exchanges Follow The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)’s Lead In Nudging Chronic Underperformers?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/shivaramrajgopal/2025/07/13/will-us-exchanges-follow-the-tokyo-stock-exchange-tses-lead-in-nudging-chronic-underperformers/

ByShivaram Rajgopal ByShivaram Rajgopal, Contributor. Senso-Ji ancient buddhist temple illuminated at night in Asakusa. Senso-Ji is Tokyo's oldest and ... More most significant temple The TSE asks firms with price to book (P/B) of less than 1 to publish turnaround plans. Around 23% of US firms have a P/B less than 1. In March 2023, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) put out an interesting rule/nudge or guidance: companies on the TSE, whose P/B ratio was less than one, over multiple years, are encouraged to disclose, on an annual basis, information on specific initiatives to improve profitability and market valuation, as well as the schedule for their implementation. Companies risk delisting if these directives are not followed. This is an intriguing nudge to get under-performers to publicly discuss plans for turning themselves around or for cash hoarders to buy back stock and/or payout dividends. The rule is especially pertinent to a market like Japan where shareholder activism is still at a nascent stage which in turn makes it becomes difficult for shareholder activists such an Elliott or a Trian to target such under-performers. What is so special about P/B struggling at less than one for a while? No one ratio or metric is ever definitive. But, P/B < 1 is a quick and easy heuristic symptomatic of problems that deserve the CEO’s and board’s attention: (i) the company’s future earnings stream does not even pay for the cost of equity held in the firm; (ii) the firm is sitting on assets over-valued in its books and the market is asking the firm to take a write down (a topic I had covered a while ago); (iii) the firm has negative debt (or cash in excess of debt) suggesting that is either under-levered or is better off returning cash to shareholders who can earn a higher rate of return than the firm can generate on cash, either held in marketable securities or invested in the business; or (iv) the firm is doing fine but the stock market has somehow not acknowledged its long term prospects. The US, to some extent, has the same problem. I found 1,547 firms, out of 6,829 firms listed on major US exchanges (including mutual funds and class A and B shares and ADRs), that report a P/B ratio of less than one as of 6/30/2025. Of these, 756 are listed on the NYSE and the remaining 791 are on NASDAQ. Of the 1,547 firms, 1,007 trade at a price above $5 a share, suggesting that many of these firms are not trivially small. Thus, 23% of US firms (1,547/6,829) or nearly a fourth of the sample have P/B ratio of less than one, despite the historical heights that US markets have scaled, of late. When I ran the same screen for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, I ended up with 1,668 firms out of a total of 4,333 firms (38%) with a P/B less than one. Yes, the proportion is higher for the TSE but a 23% number for US exchanges still sounds quite high to me. Surprisingly, many prominent US listed firms report a P/B of less than one: Citibank, Baidu, Rogers Corporation, KB Home, General Motors, Molson Coors, United Bancshares, Arcelor Mittal, Fresh Del Monte Produce, Ziff Davis, Echostar, Honda Motor Company, Deutsche Bank, Harley Davidson, Foot Locker, Murphy Oil, Sirius XM, Barclays, Paramount, Ford Motor Company, Liberty Energy, several Invesco, Nuveen and Blackrock funds, Biovie, Kohl’s, Clarivate, and Lloyds Banking Corporation. Nearly a fourth of the market is simply too long a list for activists to go after, even in the US, setting aside any considerations of a financial return to activism. I have highlighted how many of these firms potentially have an agency problem in that the board or the CEO is stuck and somehow unable to break the rut and the usual checks and balance such as relatively passive institutional holders, proxy advisors or even index makers such as S&P have not pressured them to turn things around. When the usual checks and balances fail, can and should the exchange step in? Will US exchanges be willing to follow TSE’s lead and announce a similar rule asking managers to share concrete plans for a turnaround? Has the TSE’s plan worked in Japan? It might be too early to tell for sure but companies have started sharing concrete initiatives. For instance, A lot of this looks and sounds like Financial Management 101 but it is not a bad idea to force CEOs and boards to acknowledge their laggard status and ask for concrete steps they plan on taking to improve return on shareholder capital. What about enforcement? Aside from the threat of delisting, short-listing the P/B laggards could potentially spotlight these firms and on the margin, goad institutional investors, index providers, proxy advisors, sell side analysts and rating agencies to hold management’s feet to the fire in making sure that the announced plans are followed through. Will the NYSE and NASDAQ consider TSE’s out-of-the-box idea to pull up chronic under-performers?

Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. The company is also a leading supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs. Its GeForce line of GPUs is aimed at the consumer market and is used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads global sales of discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny’s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose. The three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: “We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don’t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems. During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 start-up companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future. Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD. In a pivotal moment, Sega’s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia’s potential and persuaded Sega’s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri’s “understanding and generosity gave us six months to live”. In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia’s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company’s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month’s payroll. The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia’s unofficial company motto: “Our company is thirty days from going out of business. In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.

The transformer engine is also capable of dynamically allocating bits in the chosen precision to either the mantissa or exponent at runtime to maximize precision.

Instead of looking at the entire sequence, the Smith–Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure. Smith–Waterman algorithm aligns two sequences by matches/mismatches (also known as substitutions), insertions, and deletions. Both insertions and deletions are the operations that introduce gaps, which are represented by dashes. The Smith–Waterman algorithm has several steps: Determine the substitution matrix and the gap penalty scheme. A substitution matrix assigns each pair of bases or amino acids a score for match or mismatch. Usually matches get positive scores, whereas mismatches get relatively lower scores. A gap penalty function determines the score cost for opening or extending gaps. It is suggested that users choose the appropriate scoring system based on the goals. In addition, it is also a good practice to try different combinations of substitution matrices and gap penalties. Initialize the scoring matrix. The dimensions of the scoring matrix are 1+length of each sequence respectively. All the elements of the first row and the first column are set to 0. The extra first row and first column make it possible to align one sequence to another at any position, and setting them to 0 makes the terminal gap free from penalty. Scoring. Score each element from left to right, top to bottom in the matrix, considering the outcomes of substitutions (diagonal scores) or adding gaps (horizontal and vertical scores). If none of the scores are positive, this element gets a 0. Otherwise the highest score is used and the source of that score is recorded. Traceback. Starting at the element with the highest score, traceback based on the source of each score recursively, until 0 is encountered. The segments that have the highest similarity score based on the given scoring system is generated in this process. To obtain the second best local alignment, apply the traceback process starting at the second highest score outside the trace of the best alignment. The Smith–Waterman algorithm finds the segments in two sequences that have similarities while the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm aligns two complete sequences. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm 18 posted on 07/13/2025 7:31:19 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep WIKI The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is an algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences. It was one of the first applications of dynamic programming to compare biological sequences. The algorithm was developed by Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch and published in 1970. The algorithm essentially divides a large problem (e.g. the full sequence) into a series of smaller problems, and it uses the solutions to the smaller problems to find an optimal solution to the larger problem. It is also sometimes referred to as the optimal matching algorithm and the global alignment technique. The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is still widely used for optimal global alignment, particularly when the quality of the global alignment is of the utmost importance. The algorithm assigns a score to every possible alignment, and the purpose of the algorithm is to find all possible alignments having the highest score. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm 19 posted on 07/13/2025 7:34:08 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep Maybe he buy a sport jacket. 20 posted on 07/14/2025 2:25:03 AM PDT by minnesota_bound (Making money now.

Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. The company is also a leading supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs. Its GeForce line of GPUs is aimed at the consumer market and is used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads global sales of discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny’s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose. The three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: “We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don’t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems. During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 start-up companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future. Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD. In a pivotal moment, Sega’s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia’s potential and persuaded Sega’s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri’s “understanding and generosity gave us six months to live”. In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia’s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company’s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month’s payroll. The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia’s unofficial company motto: “Our company is thirty days from going out of business. In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware.

A gap penalty function determines the score cost for opening or extending gaps. It is suggested that users choose the appropriate scoring system based on the goals. In addition, it is also a good practice to try different combinations of substitution matrices and gap penalties. Initialize the scoring matrix. The dimensions of the scoring matrix are 1+length of each sequence respectively. All the elements of the first row and the first column are set to 0. The extra first row and first column make it possible to align one sequence to another at any position, and setting them to 0 makes the terminal gap free from penalty. Scoring. Score each element from left to right, top to bottom in the matrix, considering the outcomes of substitutions (diagonal scores) or adding gaps (horizontal and vertical scores). If none of the scores are positive, this element gets a 0. Otherwise the highest score is used and the source of that score is recorded. Traceback. Starting at the element with the highest score, traceback based on the source of each score recursively, until 0 is encountered. The segments that have the highest similarity score based on the given scoring system is generated in this process. To obtain the second best local alignment, apply the traceback process starting at the second highest score outside the trace of the best alignment. The Smith–Waterman algorithm finds the segments in two sequences that have similarities while the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm aligns two complete sequences. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm 18 posted on 07/13/2025 7:31:19 PM PDT by Brian Griffin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: nwrep WIKI The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is an algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences. It was one of the first applications of dynamic programming to compare biological sequences. The algorithm was developed by Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch and published in 1970. The algorithm essentially divides a large problem (e.g. the full sequence) into a series of smaller problems, and it uses the solutions to the smaller problems to find an optimal solution to the larger problem. It is also sometimes referred to as the optimal matching algorithm and the global alignment technique. The Needleman–Wunsch algorithm is still widely used for optimal global alignment, particularly when the quality of the global alignment is of the utmost importance.

Huang has created probably ten million more jobs than all those commies put together. Pelosi has gotten so rich off this guy. At least he created something. Pelosi, Omar, Crockett, Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders, have never created anything... He and the other two started the company off with $40,000 and used a townhouse owned by one of them for an office. How long until some judgie poo says he’s paid too much and takes back money from his pay ? I would rather have Buffet’s portfolio. We're blessed by men like Jensen Huang - men who follow their dreams, take risks and create businesses so all of us can live better lives. Capitalism works. “ Capitalism works” The proof is all around us in so many ways every single day. But the brain-dead idiots who adore communism never once ask the obvious question: “Why did NONE of these wonders originate in the Soviet Union, any Soviet “Socialist Republic,” in North Korea, in Cuba, in Venezuela?” I didn’t read the article, but I saw an article title proclaiming AMD could make Nvidia performance level chips. https://www.investopedia.com/amd-stock-popped-after-analyst-said-new-ai-chips-could-take-on-nvidias-watch-these-key-price-levels-11770309 Note: The claim is beyond my ability to verify. Nvidia and its chips have always been well-respected by me. However, $4 trillion is really big money. “Huang has created probably ten million more jobs than all those commies put together.” He has created a lot of wealth and a lot of jobs, but I doubt even one million jobs. There is going to be a lot of money made from AI, such as from education, policing and elder care, but the software development may not be fast enough to see it mostly in the form of AI chip sales profits. WIKI Nvidia Corporation[a] (/ɛnˈvɪdiə/ en-VID-ee-ə) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. The company is also a leading supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of the hardware it designs. Its GeForce line of GPUs is aimed at the consumer market and is used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads global sales of discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny’s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose. The three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: “We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don’t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems. During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 start-up companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for video games was the path to the future. Only two survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which merged into AMD. In a pivotal moment, Sega’s president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia’s potential and persuaded Sega’s management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri’s “understanding and generosity gave us six months to live”. In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia’s employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to 40—and focused the company’s remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month’s payroll. The sense of impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia’s unofficial company motto: “Our company is thirty days from going out of business. In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU, which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin. Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft’s Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. I can’t understandably describe the more recent history: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia WIKI The Hopper architecture was the first Nvidia architecture to implement the transformer engine. The transformer engine accelerates computations by dynamically reducing them from higher numerical precisions (i.e., FP16) to lower precisions that are faster to perform (i.e., FP8) when the loss in precision is deemed acceptable. The transformer engine is also capable of dynamically allocating bits in the chosen precision to either the mantissa or exponent at runtime to maximize precision. In late 2022, due to US regulations limiting the export of chips to the People’s Republic of China, Nvidia adapted the H100 chip to the Chinese market with the H800. This model has lower bandwidth compared to the original H100 model. In late 2023, the US government announced new restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, including the A800 and H800 models. This led to Nvidia creating another chip predicated on Hopper microarchitecture: the H20, a modified version of the H100. The H20 had become the most prominent chip in the Chinese market as of 2025. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture) WIKI The Smith–Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences. Instead of looking at the entire sequence, the Smith–Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure. Smith–Waterman algorithm aligns two sequences by matches/mismatches (also known as substitutions), insertions, and deletions. Both insertions and deletions are the operations that introduce gaps, which are represented by dashes. The Smith–Waterman algorithm has several steps: Determine the substitution matrix and the gap penalty scheme. A substitution matrix assigns each pair of bases or amino acids a score for match or mismatch. Usually matches get positive scores, whereas mismatches get relatively lower scores. A gap penalty function determines the score cost for opening or extending gaps. It is suggested that users choose the appropriate scoring system based on the goals.

Notebookcheck has been contacted by the person whose LinkedIn page mentioned the 2,000,000 number. They claim that it's not accurate first-party data but rather an estimate that they found online. Slightly edited article continues as follows: Earlier this year, Xbox announced that Forza Horizon 5 would become available on the PS5, nearly four years after it was released on Xbox and PC. The game eventually landed on the PlayStation 5 on April 29, 2025 as the first Forza game available on a platform other than Xbox and PC. Now, the LinkedIn page of an Xbox employee has revealed how well the game did on PlayStation. According to a post shared on X by Zuby_Tech, Forza Horizon 5 for the PlayStation 5 sold two million units in one month. The info comes from the LinkedIn page of former Xbox employee who had worked as a game designer at Turn 10 Studios, a subsidiary of Microsoft Game Studios but was recently laid off along with several others from Xbox. Listing his responsibilities at the studio, the game designer wrote that he created the cross-platform feature designs that allowed Forza Horizon 5 for the PS5 (available on Amazon for $499) to sell 2 million units in one month alone. That's an impressive figure for a video game that was released years ago on Xbox. While we don't know the total sales as of the time of writing, it most likely is well past two million units since it has been over two months since the game launched on the PS5. Xbox's recent layoffs have greatly affected Turn 10 Studios which is best known for its Forza Motorsport series. The studio lost half of its team, and has now been relegated to providing support for the Forza Horizon series. In addition, it has been reported that the Forza Motorsport series has been axed leaving the open world Forza Horizon series which is developed by Playground Games. Forza Horizon is expected to get a new installment next year. Zuby_Tech on X, Pushsquare

Title: Swiss Bishop Criticizes Marginalization and Polemics Against Roman Rite Catholics

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/13/2025 2:57:06 PM PDT by ebb tide Swiss Bishop Criticizes Marginalization and Polemics Against Roman Rite CatholicsBishop Emeritus Marian Eleganti, 70, of Switzerland, spoke with Gloria.tv about the Church and politics. Here are the main points. Full German video below.- In the Middle Ages, a Christian cosmos centred on the cathedral developed, incorporating also schools and charitable institutions. This has largely been destroyed since the Enlightenment. All godless substitute empires, such as communism and National Socialism, have failed. Now, transhumanism is attempting to recreate the human being independently of God.- There are destructive forces at work. If you look closely, you will see that they are always directed against Christianity, or more precisely, against the Catholic Church. This is supernatural. The Church has a divine origin, with the Son of God living within it in a mysterious way. The demonic, evil, anti-Christian spirit creates a counter-realm and targets Christ, its arch-enemy.- Anti-Christian forces are forming unholy alliances, for example between left-wing fascism and Islam. This enemy takes on different guises, using lies and deception, and will stop at nothing. Disguised as goodness, it makes promises that will not come.- It is an incredible way of speaking [by the German Synod] to define the sinful reality of lived sexuality - adultery, promiscuity, etc - as a source of revelation.- In the Corona era, it could be observed that the Church was a servant of the state at the expense of her faith. The Church is always threatened by embracing the world and political forces. This can be seen with taxes in German-speaking countries and sinicisation in China.- If the Church no longer believes and the thinking of bishops and Christians becomes secularised, then the Church becomes an NGO and a social institute, but not a sacrament of salvation. It then proclaims psychology, but not the supernatural presence of God.- The Church should not get involved in the dialog of contradictory scientific opinions - for example on climate change - and become an advocate for agendas, for example from the UN.- If politicians have enough power and money, they can get away with any injustice. This happens on a grand scale. Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, has burned huge sums of tax money and is not punished because of her “special personality”. Marine Le Pen wouldn’t get away with embezzlement. I don't want to rate that, I just see the different standards.- The principle of subsidiarity would prevent a concentration of power at the highest level, which could then tyrannize and dominate the masses. A country like Switzerland can decide what is good locally better than politicians in faraway Brussels.- Overall, I am an opponent of globalism and global structures. You can't govern so many people in a drop-down system. To keep this under control, you have to install more and more mechanisms that manipulate the masses, keep them in line and take away their freedom.- Attempts have been made - and this is perhaps still topical - to strive for a new world order. The elites also organize among themselves, the Bilderberg Conference or the World Economic Forum. These are exchange platforms where those who really have power and a lot of money can come together and establish a program, a strategy. Democratic control is needed here.- There is a concentration of power in a few hands, for example in asset managers such as BlackRock, whose budgets exceed the gross national product of entire countries. These are bodies without political control. They can decide autonomously.- The national parliaments and politicians are actually just shadowy figures of the donors in the background, who can no longer really make autonomous decisions.- Many images of the Apocalypse - such as animals with many heads and horns or the sign to buy and sell - play out before our eyes.- Ideologies - such as the gender ideology - are deconstructive. This not only affects the old social order, but also leads to the deconstruction of truth and reason. There is then no longer even a truth about human nature. Everything becomes the arbitrariness of feelings or interests. This can then be enforced by law.- Ideologies begin with the redefinition of language. The core of the matter is removed and only the shell is left. People talk about democracy, but there is no longer any democracy inside. You can say it's a democracy promotion law, but it's actually censorship. The protection of the narrative propagated by the state is referred to as the protection of democracy, as protection against fake news. That is the end of freedom of speech.- Theologians are the most refined sophists. And bishops have also mastered this art of speech, of saying something and nothing at the same time.- I started as an altar boy in the old rite and then retrained. I normally celebrate in the Novus Ordo. I am only now beginning to reflect on these things retrospectively: Why have these beautiful texts - such as the prayers at the Foot of the Altar or at the offertory - been canceled at the desk? These prayers also help the priest who is celebrating.- I learned the old rite because a priest from the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter asked me to do a confirmation. He has a very lively congregation with families and young people.- It is a time-honored liturgy that has been celebrated for almost 2000 years. We have around 24 rites in the Church. Why the marginalization or polemic of the faithful who love this rite?- I have wondered why the Second Vatican Council did not bring about a flowering of Faith. Paul VI already lamented this: Why was there not a renewal, but such a loss of Faith?- If you look at France, there were over 19,000 pilgrims on the pilgrimage from Paris to Chartres at Pentecost 2025 and the average age was 20. That's a generation that doesn't even know the texts of the Council. And I don't want to ask who among them has ever read an entire council text, for example Dei Verbum.- The old liturgy is very theocentric, Christocentric and the priest therefore has the central role. In the new liturgy, the danger is that the priest, who looks at the people, becomes almost like a moderator.- In the Novus Ordo, Christ's death on the cross, is overwritten by different themes. At First Communion, the rainbow is suddenly the theme. Or there is a crawling liturgy for toddlers, or a women's liturgy. The result is a workshop liturgy in which the essence is no longer recognizable. In the old Mass, the liturgical meaning is embodied in the form.

Jesus and the Apostles at the Last Supper were probably using the customary Greco-Roman posture for eating a banquet, which was to recline around a low table. Not sure how that could possibly work in a cathedral with 3000 people in attendance. The early Christians compared Christ and his coming to the rising of the sun. There's plenty of Biblical warrant for this, see Malachi 4:2, Matthew 24:27, etc. That's where "liturgical east" comes from, not from any kind of pagan syncretism. 13 posted on 07/14/2025 7:43:09 AM PDT by Campion (Everything is a grace, everything is the direct effect of our Father's love - Little Flower) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: Dr. Franklin Roman “animal sacrifice” wasn’t much like the Jewish model.

It's how they did it. Animal sacrifice was done outside their temples as that was messy, but their was a ritual that went with it that had to be done a certain way. Votive offerings were left inside the temple, which likely also had a ritual done as well. St. Paul expanded the early church throughout the Roman Empire to gentiles, and the church and its ceremonies would have become less Jewish and more Roman. I've never read of a Seder meal which required bells, but it's reasonable to assume that Roman pagan rituals used them. After Christianity became the official state religion of Rome, the statues of the old Roman gods were removed from their temples and replaced with altars and crosses. The Eastern rites of worship in the Catholic Church may be more influenced by Judaism, but the Roman Catholic mass is more Roman. 15 posted on 07/14/2025 8:51:19 AM PDT by Dr. Franklin ("A republic, if you can keep it." ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 14 | View Replies] To: Campion The Romans weren't big into worshipping the "rising sun," so it seems like you're just grasping for something that sticks.

Here are the main points. Full German video below.- In the Middle Ages, a Christian cosmos centred on the cathedral developed, incorporating also schools and charitable institutions. This has largely been destroyed since the Enlightenment. All godless substitute empires, such as communism and National Socialism, have failed. Now, transhumanism is attempting to recreate the human being independently of God.- There are destructive forces at work. If you look closely, you will see that they are always directed against Christianity, or more precisely, against the Catholic Church. This is supernatural. The Church has a divine origin, with the Son of God living within it in a mysterious way. The demonic, evil, anti-Christian spirit creates a counter-realm and targets Christ, its arch-enemy.- Anti-Christian forces are forming unholy alliances, for example between left-wing fascism and Islam. This enemy takes on different guises, using lies and deception, and will stop at nothing. Disguised as goodness, it makes promises that will not come.- It is an incredible way of speaking [by the German Synod] to define the sinful reality of lived sexuality - adultery, promiscuity, etc - as a source of revelation.- In the Corona era, it could be observed that the Church was a servant of the state at the expense of her faith. The Church is always threatened by embracing the world and political forces. This can be seen with taxes in German-speaking countries and sinicisation in China.- If the Church no longer believes and the thinking of bishops and Christians becomes secularised, then the Church becomes an NGO and a social institute, but not a sacrament of salvation. It then proclaims psychology, but not the supernatural presence of God.- The Church should not get involved in the dialog of contradictory scientific opinions - for example on climate change - and become an advocate for agendas, for example from the UN.- If politicians have enough power and money, they can get away with any injustice. This happens on a grand scale. Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, has burned huge sums of tax money and is not punished because of her “special personality”. Marine Le Pen wouldn’t get away with embezzlement. I don't want to rate that, I just see the different standards.- The principle of subsidiarity would prevent a concentration of power at the highest level, which could then tyrannize and dominate the masses. A country like Switzerland can decide what is good locally better than politicians in faraway Brussels.- Overall, I am an opponent of globalism and global structures. You can't govern so many people in a drop-down system. To keep this under control, you have to install more and more mechanisms that manipulate the masses, keep them in line and take away their freedom.- Attempts have been made - and this is perhaps still topical - to strive for a new world order. The elites also organize among themselves, the Bilderberg Conference or the World Economic Forum. These are exchange platforms where those who really have power and a lot of money can come together and establish a program, a strategy. Democratic control is needed here.- There is a concentration of power in a few hands, for example in asset managers such as BlackRock, whose budgets exceed the gross national product of entire countries. These are bodies without political control. They can decide autonomously.- The national parliaments and politicians are actually just shadowy figures of the donors in the background, who can no longer really make autonomous decisions.- Many images of the Apocalypse - such as animals with many heads and horns or the sign to buy and sell - play out before our eyes.- Ideologies - such as the gender ideology - are deconstructive. This not only affects the old social order, but also leads to the deconstruction of truth and reason. There is then no longer even a truth about human nature. Everything becomes the arbitrariness of feelings or interests. This can then be enforced by law.- Ideologies begin with the redefinition of language. The core of the matter is removed and only the shell is left. People talk about democracy, but there is no longer any democracy inside. You can say it's a democracy promotion law, but it's actually censorship. The protection of the narrative propagated by the state is referred to as the protection of democracy, as protection against fake news. That is the end of freedom of speech.- Theologians are the most refined sophists. And bishops have also mastered this art of speech, of saying something and nothing at the same time.- I started as an altar boy in the old rite and then retrained. I normally celebrate in the Novus Ordo. I am only now beginning to reflect on these things retrospectively: Why have these beautiful texts - such as the prayers at the Foot of the Altar or at the offertory - been canceled at the desk? These prayers also help the priest who is celebrating.- I learned the old rite because a priest from the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter asked me to do a confirmation. He has a very lively congregation with families and young people.- It is a time-honored liturgy that has been celebrated for almost 2000 years. We have around 24 rites in the Church. Why the marginalization or polemic of the faithful who love this rite?- I have wondered why the Second Vatican Council did not bring about a flowering of Faith. Paul VI already lamented this: Why was there not a renewal, but such a loss of Faith?- If you look at France, there were over 19,000 pilgrims on the pilgrimage from Paris to Chartres at Pentecost 2025 and the average age was 20. That's a generation that doesn't even know the texts of the Council. And I don't want to ask who among them has ever read an entire council text, for example Dei Verbum.- The old liturgy is very theocentric, Christocentric and the priest therefore has the central role. In the new liturgy, the danger is that the priest, who looks at the people, becomes almost like a moderator.- In the Novus Ordo, Christ's death on the cross, is overwritten by different themes. At First Communion, the rainbow is suddenly the theme. Or there is a crawling liturgy for toddlers, or a women's liturgy. The result is a workshop liturgy in which the essence is no longer recognizable. In the old Mass, the liturgical meaning is embodied in the form.

Jesus and the Apostles at the Last Supper were probably using the customary Greco-Roman posture for eating a banquet, which was to recline around a low table. Not sure how that could possibly work in a cathedral with 3000 people in attendance. The early Christians compared Christ and his coming to the rising of the sun. There's plenty of Biblical warrant for this, see Malachi 4:2, Matthew 24:27, etc. That's where "liturgical east" comes from, not from any kind of pagan syncretism. 13 posted on 07/14/2025 7:43:09 AM PDT by Campion (Everything is a grace, everything is the direct effect of our Father's love - Little Flower) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: Dr. Franklin Roman “animal sacrifice” wasn’t much like the Jewish model.

It's how they did it. Animal sacrifice was done outside their temples as that was messy, but their was a ritual that went with it that had to be done a certain way. Votive offerings were left inside the temple, which likely also had a ritual done as well. St. Paul expanded the early church throughout the Roman Empire to gentiles, and the church and its ceremonies would have become less Jewish and more Roman. I've never read of a Seder meal which required bells, but it's reasonable to assume that Roman pagan rituals used them. After Christianity became the official state religion of Rome, the statues of the old Roman gods were removed from their temples and replaced with altars and crosses. The Eastern rites of worship in the Catholic Church may be more influenced by Judaism, but the Roman Catholic mass is more Roman. 15 posted on 07/14/2025 8:51:19 AM PDT by Dr. Franklin ("A republic, if you can keep it." ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 14 | View Replies] To: Campion The Romans weren't big into worshipping the "rising sun," so it seems like you're just grasping for something that sticks.

Free Republic Browse · Search Religion Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson - In the Middle Ages, a Christian cosmos centred on the cathedral developed, incorporating also schools and charitable institutions. This has largely been destroyed since the Enlightenment. All godless substitute empires, such as communism and National Socialism, have failed. Now, transhumanism is attempting to recreate the human being independently of God.- There are destructive forces at work. If you look closely, you will see that they are always directed against Christianity, or more precisely, against the Catholic Church. This is supernatural. The Church has a divine origin, with the Son of God living within it in a mysterious way. The demonic, evil, anti-Christian spirit creates a counter-realm and targets Christ, its arch-enemy.- Anti-Christian forces are forming unholy alliances, for example between left-wing fascism and Islam. This enemy takes on different guises, using lies and deception, and will stop at nothing. Disguised as goodness, it makes promises that will not come.- It is an incredible way of speaking [by the German Synod] to define the sinful reality of lived sexuality - adultery, promiscuity, etc - as a source of revelation.- In the Corona era, it could be observed that the Church was a servant of the state at the expense of her faith. The Church is always threatened by embracing the world and political forces. This can be seen with taxes in German-speaking countries and sinicisation in China.- If the Church no longer believes and the thinking of bishops and Christians becomes secularised, then the Church becomes an NGO and a social institute, but not a sacrament of salvation. It then proclaims psychology, but not the supernatural presence of God.- The Church should not get involved in the dialog of contradictory scientific opinions - for example on climate change - and become an advocate for agendas, for example from the UN.- If politicians have enough power and money, they can get away with any injustice. This happens on a grand scale. Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, has burned huge sums of tax money and is not punished because of her “special personality”. Marine Le Pen wouldn’t get away with embezzlement. I don't want to rate that, I just see the different standards.- The principle of subsidiarity would prevent a concentration of power at the highest level, which could then tyrannize and dominate the masses. A country like Switzerland can decide what is good locally better than politicians in faraway Brussels.- Overall, I am an opponent of globalism and global structures. You can't govern so many people in a drop-down system. To keep this under control, you have to install more and more mechanisms that manipulate the masses, keep them in line and take away their freedom.- Attempts have been made - and this is perhaps still topical - to strive for a new world order. The elites also organize among themselves, the Bilderberg Conference or the World Economic Forum. These are exchange platforms where those who really have power and a lot of money can come together and establish a program, a strategy. Democratic control is needed here.- There is a concentration of power in a few hands, for example in asset managers such as BlackRock, whose budgets exceed the gross national product of entire countries. These are bodies without political control. They can decide autonomously.- The national parliaments and politicians are actually just shadowy figures of the donors in the background, who can no longer really make autonomous decisions.- Many images of the Apocalypse - such as animals with many heads and horns or the sign to buy and sell - play out before our eyes.- Ideologies - such as the gender ideology - are deconstructive. This not only affects the old social order, but also leads to the deconstruction of truth and reason. There is then no longer even a truth about human nature. Everything becomes the arbitrariness of feelings or interests. This can then be enforced by law.- Ideologies begin with the redefinition of language. The core of the matter is removed and only the shell is left. People talk about democracy, but there is no longer any democracy inside. You can say it's a democracy promotion law, but it's actually censorship. The protection of the narrative propagated by the state is referred to as the protection of democracy, as protection against fake news. That is the end of freedom of speech.- Theologians are the most refined sophists. And bishops have also mastered this art of speech, of saying something and nothing at the same time.- I started as an altar boy in the old rite and then retrained. I normally celebrate in the Novus Ordo. I am only now beginning to reflect on these things retrospectively: Why have these beautiful texts - such as the prayers at the Foot of the Altar or at the offertory - been canceled at the desk? These prayers also help the priest who is celebrating.- I learned the old rite because a priest from the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter asked me to do a confirmation. He has a very lively congregation with families and young people.- It is a time-honored liturgy that has been celebrated for almost 2000 years. We have around 24 rites in the Church. Why the marginalization or polemic of the faithful who love this rite?- I have wondered why the Second Vatican Council did not bring about a flowering of Faith. Paul VI already lamented this: Why was there not a renewal, but such a loss of Faith?- If you look at France, there were over 19,000 pilgrims on the pilgrimage from Paris to Chartres at Pentecost 2025 and the average age was 20. That's a generation that doesn't even know the texts of the Council. And I don't want to ask who among them has ever read an entire council text, for example Dei Verbum.- The old liturgy is very theocentric, Christocentric and the priest therefore has the central role. In the new liturgy, the danger is that the priest, who looks at the people, becomes almost like a moderator.- In the Novus Ordo, Christ's death on the cross, is overwritten by different themes. At First Communion, the rainbow is suddenly the theme. Or there is a crawling liturgy for toddlers, or a women's liturgy. The result is a workshop liturgy in which the essence is no longer recognizable. In the old Mass, the liturgical meaning is embodied in the form.

They can decide autonomously.- The national parliaments and politicians are actually just shadowy figures of the donors in the background, who can no longer really make autonomous decisions.- Many images of the Apocalypse - such as animals with many heads and horns or the sign to buy and sell - play out before our eyes.- Ideologies - such as the gender ideology - are deconstructive. This not only affects the old social order, but also leads to the deconstruction of truth and reason. There is then no longer even a truth about human nature. Everything becomes the arbitrariness of feelings or interests. This can then be enforced by law.- Ideologies begin with the redefinition of language. The core of the matter is removed and only the shell is left. People talk about democracy, but there is no longer any democracy inside. You can say it's a democracy promotion law, but it's actually censorship. The protection of the narrative propagated by the state is referred to as the protection of democracy, as protection against fake news. That is the end of freedom of speech.- Theologians are the most refined sophists. And bishops have also mastered this art of speech, of saying something and nothing at the same time.- I started as an altar boy in the old rite and then retrained. I normally celebrate in the Novus Ordo. I am only now beginning to reflect on these things retrospectively: Why have these beautiful texts - such as the prayers at the Foot of the Altar or at the offertory - been canceled at the desk? These prayers also help the priest who is celebrating.- I learned the old rite because a priest from the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter asked me to do a confirmation. He has a very lively congregation with families and young people.- It is a time-honored liturgy that has been celebrated for almost 2000 years. We have around 24 rites in the Church. Why the marginalization or polemic of the faithful who love this rite?- I have wondered why the Second Vatican Council did not bring about a flowering of Faith. Paul VI already lamented this: Why was there not a renewal, but such a loss of Faith?- If you look at France, there were over 19,000 pilgrims on the pilgrimage from Paris to Chartres at Pentecost 2025 and the average age was 20. That's a generation that doesn't even know the texts of the Council. And I don't want to ask who among them has ever read an entire council text, for example Dei Verbum.- The old liturgy is very theocentric, Christocentric and the priest therefore has the central role. In the new liturgy, the danger is that the priest, who looks at the people, becomes almost like a moderator.- In the Novus Ordo, Christ's death on the cross, is overwritten by different themes. At First Communion, the rainbow is suddenly the theme. Or there is a crawling liturgy for toddlers, or a women's liturgy. The result is a workshop liturgy in which the essence is no longer recognizable. In the old Mass, the liturgical meaning is embodied in the form. The Christian Latin mass was adapted from the older pagan Roman worship ceremonies. It’s quite ancient. You’re wrong. The Catholic Mass is no more more ancient than Jesus Christ’s Last Supper. I have no further intention of engaging with a liar who can’t even spell “altar”. Now that really is tendentious. Part one read scripture and preach. Part 2, reenact the Last Supper. Other parts are nearly as ancient. The Gloria, for example, dates to the 4th century The Byzantine Rite liturgy also involves a priest facing “liturgical east” and chanting prayers with his arms raised, so I’m not really sure what you’re trying to establish. Thanks for spurring me to search for the definition of tendentious. adj. 1. expressing or intending to promote a particular cause or point of view, especially a controversial one Example: a tendentious reading of history Animal sacrifice was part of Jewish temple practice. It is a central tenet of Christianity that Jesus’ sacrifice makes animal sacrifice obsolete. Roman practice has nothing to do with it. The Jews I know who have been to Mass were struck by how Jewish it is, such as in the call and response form of singing the Psalms. They did not connect anything in the Mass to paganism at all. (Btw, Remember folks we must pray for each other, especially when we are having contentious discussions.) If the Gospel account accurately describes a Seder, then it’s the former. The consecration is intended to reenact the Last Supper: On the day before he was to suffer, he took bread in his holy and venerable hands, and with eyes raised to heaven to you, O God, his almighty Father, giving you thanks, he said the blessing, broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying: Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my Body, which will be given up for you. In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took this precious chalice in his holy and venerable hands, and once more giving you thanks, he said the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying: Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my Blood, the Blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me. Jesus and the Apostles at the Last Supper were probably using the customary Greco-Roman posture for eating a banquet, which was to recline around a low table. Not sure how that could possibly work in a cathedral with 3000 people in attendance. The early Christians compared Christ and his coming to the rising of the sun. There's plenty of Biblical warrant for this, see Malachi 4:2, Matthew 24:27, etc. That's where "liturgical east" comes from, not from any kind of pagan syncretism.

There's plenty of Biblical warrant for this, see Malachi 4:2, Matthew 24:27, etc. That's where "liturgical east" comes from, not from any kind of pagan syncretism. Roman “animal sacrifice” wasn’t much like the Jewish model. They typically killed an animal and spread its entrails out as a fortune-telling method. Not sure why you think the Mass resembles that at all. Well you certainly don't seem to be doing that, are you? Do you know what a "hypocrite" is? Do you know what a "hypocrite" is? Intelligent people know the difference between “alter” and “altar”. Are you kidding? You think a church, headquartered in Rome and spread across Europe, the middle east, parts of Africa and Britain gave 2 licks what some German barbarians thought? You really need to do more research.

Share (FOX 9) - Allete, the parent company of Minnesota Power, says the Minnesota Department of Commerce is now backing the company's sale to investment firm BlackRock and the Canadian pension fund after a recent agreement. The backstory: Allete announced last year it had entered into an agreement to be acquired by a partnership between the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Global Infrastructure Partners, a division of BlackRock. Allete is the parent company of Minnesota Power, the electric company that serves parts of central and northeast Minnesota, including Duluth. Allete also owns Superior Light and Power in Wisconsin. What we know: In an announcement last week, Allete said it had reached an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce to gain support for the acquisition. Under the agreement, Allete says Minnesota Power would commit to a one-year base rate freeze and lower its return on equity from 9.78% to 9.65%. The agreement also requires: Dig deeper: Allete says the recent agreement follows another set of commitments made by the future owners, including honoring union contracts, maintaining the current workforce and compensation levels, keeping the company headquarters in Duluth, and retaining the current management team. The investment funds also agreed to contribute $3.5 million to forgive bills owed by low-income customers. What's next: The deal needs approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Allete expects to close on the deal in 2025. Other regulatory bodies, including the Wisconsin Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, have signed off on the deal.

Title: Bitcoin Bulls Target $120,000 — $1.5B Shorts on the Line

As Bitcoin’s all-time high (ATH) rollercoaster ride continues, the top cryptocurrency might be eyeing the psychological price of $120,000 based on the number of shorts expected to be liquidated at this level. Calling out this development, market analyst Crypto Joe stated, “$1.5 billion worth of BTC shorts are set to be liquidated if BTC hits $120,000.” What does this mean? Well, if Bitcoin hits $120,000, over $1.5 billion in short positions risk liquidation, forcing bearish traders to buy back at higher prices and potentially fueling further upside. Liquidations accelerate rallies because forced short closures trigger buybacks, adding buying pressure that drives Bitcoin’s price even higher. Based on the $1.5 billion worth of BTC shorts, the leading cryptocurrency might be eyeing strong bullish momentum because widespread short liquidations reveal misplaced bearish bets and set the stage for a powerful short squeeze. Bitcoin is not relenting on its quest to scale heights after recently hitting historic highs of $112,000, thanks to BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recording net inflows of $50 billion. The leading cryptocurrency’s present ATH stands at $118,351 per CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s breakout above $118,000 is being fueled by bullish macro trends, rising institutional demand, and strengthening on-chain fundamentals. The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs unlocked billions in institutional capital, with giants like BlackRock and Fidelity driving aggressive BTC accumulation with daily inflows now surpassing new supply. Institutional adoption for Bitcoin as a treasury asset is also going through the roof, further igniting BTC’s fire. Therefore, Bitcoin might continue making new ATHs, as evidenced by the huge liquidation expected at the $120,000, which is bullish based on technical analysis.

Title: With Markets At All-Time Highs, A First-Time Investor Hesitates. The Fear Of Buying At The Top Is Hard To Shake

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. A Reddit user recently opened up about a common fear many new investors face: buying into the stock market when prices are peaking. “I feel weird about starting investing when companies are in an all-time high,” wrote the poster, who said they’re ready to invest a lump sum this month but are second-guessing the timing. Today's Best Finance Deals The person, who isn’t currently invested outside of a 401(k), said they believe in the long-term potential of AI and tech companies. They’re not expecting massive short-term gains, but they do hope that “the current top companies with a combined market cap of 10T might be worth 2-3x more 20 years from now.” Don't Miss: Their hesitation comes at a time when the markets continue to break records. On July 10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed roughly 0.4% in a continuation of recent gains across major indexes. The S&P 500 inched up 0.3% to finish at a new record high of 6,280.46, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.1% to mark its second consecutive all-time high. AI chipmaker Nvidia NVDA closed slightly higher, ending the day just above a $4 trillion market cap, making it the first public company in history to surpass that milestone. The post triggered many responses from Reddit’s r/stocks community, most urging the user to stop overthinking and just start investing. “If you bought at the all time highs for each year, you wouldn’t be far from those who perfectly timed the bottoms,” one investor said, referencing data that shows time in the market typically beats trying to time the market. Another pointed out that the market is almost always at a high. “Zoom out, the market is usually near or at ATH,” they wrote. Trending: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly don't own yet. See which asset class has outpaced the S&P 500 (1995-2024) – and with near-zero correlation. Plenty of commenters acknowledged the fear of losing money right after a big buy. While many recognized that lump sum investing performs better most of the time, others recommended a slower approach known as dollar-cost averaging. “DCA isn't to get the most gains, it's to remove the possibility of buying a large sum and having it crash right after,” one person wrote. “It's like buying insurance.” Others were more straightforward. “There's always a reason not to buy,” one person said. “When you lose out on thousands years from now, not getting in, you'll regret it.” See Also: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now One Redditor shared their own anxiety-ridden journey as a new investor who inherited money from a parent: “Sometimes I feel like the more informed I am, the worse my returns have become.” There was also plenty of humor in the thread. “Just know that as soon as you buy, the market will crash. That’s the law of this subreddit,” joked one top comment. Despite the jokes and differing strategies, most commenters echoed the same long-term philosophy: invest early, stay consistent, and don't let fear paralyze you. As one put it, “You can buy at all time highs today or at all time highs five years from now. Your choice.” Read Next: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.

Title: Strap In, Vision Pro Owners

Time Published: 2025-07-13T18:05:15Z
Full Content:
Apple is apparently gearing up to launch an updated Vision Pro later this year, per Mark Gurman of Bloomberg. The big upgrade? Not the new chip, which will only be mildly useful without much content that can actually push the device, but instead a new head strap. I'm not kidding. They better be selling this thing separately for current Vision Pro owners and not forcing people to buy a new $3,500 paperweight or there will be riots in the streets. Well, amongst the few dozen Vision Pro owners in any given area. I kid, but I don't. Clearly such an update would simply be a message to the market that Apple isn't abandoning their plans in the face of slow sales and developer adoption. They're not ready to unveil a real upgrade yet – that will come in 2027 – but the spec bump and head strap is throwing the proverbial bone out there. Obviously – obviously – the first Vision Pro should have been released as a dev kit as I wrote 15 months ago. I know it would not have been very Apple-like to do that, but Apple needs to start doing some un-Apple-like things, IMO. They could have leaned on the messaging that this future piece of technology wasn't quite ready for prime time, but developers could get a glimpse of the future today if they're willing to pony up. And if a consumer really wants to try it, well, sign up for a developer account and have at it. That would have flipped the narrative entirely here. And honestly, I'm not sure the messaging would have been that much different from the way Steve Jobs used to call Apple TV a "hobby". All this new strap will do is further showcase how badly Apple messed up the ergonomics here. The fact that the Vision Pro shipped with two straps in the box already said all you needed to know. Now we'll apparently have a third option – after Apple implicitly endorsed other third-party options as well. The entire package is entirely too inconvenient for most people to even consider using on a regular basis. This better be one hell of a strap. This article is sort of framed oddly, suggesting that Amazon is "weighing another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic" when actually, we know from a 10-Q filing that they're due to invest "an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025". So I'm not sure what they're "weighing" here as this money was already committed in the form of convertible notes in different tranches. I suppose it's possible that they could have already invested the $2.7B between that filing (in May, for the quarter ended March) and now, but it's highly unlikely. So perhaps they're thinking about investing more on top of that commitment? Or maybe lines were just crossed and this reporting on that (already known) commitment. Regardless, one tidbit here is that the tech giants are capped "to keep them well below owning more than a third of Anthropic". Google currently owns 14% and my backtracking math has Amazon currently at 22.4% (before any new investment), so both have some room to grow if they want to put more money in (and undoubtedly insane valuations which will make growing their ownership stakes much from here difficult). One more wildcard: what if Apple were to invest? They pulled back from the OpenAI deal last year, but if they're really considering Claude as a Siri replacement/supplement... [FT 🔒] I was back on Alex Kantrowitz's Big Technology Podcast to talk about all of this and more. And notably, we talk through the Apple/Claude potential partnership for Siri and yes, if it could portend an Apple investment into Anthropic... the startup is undoubtedly too expensive for Apple to buy at this point – nor would Amazon (or Google) want/allow that, but Anthropic needs money. Apple has money. Sidenote: I'll be back on Big Technology Podcast on a monthly cadence going forward. You can find it on Spotify here or Apple Podcasts here. [YouTube] Look, Dune Messiah would have been a cooler name but it also perhaps signals Denis Villeneuve's intent not to stick to that particular book and to go beyond it. At the same time, he talks about how he doesn't view this as a trilogy because he considers the first two to really be one film – so it's weird to call this one "Part Three", unless you consider this to also be a part of one (now really) long film? At least no one is going to be confused like they may have been with another Anya Taylor-Joy movie, Furiosa ("A Mad Max Saga"). Also, note the fact that it won't be shot entirely with IMAX cameras (like Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey will for the first time in a feature film) but clearly a lot of it will be. By the time he's filming his Bond, might he be ready to go all-in on IMAX? (Probably not – but again, certainly a good chunk of it!) [Variety] Mark Gurman and Riley Griffin were able to pull a few more details about the package it took to lure Ruoming Pang from Apple to Meta. "More than $200M" over a few years, largely in stock tied to performance of Meta's own stock (and probably some other metrics). But yes, there are likely large "signing bonuses" involved in these deals depending on how much equity the talent would be walking away from. In Pang's case, that's obviously just Apple RSUs and not startup equity, but you can see how such cash payouts can rise quickly. It all sounds in the range of a 'Godfather' offer. "Apple didn’t try to match the offer..." Yeah I mean the only question is if their counter would have been off by two or three orders of magnitude. [Bloomberg 🔒] When the author wrote about the two companies racing one another to hit the milestone, I doubt he thought that NVIDIA would cross it in less than a week. Such is the state of AI exuberance. And while Microsoft has clearly ridden the wave as well – to the tune of their highest P/E ratio in 20 years – their risks and rewards are clearly less binary than they are with NVIDIA. They also have more levers to pull, which is what we may be seeing now with the layoffs even in a time of seeming strength as their revenue-per-employee is far below that of say, Google. Poor Apple, just literally not in this conversation right now. They very nearly hit $4T themselves last December, but now are nearly a full $1T behind their old friend/foe NVIDIA and a good $600B behind their old foe/foe Microsoft. The first company to hit $1T and $2T and $3T will likely be the 3rd to hit $4T – if they do at all (come on, they will, but it's rough out there right now!). All that said, if the AI market falters, NVIDIA and Microsoft are falling, fast. While Apple will likely be sitting pretty thanks to their inaction and ineptitude in AI. [WSJ 🔒] Right after Dia, Perplexity's Comet is here – with OpenAI inbound... To me, the biggest news about Linda Yaccarino stepping down as CEO of Xitter is that Xitter still had a CEO. I honestly thought that when they merged with xAI that whole charade sort of went away. Kudos on lasting two years, I guess. That is about double what anyone guessed. [Axios] Apparently and remarkably, this is unrelated to the latest Xitter xhitshow as she was telling people about her departure earlier in the week. [NYT] Might she land at Paramount post-Skydance merger when her old boss Jeff Shell takes over the President role?... [THR] OpenAI's first "open" model (weights, not source) could be here as soon as next week. And yes, it may add even more pressure to the Microsoft relationship – will it be on every cloud soon? [Verge] As expected, Mistral is in talks to raise up to $1B, likely from MGX and others. Another deal that will make it harder for Apple to make a deal if they wanted to this path (if they even could)... [Bloomberg 🔒] While there's no word on Mistral's valuation, SpaceX seems poised to hit $400B, which would put them close to ByteDance (pre-TikTok sale) in terms of highest private valuation. Well ahead of OpenAI. For now. [FT 🔒] It's not just Meta that is poaching from OpenAI, OpenAI is also poaching from Meta – but really, mainly Elon companies with talent from Tesla and xAI. I'm sure OpenAI was devastated to have this news leak via internal Slack messages. [Wired] We're getting a live-action Hot Wheels movie, thus moving us one step closer to the prophecy of the Kool-Aid Man busting through a brick wall on the silver screen. [Variety] In other computing headwear news, Meta has formalized their investment in EssilorLuxottica – $3.5B into the publicly-traded firm for a stake just under 3%, which they hope to bring up to 5%. Most importantly, this seemingly formalizes the fact that Google/Samsung/Apple/Snap/etc won't be working with their brands on any competing products... [Bloomberg 🔒] 'Max' is now officially 'HBO Max' again with app icons being updated around the world. No need to download a new app this time (which was another amazing moment of stupidity in all this). And now the countdown is officially on until they're 'HBO' again. [Verge] "I would expect Grok to discover new technologies that are actually useful no later than next year, and maybe end of this year. It might discover new physics next year… Let that sink in." – Elon Musk, talking a big game (obviously as usual) with the release of Grok 4. Can xAI back up these claims better than Meta was able to back up Mark Zuckerberg's big claims about Llama 4? Or will Elon be next to step in with $500M pay packages and 'Godfather' offers? (The early results seem promising for Grok 4 – but they also did for Llama 4! You can try it out yourself for the low-low price of $300/month.) In July 2015, 10 years ago, NVIDIA's market cap was $10B. Yesterday, it hit $4T. No posts Ready for more?

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Gartner rates privately-held Algolia ahead of Google in the $56 billion market for search and product discovery. With Alphabet stock down this year, investors should be worried. GERMANY - 2024/09/21: In this photo illustration, a mobile phone with the website of ai search ... More engine company Algolia Inc. is seen in front of business logo. (Photo Illustration by Timon Schneider/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The market for digital commerce search reached $56.5 billion in 2024 and is forecast to grow at a 12.6% compound annual rate to $185.7 billion in 2033, reports Data Horizon Research. Algolia’s customer base has grown at a 21% average annual rate to 18,000, according to my July 10 interview with Algolia CEO Bernadette Nixon. Google — shares of which have lost 5% of their value in 2025 — is confident in the strength of its product discovery search service, according to a Google company release. Gartner rates privately-held San Francisco-based Algolia ahead of Google. Google’s spent $2.4 billion to license Windsurf AI coding technology, reported CNBC. That unlikely to be enough for Google to surpass Algolia — or faster-growing AI rivals such as ChatGPT and Perplexity. Google shares have lost value in 2025. That’s because the search giant — which developed the core Transformer model for predicting the next word based on its context underlying generative AI, according to my book, Brain Rush — is struggling to catch up with ChatGPT and others when it comes to commercializing its idea. Is the drop in Google stock a buying opportunity? The answer depends on whether Google can keep its search business relevant. “The market will need to see fundamental evidence that Google search is indeed going to be more durable than currently appreciated,” Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a report featured by Investor’s Business Daily. If rivals such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Meta AI better deploy generative AI to cash in on advertising and improved e-commerce and travel verticals, Google’s stock could keep dropping, noted Nowak. For Google bulls, I have bad news: Algolia — which says it is deploying agentic AI for brands — is ahead of Google in those two search and product discovery verticals. In 2018, I was surprised to learn Google had abandoned the business of helping consumers search through a company's online product catalog, according to my October 2018 Forbes post. Google was good at bringing users to a website but once there, customers relied on the websites’ own search functions to find products. Some companies "build their own engines; others use open-source software, such as Elasticsearch,” the Economist reported. At the time, Algolia — founded in Paris in 2012 — was rapidly taking a piece of that pie by supplying a service that "hunts the client’s website and swiftly offers consumers relevant results," added the Economist. Since then, Google has entered this market and this year was deemed a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for vision and ability to execute. However, within that elite group of leaders, Algolia is the top dog. Read on for why this market is significant and why I do not think Google is doing enough to overtake Algolia and larger rivals in monetizing AI. I requested comment from Google and will update this post if I receive a reply. While analysts use many ways to describe the digital commerce search industry, they agree the industry is growing fast and will become far larger in the next decade. The industry’s goal is to understand consumers’ needs and recommend products that best satisfy those needs. AI is the most significant growth propellent for this business in year — it enhances consumer experiences, increase sales, and boosts engagement, according to SuperAGI. AI-driven recommendation engines can increase customer loyalty, average order size and the lifetime value of a customer. For example, 71% of consumers are more likely to return to a website offering personalized experiences. Moreover, such systems suggest complementary products — thereby increasing average order value by 10% to 15%, reported SuperAGI. Algolia appears to be riding this growth wave. The company provides an AI-native search and discovery platform to enable brands such as PetSmart, Best Buy, Chewy, Twitch, Stripe, and Under Armour to deliver fast, relevant, and personalized search experiences, according to an Algolia release. Algolia’s search-as-a-service solution uses AI recommendations, NeuralSearch, and real-time personalization to boosts user engagement and increase conversion rates, the release added. Algolia has added many customers in the last five years. “When I joined Algolia we had less than 7,000 customers, now we have 18,000,” Nixon — who joined the company in 2020 — told me. “We process two billion transactions per year and have millions of developers on our platform.” Algolia’s growth can be attributed to its ability to satisfy e-commerce search customers’ need for reliable performance at scale. “We provide five nine’s reliability which means only 26 seconds of downtime per month,” she said. “Reliability is really important and it is difficult to do when operating at scale.” Algolia has repeatedly introduced meaningful innovations. “We disrupted the market three times and we are about to do it a fourth,” Nixon explained. Instead of relying on preexisting search software such as Lucene, Algolia’s search was built from scratch to work on mobile. Next, the company introduced search as a service and charged customers based on the number of searches — with the price per search declining with the number of searches. Finally, in 2023, Algolia introduced hybrid search — “combining keyword and natural language search incorporating large language models,” she told me. Algolia is most excited about agentic AI — which will enable consumers to take action towards a goal. The company uses Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol — which allows AI agents to access Algolia's search, analytics, recommendations, and index configuration APIs. “AI agents must be able to work across walled gardens to traverse a company’s back-end seamlessly to retrieve data,” she said. “To that end, we have partnered with Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Adobe Experience Manager.” Algolia’s customers are benefiting from how much consumers’ use of ChatGPT to search for products is adding to web traffic. “Adobe Analytics has found generative AI is giving retailers and banks 1,200% traffic increases while travel sites are seeing 1,700% increases,” she told me. “When people come to a retailer’s site they bounce 23% less frequently and look at 12% more pages per visit.” Algolia also provides personalized digital shopping guides — say, for Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day — targeted towards various lifestyles. “In beta test, we have 73 shopping guides already,” she concluded. Google's offerings — notably Google Ads and Vertex AI Search for Commerce — can boost retailer revenues in three ways: In July 2025, Gartner ranked Google and Algolia as Magic Quadrant for Search and Product Discovery leaders based on their completeness of vision and ability to execute. Algolia is the leader among leaders — prevailing over Google. Algolia is proud of Gartner’s recognition. “This is the second year we have been a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Search and Product Discovery,” Nixon told me. “We are up and to the right in the leader box which makes us the best in the industry for completeness of vision and ability to execute. How? We want to make search easy for the masses. We wanted to be scalable in the enterprise. We solve the search puzzle for the masses.” Google was happy to be an MQ leader. “We believe this recognition affirms Google’s evolving commitment to delivering high ROI-generating product discovery, through the use of AI in relevance, ranking, and personalization,” noted Google Cloud AI Director, Product Management Sachin Padwal in a July 8 company release. Algolia is ahead of Google in applying agentic AI for search and product discovery. While Google has not yet launched such a service, on July 11 the search giant acquired executive talent and intellectual property from Windsurf — a leader in agentic AI, noted CNBC. Algolia’s MCP Server — launched in June 2025 — enables LLMs and autonomous agents to work together to help consumers buy what they need more quickly. For example, Algolia’s agentic AI service can help consumers book a Mediterranean cruise. By retrieving relevant consumer information from platforms such as Adobe and Salesforce. For example, Algolia agentic AI service can recommend and book a cruise based on each guest’s chosen destinations, travel history, and other preferences — in milliseconds, according to a company release. “This isn’t about showing off what agents could do,” Nixon said. “It’s about showing what they can do right now with a powerful user experience, if they have the right layer of intelligence underneath. That’s where Algolia fits.” Meanwhile, Google is currently experimenting with agentic AI for travel. Google’s “AI Mode” will be able to “plan full itineraries, remember context, and keep users within the AI interface — even for booking,” noted Hospitality.today. “Google’s Project Mariner” will enable “AI to take actions online -- like booking a hotel or tracking flight prices.” Google stock is 12% undervalued based on the average price target of 37 Wall Street analysts, according to TipRank. If Algolia’s lead over Google in search and product discovery is any indication, those analysts could be too optimistic.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season Preview

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. The second-quarter earnings season begins this week, with 39 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. ... More This week has a heavy emphasis on banks including: JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) (AP Photo/File) The second-quarter earnings season begins this week. 39 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report, with a heavy emphasis on the large banks. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Blackrock (BLK), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Goldman Sachs (GS), PepsiCo (PEP), Netflix (NFLX), 3M (MMM), and American Express (AXP). With only a few companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 4.8% year-over-year, slightly below the expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the calendar year 2025 expected earnings growth rate is 9.0% and 2026’s expectations are at 14.0%. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Tariff worries led to a slight decline in the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Market Performance Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth, a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, and are currently in a bear market, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. The first of the Magnificent 7 is scheduled to report results next week. Magnificent 7: Q2 Estimated Earnings Growth According to FactSet data, the earnings expectations for the financial sector are deceptively low due to JPMorgan Chase (JPM). JPM reported a significant gain from sales of Visa (V) stock in the same quarter last year, so the company has challenging year-over-year comparisons. If JPM is excluded from the financial sector, year-over-year earnings growth improves to 9.3% from 2.4%. Earnings Growth Estimates By Sector On the other side of the ledger, earnings growth rate expectations within the communication services sector are being flattered by Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). According to FactSet, WBD reported a significant loss last year due to a goodwill impairment charge, so it is benefiting from extremely easy comparisons. If WBD is excluded, the expected growth of the communication services sector falls from 29.4% year-over-year to 8.2%. The energy sector is predicted to show the most significant decline in year-over-year earnings due to lower oil prices. Energy Commodities Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the estimates of second quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth of 4.7% are correct, there could be some upside to sales growth. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.2% is meeting expectations. GDP Growth Fuels S&P 500 Sales Consistent with the earnings picture, revenues in the energy sector should see the most significant year-over-year decline. Estimated Sales Growth By Sector The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter last year. On the margin, this should benefit companies’ international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. US Dollar The economic calendar also heats up this week with consumer inflation (CPI) and retail sales. Tuesday’s June CPI is expected to be hotter, increasing to 2.6% year-over-year from 2.4%. The Federal Reserve already expects some inflation impact from tariffs and is likely on the sidelines until at least September. The retail sales report on Thursday is expected to show a modest rebound for the US consumer. Since consumers are a crucial driver of the US economy, this rebound will be essential for economic growth expectations. Newsflow about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. Significant new tariffs are currently scheduled to be implemented on August 1, barring an acceptable trade agreement. With financials dominating the first week of earnings season, the headline earnings should begin on a positive note. With the tariff overhang and consensus expecting an acceleration in earnings growth for the third quarter, forward earnings guidance from management will be watched closely.

Title: Wall Street’s Deepest Values: 5 Cheap CEFs Yielding 7%+
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/07/13/wall-streets-deepest-values-5-cheap-cefs-yielding-7/
Time Published: 2025-07-13T11:45:00Z

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Travel Destination The last bargains on the big board? Discounted closed-end funds (CEFs). CEFs are often the “last stop” for dividend deals. We are talking about an inefficient corner of the income universe, which is just great for us contrarians—we love the discounts. And these funds can trade for less than “fair value” for months and even years on end. When the markets washed out in April, these CEFs were discarded by their vanilla dividend owners. Let’s pick up the pieces for up to 12% off, or 88 cents on the dollar. And in the process secure yields up to 9.7%. Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX)Distribution Rate: 8.4% We’ll start with the Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), an example of a strategy that thrives in CEF land: covered calls. DIAX’s five fund managers attempt to replicate the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but with less volatility, by owning the DJIA’s components while also selling call options on between 35% and 75% of the notional value of the equity portfolio. Covered-call funds generally offer the exact same tradeoff: Receive lower volatility and a higher percentage of returns coming from distributions in exchange for lesser overall performance than the underlying index (because DIAX’s holdings are being “called away” as they rise). Unfortunately, in the case of DIAX, the underperformance is stark, even when considering a distribution rate that’s more than 5x the Dow’s dividend yield. We’re generally better off buying funds like DIAX when we think the Dow is toppy. The fund trades at an 11% discount as I write, more than its recent average of 9%. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 8.3% Numerous CEFs turn income-unfriendly segments of the market into distribution funnels. Take the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG), which generates an 8%-plus monthly payout from a few dozen technology, communications, and consumer stocks. While thematic ETFs are a dime a dozen, thematic CEFs like NBXG are few and far between. This Neuberger fund’s theme is next-generation connectivity; managers Hari Ramanan, Yan Taw Boon, and Timothy Creedom seek out stocks that “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But if we take a quick look, it’s pretty apparent NBXG can also stand in as a play on artificial intelligence (AI). Mag 7 holdings such as Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are pretty direct plays on AI at this point. The fund even invests in private companies, such as AI-powered Grammarly. It also engages in options trading to generate gains from options premiums and tamp down on risk. Neuberger’s CEF has trailed the tech sector since inception, though that’s not a terribly fair comparison given its exposure to other sectors. Still, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past 18 months or so: The fund’s discount to NAV is generous, at 11.2% currently, so we have NBXG’s assets selling for 89 cents on the dollar..) Royce Micro-Cap Trust (RMT)Distribution Rate: 7.5% Another place we might not expect a high-single-digit yield? Small-cap stocks. But that’s exactly what we get from Royce Micro-Cap Trust (RMT). RMT—managed by Jim Stoeffel and Andrew Palen—is a micro-cap value fund in name, though given an average market cap of about $750 million, it’s truly closer to small-cap in nature. Still, not exactly a who’s who of ballyhooed dividend names. Holdings include the likes of electronic component maker Bel Fuse (BELFA), which pays a fractional yield, and online advertising firm Magnite (MGNI), which pays no dividend whatsoever. So, what’s with the big distribution? RMT doesn’t really trade options, nor does it use debt leverage. Instead, it’s just a quarterly distribution of predominantly long-term capital gains. Not ideal, but RMT pulls it off. I’ve previously pointed out that RMT always trades at a discount, and indeed, it’s trading right around its five-year average discount to NAV (12%). That’s not exactly a good thing—ideally, management should have a plan to close that discount at some point. But it’s hard to knock Royce too much given RMT’s consistent outperformance. Virtus Total Return Fund (ZTR)Distribution Rate: 9.7% Virtus Total Return Fund (ZTR) is a “portfolio in a can,” capable of investing in stocks and a wide array of bonds and other fixed income, both domestically and internationally. ZTR’s four-manager team has currently built a 75/25 stock/bond portfolio. The equity sleeve is both lopsided and defensive in nature; half of its weight is in utilities, while the rest is largely taken up by industrials and energy firms. On the debt side, ZTR owns investment-grade and junk corporates, emerging-market bonds, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, bank loans, Treasuries, and more. Like many closed-end funds (but unlike the CEFs above), ZTR amplifies its bets through debt; it currently has 130% of assets invested thanks to debt leverage. Virtus Total Return is considered a “moderate allocation” fund, which refers to funds that typically have between 50% and 70% of their assets invested in stocks (with the rest in bonds and/or cash). While this CEF currently has a 75/25 blend, I’ve seen it as low as 60/40 when looking at it in the past. Still, for comparison’s sake, it’s worth looking at ZTR against a couple different allocation benchmarks—in this case, a 60/40 ETF and a more aggressive 80/20 ETF. Virtus’ fund has enjoyed pockets of outperformance in the past, but the fund has lost an enormous amount of ground recently. Its dips have been harsher than the plain-vanilla ETFs, which is normal for a leveraged CEF, but its recoveries have been more muted—the opposite of what we’d expect. Unfortunately, that blunts the appeal of ZTR’s nearly 10% distribution (paid monthly), as well as a roughly 11% discount to NAV that’s cheaper than its five-year average (8%). Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (CHW)Distribution Rate: 8.4% Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (CHW) is a global fund that can invest not just in common stock, but investment-grade corporates, junk corporates, preferred stock, bank loans, convertible debt, asset-backed securities, US government securities, options, and more. At the moment, about two-thirds of assets are invested in common stock, with another 15% in convertibles, 10% in corporate debt, and the rest scattered around the other categories. Geographically speaking, the US accounts for a little more than half of the fund’s assets, with the rest in developed markets like Germany, Japan, and Canada, as well as emerging markets like China and India. On top of all of that, CHW’s five-manager team also utilizes a hefty amount of debt leverage: just south of 30% currently. There aren’t many global allocation funds out there, and those that are simply aren’t built the way CHW is—especially given that management has a long leash and a lot of assets they can explore.

Title: What it takes to be a thriving Amazon seller making seven figures

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we spotlight some of our top stories and bring you behind the scenes of our newsroom. This week, we put a big question to BI readers: Can millennial dads really have it all? Many fathers told us they're feeling burned out trying to excel at work and be fully present at home. I get it. As a dad of two young kids, I do my best to be an active, present, and equal parenting partner. But I also see, every day, just how much of the heavy lifting my wife does. What's your take on the millennial dad paradox? Is true balance possible—or just a myth we're still chasing? We'd love to hear from you. On the agenda today: But first: Side hustle tips from the pros. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Kathleen Elkins is the kind of journalist who preaches what she covers. She's been writing for years about real estate investing, e-commerce entrepreneurs, and side hustles. She has taken this coverage and put it to practical use: Last year, she started her own business selling pickleball paddles online. Kathleen recently profiled an exclusive group of Amazon sellers making seven figures in annual revenue. (No, she's not a member — maybe one day!) I sat down with Kathleen to learn more about these entrepreneurs and how they achieved their success. How did you find out about this niche community of thriving Amazon sellers? A previous source who I keep in touch with is super ingrained in the Amazon seller community and suggested I talk to one of the cofounders of Million Dollar Sellers. She put us in touch, we set up an intro call, and I pretty immediately knew that I wanted to proceed with a story about the community and how one gets into the exclusive club. What is it like to be a member of this club? How does one get into it, and what are the benefits? The cofounder I spoke to, Eugene Khayman, told me the two biggest perks of being a member are the Facebook Group and the events. He likened them to "a family reunion, where you're actually excited to see everybody there." He knows how difficult and lonely it can feel at times to sell to faceless customers, and the in-person events help him get fired up and gain positive momentum. What did you learn from these e-commerce sellers that might help you in your own side hustle? After writing about e-commerce entrepreneurs for years, I decided to give it a go myself, mostly out of curiosity: Can anyone — including a journalist with some savings and a couple of free hours after work — make money selling things online? What does it really take? Turns out, a lot of time and effort. Starting a business, even as a side project, is all-consuming. I'll leave you with two takeaways: One, I'm going to have to spend money on Amazon ads. Two, keep talking to people in the e-commerce space who know what they're doing and get curious. As Eugene told me, "It's all about putting yourself in a room with people that are smarter than you." For months, mass DOGE layoffs were stalled as a legal battle between the White House and advocacy groups played out. That all changed Tuesday, when the Supreme Court announced it wouldn't stand in the way of the Trump administration. BI spoke to 16 employees at federal agencies to gauge the reaction. Most used words like "fear," "uncertainty," "disheartening," and "bleak" to describe the mood within their agencies. Some expressed concern about their livelihoods and financial security, as well as the future of public service. "I can't see any of this ending well." Also read: When the Sequoia Capital partner called NYC mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani an "Islamist," it made national news and prompted two open letters. Instead of an apology or deleted tweet, however, Maguire only doubled down on his comments. The saga might just mark a new era in a post-pandemic tech ecosystem. Top investors have learned they can be loud, bold, and polarizing, and it won't impact their ability to secure deals. The venture capital "fame game." Also read: Though the financial industry isn't the obvious target of Trump's immigration crackdown, its effects are still being felt across hiring, travel, and dealmaking. Lawyers, executives, and business leaders told BI how Trump's border policy is changing their daily lives, from amending the language they use at the border to scrutinizing immigration compliance in M&A deals. Wall Street as a border town. The search and cloud giant keeps salary data confidential. However, publicly available work visa data filed with the US Labor Department offers a glimpse of how much it pays certain roles. Google has hired thousands of software engineers through this process. The data shows they can command salaries as high as $340,000 before equity and bonuses. See how much key roles make. This week's quote: "She always made it clear she would walk away when the time was right. She made enough money that she doesn't need to work." — Linda Yaccarino's friend on Yaccarino leaving her CEO role at X. More of this week's top reads: Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino couldn't turn Elon Musk's business around — because of Elon Musk. The BI Today team: Steve Russolillo, chief news editor, in New York.

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648. NEW YORK, July 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Proof Of Power: Bitcoin Dwarfs S&P 500 With Nearly 100% Edge Since 2012—Data

Bitcoin is flexing its muscle. The S&P 500 Index closed at 6,280 on July 10, 2025, marking a 6% year‑to‑date gain in dollar terms. The benchmark even set fresh records this week. Yet priced in Bitcoin, that same index sits about 15% lower so far this year. That gap shows just how strong crypto’s rally has been. According to market analyst The Kobeissi Letter, measuring the S&P 500 against BTC highlights a dramatic shift. Since 2012, the index has fallen almost a whopping 100% versus Bitcoin, based on data from Bitbo. Investors who stuck with Bitcoin instead of stocks over the past decade would be sitting on massive gains. That contrast has become impossible to ignore. Truly incredible: The S&P 500 in Bitcoin terms is now DOWN -15% year-to-date. Since 2012, the S&P 500 in Bitcoin terms is down -99.98%. We are all witnessing history. https://t.co/DsoHhJQXvo pic.twitter.com/UHETngTqGy — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 11, 2025 Based on figures from CoinMarketCap, BTC pushed past $118,800, Friday. The digital asset climbed 6% in the previous 24 hours and gained 10% over the past week. Overall, BTC is up 26% in 2025. Those numbers have drawn fresh attention from traders who once treated crypto as a fringe bet. In 2025, money has flooded into crypto via exchange‑traded funds in the US. As of this week, the 12 US spot Bitcoin ETFs hold a combined 1.26 million BTC—about $148 billion at current prices. That stash represents over 6% of all Bitcoin in circulation, according to Bitbo data. Inflows into digital asset ETFs landed them as the third‑largest fund category in the first half of the year, trailing only short‑term government debt and gold, State Street data shows. On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their second‑largest single‑day inflow ever, pulling in over $1 billion. Traders view these ETFs as a simpler way to tap into BTC gains without dealing directly with wallets or exchanges. At the time of writing, Coingecko data shows BTC trading at $118,038—still holding most of its recent upside.

Analyst Charlie Bilello has pointed out that BTC has climbed far more than big tech names like Nvidia, Tesla, and Netflix over the past decade. That wider outperformance has added fuel to the argument that digital currency belongs in major portfolios. With US equities near record highs in greenbacks but lagging in Bitcoin terms, some investors are weighing how to balance their bets. The rush into spot ETFs speaks to a growing belief that crypto deserve a spot alongside stocks and bonds.

Boutique investment bank KBW believes JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are primed to witness higher prices as conditions conspire to favor large US banks In a new interview on CNBC Television, KBW head of US bank research Chris McGratty says the firm has upgraded its ratings for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley to outperform, with price targets of $327 for JPM and $160 for MS. According to McGratty, large banks are poised to benefit from easing regulations due to their scale-driven efficiency and consistent performance. “You are seeing a re-rating. This re-rating has been occurring for the past couple of months. Deregulation is being built into earnings estimate upside scenarios, blue skies, and the reality is that the upside scenario is becoming the base-case scenario. So you’re seeing the universal, the largest six banks, lead the charge. We’ve gotten a lot of positive news on deregulation, and that’s one of three themes with this launch is deregulation. The other two themes are scale and consistency, and any way you check it, the largest banks have all three under the relative winners.” As of Friday’s close, JPM is trading at $286 and MS is worth $142. Another banking giant on McGratty’s radar is Citi (C). McGratty says Citi may be the most undervalued stock among the group based on its return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), a financial metric that measures how efficiently a bank is generating profits for its common shareholders. “If you think about their guide, their 10-11% ROTCE guide for next year, they took that down earlier this year. So the bar has been lowered. But if you look at where expectations are, we’re in the low to mid-9%. So there’s a big gap between low 9% and 10 to 11%. So if they can get that right, it’s the cheapest stock in the group. They’ve got a buyback catalyst. It’s very accretive when you can buy your stock back below 10 to a book value. And so this deregulatory environment for Citi is hugely helpful. The reason the ROE (return on equity) is so low is that the expenses have had to play catch-up. That investment phase is done, and so what the company is doing now is they are generating revenue. They are generating positive operating leverage across their businesses, and if they can get the macro to settle in a bit, this is a company I think we can re-rate quite a bit.” KBW is a New York-based firm known for its deep expertise in financials and bank stock coverage.

Title: VTI Vs. VOO: Comparing The Risk And Resilience Of These ETFs In A Volatile Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/vti-vs-voo-comparing-risk-resilience-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-07-12T16:00:00Z

ByJason Kirsch ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. VTI and VOO both offer excellent low-cost access to U.S. equity markets, but their different ... More approaches create distinct risk and return profiles. When it comes to broad market exposure through exchange-traded funds, two Vanguard offerings consistently dominate investor conversations: VTI and VOO. Both funds have garnered massive followings among retail and institutional investors alike, yet they represent fundamentally different approaches to capturing U.S. equity market returns. While both ETFs offer low-cost access to American stocks, their structural differences create distinct risk profiles that become particularly pronounced during periods of market volatility. Understanding how these two popular funds respond to market turbulence requires examining their underlying compositions, diversification strategies, and historical performance patterns. This analysis will examine the nuanced differences between VTI's total market approach and VOO's S&P 500 focus, enabling investors to determine which fund better aligns with their risk tolerance and investment objectives during uncertain market conditions. Before diving into risk analysis and volatility comparisons, it's essential to understand the core characteristics that define each fund. While both VTI and VOO are Vanguard products that track U.S. equity markets, their methodologies and scopes differ significantly, creating unique investment profiles that appeal to different investor preferences and market outlooks. VTI seeks to track the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, representing nearly 100% of the investable U.S. stock market across all capitalization segments. Launched on May 31, 2001, this fund has grown to become one of the largest ETFs globally, with net assets exceeding $1.81 trillion. The fund employs a sampling strategy to closely match its benchmark index, which includes large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks across all sectors of the American economy. The fund's broad mandate means it holds thousands of individual securities, with its top 10 holdings representing just 26.5% of total assets. Apple leads at 5.58%, followed by Microsoft at 4.93%, demonstrating how even the most prominent companies maintain relatively modest weightings within the total market context. This diversification extends across sectors, with technology commanding the largest allocation at 23.78%, followed by healthcare at 14.10% and financial services at 13.54%. VOO tracks the S&P 500 Index, focusing exclusively on the 500 largest publicly traded U.S. companies by market capitalization. Launched on September 9, 2010, this fund has accumulated approximately $1.4 trillion in net assets, making it one of the most popular large-cap equity investments available. The fund's benchmark represents roughly 80% of the total U.S. stock market by value, concentrating on established, profitable companies that meet specific criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500. The fund's top 10 holdings carry more weight than VTI's, representing 30.78% of total assets. Apple dominates with a 6.57% allocation, followed by Microsoft at 5.80%. This higher concentration reflects the market-cap weighted nature of the S&P 500, where the most prominent companies naturally command greater influence over fund performance. Sector allocation mirrors VTI's general distribution but with slight variations, including technology at 24.46% and healthcare at 14.48%. The most significant difference between these funds lies in their market capitalization exposure breadth. VTI includes small- and mid-cap stocks that VOO excludes, providing exposure to approximately 4,000 securities compared to VOO's 500. This broader scope means VTI captures the entire spectrum of U.S. public companies, from micro-cap startups to mega-cap giants, while VOO focuses exclusively on large-cap established enterprises. Weighting methodologies also create subtle but important distinctions. While both funds use market-cap weighting, VTI's inclusion of smaller companies means large-cap stocks have slightly less influence on overall performance compared to VOO. This difference becomes particularly relevant during periods when small- and mid-cap stocks outperform or underperform their large-cap counterparts, creating performance divergence between the two funds despite their substantial overlap in holdings. Examining how VTI and VOO respond to market volatility requires analyzing multiple risk dimensions, from historical price movements to sector concentration effects. While both funds track U.S. equity markets and share similar long-term return profiles, their different approaches to market exposure create distinct risk characteristics that become apparent during periods of market stress and uncertainty. Historical analysis reveals subtle but meaningful differences in how these funds handle market turbulence. VTI's broader market exposure typically results in slightly higher volatility compared to VOO, particularly during periods when small- and mid-cap stocks experience heightened price swings. Over the past decade, VTI has demonstrated a marginally higher standard deviation in monthly returns, reflecting the additional volatility contributed by its exposure to smaller companies. Risk-adjusted returns, as measured by metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, indicate that both funds perform similarly over extended periods. However, VTI occasionally edges ahead during market cycles that favor smaller companies. The fund's 10-year annualized return of 13.0% compares to VOO's 13.7%, reflecting periods where large-cap stocks outperformed; however, these differences often reverse during different market cycles. Beta measurements relative to the broader market indicate that VTI typically exhibits slightly higher market sensitivity due to its small-cap component. Both funds face similar sector concentration risks, with technology representing their largest allocation. However, subtle differences in sector weightings create varying exposure to sector-specific volatility. VOO's slightly higher technology weighting at 24.46% compared to VTI's 23.78% means greater sensitivity to technology sector movements, which can amplify both gains and losses during tech-focused market cycles. Diversification benefits emerge more clearly when examining VTI's broader sector representation. The fund's inclusion of smaller companies provides access to niche sectors and subsectors that may not be represented in the S&P 500, potentially offering some protection against concentrated sector downturns. This broader exposure can help cushion portfolio performance when specific, large-cap-dominated sectors experience significant declines; however, it also means exposure to potentially more volatile, smaller-company sectors. The most significant risk differential between these funds stems from their market capitalization exposure profiles. VTI's inclusion of small- and mid-cap stocks introduces additional volatility, as these companies tend to experience more pronounced price swings during market stress periods. Small-cap stocks often face greater liquidity constraints during market downturns, potentially amplifying losses compared to their large-cap counterparts. Conversely, VOO's focus on large-cap stocks provides inherent stability advantages during turbulent periods. Large companies typically possess stronger balance sheets, more diversified revenue streams, and better access to capital markets, helping them weather economic storms more effectively. This stability comes at the cost of potentially missing upside opportunities when smaller companies outperform, but it provides more predictable performance during uncertain market conditions. The diversification strategies employed by VTI and VOO represent different philosophies toward risk management and return optimization. While both funds offer broad U.S. market exposure, their approaches to diversification create distinct advantages and limitations that investors must consider when building portfolios designed to weather various market conditions. VTI's comprehensive market coverage provides several diversification benefits that can enhance portfolio resilience during specific market conditions. The fund's exposure to mid- and small-cap stocks offers access to companies in earlier growth stages, potentially capturing value creation that occurs before companies reach S&P 500 inclusion criteria. This broader exposure means investors participate in the full spectrum of American business success stories, from emerging growth companies to established market leaders. The fund's reduced single-stock risk represents another significant advantage. With thousands of holdings compared to VOO's 500, VTI provides greater protection against individual company failures or sector-specific downturns. This diversification becomes particularly valuable during periods of market rotation, when different segments of the market experience varying performance patterns. The fund's structure also means that no single company or small group of companies can disproportionately impact overall performance, providing more balanced exposure to market movements. VOO's concentration on S&P 500 companies offers distinct advantages through its bias toward quality, established enterprises. These companies have demonstrated sustained profitability, met specific financial criteria, and possess the scale necessary to compete effectively in their respective markets. This quality focus can provide more predictable performance patterns and reduced volatility compared to broader market exposure that includes smaller, potentially less stable companies. The fund's lower exposure to small-cap volatility represents a significant benefit for risk-averse investors. Small companies often experience more dramatic price swings due to limited liquidity, higher business risk, and greater sensitivity to economic cycles. By excluding these companies, VOO provides smoother performance patterns that may be more suitable for investors seeking steady, predictable returns without the additional volatility associated with smaller company exposure. The choice between VTI's broad diversification and VOO's focused approach involves important trade-offs that depend on market conditions and investor objectives. VTI's broader exposure can provide superior returns during periods when small- and mid-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks, but this same exposure can amplify losses when smaller companies underperform. Historical analysis shows these performance cycles can persist for extended periods, making timing considerations important for investors choosing between these approaches. VOO's focused strategy offers more predictable performance but potentially sacrifices upside opportunities available in the broader market. During periods of economic expansion when smaller companies benefit from growth opportunities, VOO investors may miss significant returns available through broader market exposure. However, during economic contractions or periods of market stress, VOO's large-cap focus often provides better downside protection, making it potentially more suitable for conservative investors or those approaching retirement. Dividend income represents an essential component of total returns for both VTI and VOO, though their different market exposures create subtle variations in yield characteristics and dividend sustainability. Understanding these differences helps investors evaluate which fund better aligns with their income generation objectives and risk tolerance regarding dividend payments. Both funds currently offer similar dividend yields of approximately 1.2%, reflecting the overall yield characteristics of the U.S. stock market. However, the composition of these yields differs due to their distinct market exposures. VOO's focus on large-cap stocks typically provides more consistent dividend payments, as larger companies often maintain more established dividend policies and possess greater financial resources to sustain payments during challenging periods. VTI's broader market exposure encompasses companies across the dividend spectrum, ranging from high-yielding, mature companies to growth-oriented firms that pay minimal or no dividends. This diversity can create more variable dividend income over time, as the fund's yield may fluctuate based on the relative performance and dividend policies of different market segments. Historical analysis reveals that both funds maintain relatively stable yields over extended periods, although VTI occasionally experiences slightly more yield volatility due to its broader company exposure. The dividend growth characteristics of both funds reflect the policies of their underlying holdings. Large-cap companies in VOO often demonstrate more predictable dividend growth patterns, with many maintaining consistent annual increases over extended periods. VTI's dividend growth may be less predictable due to its inclusion of smaller companies that may initiate, suspend, or dramatically alter dividend payments based on business conditions and growth opportunities. Dividend sustainability analysis reveals important differences between these funds' income generation capabilities. VOO's concentration on S&P 500 companies provides exposure to dividends from financially stable, profitable enterprises with established track records of maintaining payments through various economic cycles. These companies typically possess diversified revenue streams, strong balance sheets, and access to capital markets that support dividend continuity even during challenging periods. VTI's broader exposure includes companies with varying dividend sustainability profiles. While the fund benefits from the same large-cap dividend payers as VOO, it also includes smaller companies that may have less predictable dividend policies. Some smaller companies may offer higher yields but face greater risk of dividend cuts during economic downturns, while others may pay no dividends at all, focusing instead on growth investments. Sector exposure impacts dividend reliability differently for each fund. VOO's slightly higher weighting in technology stocks, which traditionally pay lower dividends, may result in lower overall yield but potentially higher dividend growth as these companies mature. VTI's broader sector exposure includes more traditional dividend-paying sectors but also encompasses growth-oriented sectors where dividend payments may be less prioritized, creating a more complex dividend sustainability profile. Cost considerations play a crucial role in long-term investment performance, with both funds offering exceptionally low expense ratios that minimize the impact of fees on returns. VTI charges an expense ratio of 0.03%, and VOO maintains an identical 0.03% fee structure. These ultra-low costs reflect Vanguard's commitment to providing cost-effective index investing solutions and represent significant advantages over actively managed alternatives. Tax efficiency represents another important consideration for taxable account investors. Both funds demonstrate excellent tax efficiency through their index-based strategies and Vanguard's management approach. VTI's broader diversification and lower turnover rate of 4% compared to typical actively managed funds helps minimize taxable distributions. The fund's structure allows for efficient tax management through in-kind redemptions and careful portfolio management practices. VOO similarly demonstrates strong tax efficiency characteristics, with its focus on S&P 500 companies providing stable, predictable holdings that require minimal trading activity. Both funds typically generate most of their taxable distributions through qualified dividends rather than capital gains, providing favorable tax treatment for most investors. The funds' similar tax efficiency profiles mean that cost considerations alone are unlikely to drive investment decisions between these two options. Understanding how VTI and VOO perform across various market conditions provides crucial insights for investors seeking to optimize their portfolio allocation based on economic expectations and market outlook. Historical analysis reveals distinct performance patterns that can help guide investment decisions during different market environments. During bull market periods, the performance differential between VTI and VOO often depends on which market segments lead the advance. When small- and mid-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks, VTI typically demonstrates superior returns due to its broader market exposure. This outperformance can be particularly pronounced during the early stages of economic recoveries when smaller companies benefit from improving business conditions and increased risk appetite among investors. Technology sector performance significantly influences both funds during bull markets, though VOO's slightly higher technology weighting can amplify gains when tech stocks lead market advances. Historical analysis shows that during sustained bull markets, both funds tend to perform similarly over extended periods, with short-term performance differences often evening out as market cycles progress. VTI's broader exposure may provide additional upside during periods of broad-based market strength when smaller companies participate fully in market gains. Growth expectations during bull markets often favor VTI's approach, as smaller companies typically offer higher growth potential compared to their large-cap counterparts. This growth premium can translate into superior returns during optimistic market periods when investors are willing to pay higher valuations for growth prospects. However, VOO's focus on established companies can provide more sustainable gains during later stages of bull markets when quality and profitability become more important than pure growth potential. Bear market performance reveals more significant differences between these funds' risk characteristics. VOO's focus on large-cap stocks typically provides better defensive characteristics during market downturns, as larger companies often possess stronger balance sheets and more diversified revenue streams that help them weather economic storms. These companies also tend to have better access to capital markets and more established relationships with lenders, providing additional financial flexibility during challenging periods. VTI's broader market exposure can amplify losses during bear markets, particularly when small- and mid-cap stocks experience disproportionate declines. Smaller companies often face greater liquidity constraints, higher borrowing costs and more concentrated business risks that can lead to more severe price declines during economic contractions. This vulnerability can result in VTI experiencing deeper drawdowns compared to VOO during significant market stress periods. Recovery patterns following bear markets often favor VTI's broader exposure, as smaller companies may rebound more dramatically once economic conditions improve. However, this recovery potential comes with the trade-off of potentially experiencing more severe initial declines. VOO's more stable large-cap focus may provide better downside protection but potentially slower recovery rates compared to the broader market exposure offered by VTI. Choosing between VTI and VOO requires careful consideration of individual investment objectives, risk tolerance and portfolio context. Risk tolerance alignment is a crucial factor, with VTI's broader market exposure potentially suiting investors who are comfortable with additional volatility in exchange for more comprehensive market participation. Conservative investors or those approaching retirement may find VOO's large-cap focus more appropriate for their stability requirements. Time horizon considerations also influence fund selection decisions. Longer investment horizons may favor VTI's broader diversification, as extended periods allow investors to benefit from the full spectrum of market opportunities while weathering short-term volatility. Shorter time horizons might benefit from VOO's more stable large-cap focus, which can provide more predictable performance patterns over limited periods. Portfolio context plays an important role in fund selection, particularly for investors holding other investments alongside their core equity allocation. Investors with existing small-cap exposure through other funds might prefer VOO to avoid overweighting smaller companies, while those seeking comprehensive market exposure through a single fund might favor VTI's total market approach. The choice often depends on overall portfolio construction strategy and the role each fund plays within the broader investment framework. Financial analysts and investment professionals generally view both VTI and VOO favorably, recognizing their roles as core portfolio holdings for different investor types. Many experts appreciate VTI's comprehensive market coverage, noting its ability to provide complete U.S. equity exposure through a single, low-cost investment vehicle. This total market approach receives praise for its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing broad market returns without requiring investors to make complex allocation decisions between different market segments. VOO receives similar expert endorsement for its focus on quality large-cap companies and its role as a stable core holding. Analysts often recommend VOO for investors seeking predictable large-cap exposure without the additional volatility associated with smaller companies. The fund's track record and its benchmark's long history of representing the core of the U.S. stock market contribute to its widespread professional acceptance and recommendation. Bottom Line VTI and VOO both offer excellent low-cost access to U.S. equity markets, but their different approaches create distinct risk and return profiles. VTI provides broader diversification through total market exposure, potentially offering superior long-term returns at the cost of increased volatility from small- and mid-cap holdings. VOO focuses on large-cap stability and quality, providing more predictable performance with potentially lower upside during periods favoring smaller companies. The choice between these funds ultimately depends on individual risk tolerance, investment timeline, and preference for comprehensive market exposure versus focused large-cap stability. Both represent solid core holdings that can serve as foundation investments for well-diversified portfolios.

Title: An Unsuspecting Contender - Rocky Mountain's Instinct Powerplay SL Long-Term Review
URL: https://www.vitalmtb.com/product/guide/e-bikes/rocky-mountain/instinct-powerplay-sl-67636
Time Published: 2025-07-12T14:05:13Z
Full Content:
Rocky Mountain probably isn't a brand many riders would expect to develop its own cutting-edge e-bike technology. But back in 2009, they did just that, launching Propulsion Powercycle under the same roof as their Quebec HQ. When they introduced their first model, the Altitude Powerplay, in 2017, the proprietary 108Nm Dyname 3.0 motor quietly took the top spot as the most powerful Class 1 E-bike motor. A title that was only recently relinquished to DJI's latest Avinox system. Seven years later, Rocky Mountain has once again pushed the limits of e-bikes with the 2025 Instinct Powerplay SL—their first delve into the lightweight e-bike category. The Powerplay SL offers 65Nm of torque and 550W of power, combined with a 480Wh battery, in a sub-45 lb package. Progressive suspension, adjustable geometry, and size-specific chainstays position the Instinct Powerplay SL as a capable all-rounder. Six months of testing later, let's get into how Rocky's first lightweight e-model performed and where it stands amongst the deep field of SL bikes. When Rocky Mountain unveiled the Dyname 4.0 motor on the Powerplay Lineup in 2021, there were no major performance gains over the then-four-year-old Dyname 3.0 system. Instead, Rocky focused on refining the system, packing it into a smaller space, reducing noise, and significantly cutting weight by over 15%, all while still delivering class-leading torque and power. This led some riders to wonder what it would look like if Rocky were ever to direct that effort at the SL e-bike category. Three years later, we have the answer. Rocky Mountain built on the lessons learned from the full-sized Dyname motors and synthesized them into the Dyname S4 Lite, a 65Nm, 550W motor that weighs only 5 lbs, available exclusively on the 145mm travel Instinct Powerplay SL. Coming in at only 43 lbs, the Instinct Powerplay SL fits comfortably into the SL e category, which seems to capture everything between 38 and 45 lbs, and does so with more battery and significantly more power than most other options. Size-specific chainstays and shock tunes, a reach-adjust headset, and adjustable geometry suggest that Rocky Mountain isn't just interested in mimicking the weight of a normal bike, but the ride experience as well. Like the rest of the Powerplay lineup, the Instinct SL uses a mid-pivot, four-bar suspension layout and a counter-rotating upper rocker link. Though Rocky has not published much about their kinematics, one can expect a good amount of leverage progression, somewhat neutral antirise, high antisquat, and a small amount of rearward wheel path. An integrated, removable battery surrounded by internal guide tubes for all cables and wires rounds out the basic features. The Instinct Powerplay SL is available in three full-carbon builds, ranging from $7,999 to $11,999, in addition to three aluminum builds priced from $5,499 to $7,999. We tested the Carbon 90 build, which came loaded with FOX Factory suspension, a full Race Face Era kit, handling wheels, bars, and cranks, SRAM Code Ultimate Stealth brakes, and an X0 Eagle Transmission drivetrain. Unlike most e-bikes, the Instinct Powerplay SL uses a BB92 pressfit bottom bracket and traditional cranks. Carbon and aluminum models share the same Dyname S4 Lite motor, integrated display, and geometry adjustments. The Dyname S4 Lite has five modes: Walk, Eco, Trail, Trail+, and Ludicrous. The motor can store three different power presets: Factory, Tune A, and Tune B. Tune A and B are adjustable with options to increase or decrease the assist for each mode, represented as a percentage. There is also a boost setting to configure how sensitive the motor is to rider inputs, which has five modes ranging from -2 (least sensitive, 'heavy workout') to +2 (most sensitive, 'low effort'). All motor configuration takes place on the display and with the mode selector switch. Personally, not having to download or open an app whenever I want to adjust the assist or see the odometer is a huge plus. You can even cycle through all three motor tunes and customize them without stopping. The Instinct SL features adjustable reach via included offset headset cups and adjustable head angle, bottom bracket height, and seat angle via the RIDE-4 chips in the upper shock link. Unlike its analog counterpart, the Instinct Powerplay SL does not feature an adjustable chainstay length. I did not make use of the +/-5mm adjustable reach, but as someone who grew up with chronic small bike syndrome, I appreciated having the option. RIDE-4 is a simplified version of Rocky's near-extinct RIDE-9 adjustment. It offers four geometry settings, taking the head angle from 63.5° to 64.2° and raising the bottom bracket about a centimeter. Four settings to change the head angle by 0.7 ° is excessive, but again, I appreciated having the option. I spent most of my time with the bike in position 3, the second highest/steepest. Allegedly, a mullet link will be available in the future and will be compatible with the SM-XL frames. Assembling the bike was straightforward and pain-free. Home mechanics that opt to have the bike delivered can expect to install the handlebar, front brake, front wheel, and battery, as well as run the cable, and cut the housing for the dropper post. The housing is already run through the frame, and the SRAM Transmission drivetrain is already paired and adjusted. All cables are internally routed with individual guide tubes that end at the base of the battery for easy access. Battery fitment is thoughtful, as it glides past the motor and is secured with two bolts. Aside from swapping out the 20mm rise Race Face Era Carbon handlebar for a more appropriate 40mm version, and eventually the EXO+ MaxxTerra Minion DHF for a DoubleDown MaxxGrip High Roller, the bike was left stock for the duration of the test. Motor Performance The Instinct SL was my first experience with Dyname's motor. Having spent extensive time on TQ's HPR50 and around Specialized's SL 1.2, the S4 Lite motor produced a noise level comparable to that of the HPR50. It does a good job of disappearing into the background with practically no whining or whirring. However, the S4 Lite has a persistent, unpleasant grinding that stems from the motor's integrated upper pulleys. Dyname's motors utilize two pulley wheels that sit above the chainring. One pulley serves as a traditional high-pivot idler, neutralizing chain forces from the suspension. The other monitors the tension between the chainring and pulley, telling the motor how much power to deliver. Both are protected by a small plastic cover that serves to keep out the elements and keep the chain secure on the idler. The pulleys are rough enough that the first ride around the neighborhood actually left a tingling sensation in my feet from the vibrations being transmitted through the pedals. They did wear in fairly quickly, to the point that I stopped noticing it after the first few rides. But the noise never went away and was audible to those around me when cruising on smooth pavement. When pedaling, the S4 Lite responds proportionately to rider input, all the way down to zero input. Unlike TQ's less powerful HPR50, where there seems to be a floor of minimum assistance, the S4 Lite has no such floor—give the motor very little and very little assistance you shall receive in return. This form of power delivery does come with a consequence: resting your foot on the pedal while stopped kills power to the motor and triggers an alert that the motor will eventually need to be recalibrated. Simply unweighting the pedal is enough to get the power back, and recalibration is a one button procedure handled through the onboard display, but that didn’t make it any less annoying. The S4 Lite also had an interesting flaw where the pulley noise and vibration would become increasingly worse as assist or RPM decreased. Pedaling at a low RPM with minimum assistance turned the grinding into an unpleasant clunking that was quite distracting. That quirk, alongside the fact that pedaling mountain bikes with your own legs is hard, discouraged me from dropping the assist below Trail+ (the third-highest assist level). The Instinct SL does have a relatively generous 480Wh battery, dwarfing the 360Wh and 320Wh batteries found on Trek's Fuel EXe and Specialized's SL models and just edging out the 430Wh battery found on Fazua's Ride 60 system. I never experienced any range anxiety. The 480Wh battery even allowed me to complete a 5,000 ft day without ever using Eco mode. The available Overtime 2.0 Range Extender can take the Instinct SL up to a massive 794Wh, which should cover the needs of 99.9% of riders. The Power offered by the motor is exceptional. With a peak power of 550W, the S4 Lite is within spitting distance of many current full-size e-bikes, including Shimano's EP801, which maxes out at 600W. I could join full-size e-bikes on trail climbs and keep up fairly well, though I would expect to get dropped on a sustained fire road climb. Climbing Performance Like most E-bikes ought to be, climbing the Instinct SL is nearly effortless. Its overall low weight, bolstered by EXO+ tires and the carbon Race Face Era wheels, made for a bike that gets up to speed quickly and has no problem maneuvering technical climbs. The 658mm top tube of the XL Instinct was plenty roomy for my 6'2" stature, though I would have happily traded a centimeter or two to bring the seat tube angle up to 79° from 77° as the front of the bike had a tendency to wander on steeper climbs. The rear shock did sink deeper into its travel than I would prefer on technical or rough climbs, leaving me vulnerable to pedal strikes. This occurred with 25% sag. The Float X shock does feature a climb switch, but I found it too firm to be all that useful on anything but roads. Closing the low-speed compression helped, but it made the shock spike on square-edge hits when descending. Ultimately, I ran the shock oversprung to help mitigate pedal strikes and dealt with the consequences otherwise. Descending As soon as I dropped into my first downhill aboard the Instinct SL, it was apparent just how long and balanced the geometry felt. Even when diving into steep corners, I found it easy to keep my weight over the front wheel while maintaining a neutral and upright body position. I had no trouble maneuvering the XL Instinct's 1306mm wheelbase around tight corners, either. The centered riding position made it effortless to unweight the rear wheel without getting the sensation of being in front of the front axle. I attribute this, in part, to the 450mm chainstays found on the L and XL. While 450mm is not huge, that number should start to approach 460mm at sag, thanks to the Instinct's mid-pivot design, contributing to a neutral body position. I would like to see larger jumps between sizes, a la Forbidden, but nonetheless, it beats the hell out of the 430mm chainstays found on most other XL SL e-bikes. The second thing I noticed was the unbalanced compression damping between the fork and shock. Even with Rocky Mountain's size-specific shock tunes, the fork had a noticeably more damped feel than the shock. On longer sections, I would feel my weight progressively shift backward after repeated compressions, requiring a conscious 'reset' to get back in the middle of the bike. I think this could be resolved with a firmer high-speed compression tune on the shock to better match the race feel of the Grip X2 36. I could probably get a more balanced feel by backing off the HSC on the fork, and putting in some volume spacers to maintain the bottom out resistance, but I think I'd be holding the bike back in terms of its descent capabilities. The only time I felt the bike took focus to ride was when resisting front wheel deflections. I found the Grip X2 Fox 36 to not track great over baby head rocks or angled square edge hits. I was able to mitigate this somewhat by replacing the EXO+ casing front tire with a heavier and softer DoubleDown, improving the material damping at the front of the bike.Still, the firm damping of the X2 that encouraged me to take the roughest of straight lines also demanded focus to not get caught out. At $12,000, one would expect the Instinct SL's parts spec not to leave one wanting, and that's mostly the case. The Race Face carbon wheels and cranks performed admirably without issue, the FOX Factory suspension was reliable, and I smashed the X0 Eagle derailleur so hard that I actually heard it move out of the way by like six gears, then reset back in place unaffected. Some riders may prefer heavier casing tires than the EXO+ featured across all build kits. I found them to be plenty durable for my needs, brushing off rock strikes and knife edges that would have ended an EXO casing tire's career. I'm less jazzed about the MaxxTerra compound used for both tires. It's passable for a rear tire but bordering on hazardous as a front tire. I would like to see a firmer tune on the rear shock as well as a rolling change to the new and improved FOX 36 to address the deflection issues I was having. The only component that degraded was the FOX Transfer post, which started getting sticky after just a few rides, struggling to reach full extension. Finally, I had no issues with the SRAM Codes that came on this bike, but in a world where Mavens exist, I'd like to see Mavens specced in the future. $12,000 is a lot of money to spend on a bike, yet somehow the C90 build that was tested is somewhere between average and above average value for the money. An equivalent build of Trek's Fuel EXe will set you back an additional $1,200. The $9,699 Carbon 70 build trades the Factory Grip X2 Suspension for Performance Elite Grip X, retains wireless shifting in the form of GX Transmission, downgrades to Code Silver brakes, and still comes in at a respectable 43.5 lbs. Of all of Rocky Mountain's offerings, the C70 is the one I would choose as a customer. At this price point, the equivalent Fuel EXe 9.8 T-Type comes spec'd with RockShox Select+ suspension and Code R brakes, which I feel is a real performance sacrifice. For me, the heart of the Powerplay SL is the low weight and high power, and while the C50 build does retain that at only 44 lbs, the RockShox Select Suspension, XT brakes, and Novatec wheels diminish the value of the low weight and power. Rocky Mountain does offer a range of aluminum builds, but I have a hard time rationalizing the build kits for anyone looking for solid downhill performance out of the box. The Alloy 70 BC Edition comes in at $8,000 fitted with Select+ suspension, Code Bronze brakes, GX Eagle Transmission, and a weight penalty to the tune of 48.5 lbs. For $200 less, a customer could roll away with a top of the line Commencal Meta Power SX 400 with Factory Grip X2 suspension, SRAM Code brakes, and a much less finicky Bosch SX motor, for practically the same weight. I spent several months on the Instinct SL and never had to tighten so much as a bolt or spoke. An included extra downtube guard should provide any necessary protection on shuttle days, and the motor showed no signs of degenerative wear, including the pulley wheels, despite creaking that suggested otherwise. The reach-adjust headset cup did produce some noise after a few rides. I was initially concerned when I pulled on the headset cup, and it came out by hand, but then I noticed the cup had an O-ring around it, meaning it was likely functioning as intended. I greased up the seal and the frame/cup interface and the noise went away. For a certain subset of riders, the pressfit BB92 bottom bracket will be a turn-off, but I have never had an issue with one. Given Rocky Mountain's financial situation, I would have concerns about being able to find service parts or fulfill a warranty if they were to shut their doors, however, the Instinct Powerplay SL gave no indication that the warranty would be needed. It's also worth mentioning that Dyname has recently updated their website, stating they are no longer exclusive to Rocky Mountain, and are looking for new partners, hinting at some continued motor support should Rocky Mountain close down. Despite the Dyname motor's rough-around-the-edges feeling, I had a blast riding the Instinct Powerplay SL. Progressive geometry, a ton of power, light overall weight, and solid range had me reaching for the bike as much as I could. Perhaps not quite a quiver killer, the Instinct SL held it down under a wide range of trails. It would not be my first choice if I were planning on spending a lot of time at bike parks, however, I'm confident it's up to the task. While I would struggle to encourage anyone to spend $12,000 on any bike, let alone one with the motor issues I encountered, the lower-priced builds can offer more value at a similar weight with specs that should cover most riders' needs, especially those less fussy about suspension performance. If you are searching for a lightweight eMTB that will let you nearly keep up with your friends on full-power bikes without compromising on geometry or riding experience, I would suggest being open to the Instinct Powerplay SL.

More Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia’s valuation reached the $4 trillion mark this week, while co-founder Jensen Huang’s shares are now worth something like $143 billion. Present and future retirees should rejoice the rapidly increasing wealth inequality that Nvidia and Huang represent. That’s because inequality is the greatest gift to retirement of all. To see why, contemplate the “Magnificent Seven” stocks known to be the biggest drivers of the bull market of the present. Doing so requires a brief look backwards. If you purchased Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia early, you’re presently not worried about having enough money for retirement. Huang was of course at Nvidia in the beginning, and his enormous wealth exists as evidence of what can happen when early investors or employees stay the proverbial course amid immense share-price volatility. Twice in Nvidia’s public life its shares have dropped 90 percent on their way to gains greater than 300,000% to the present. That has been the norm among corporations that make up the Magnificent 7. Lots of ups and downs that the typical retail investor saving for retirement can’t endure. Which is the point. Thanks to index funds and ETFs that track the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, or for that matter global stock market indices, retirement savers don’t have to be early to transformative business concepts. Much more importantly, they don’t have to pick the shares that will eventually soar. Instead, they merely need to be invested. From there the stock market will not only do their worrying for them, their investment in broad indices ensures that they’ll have growing exposure to the very few corporations that unexpectedly emerge as the bluest of blue chips. That’s why present and future retirees should cheer rising inequality. Exactly because index funds and ETFs are frequently market-cap weighted, ownership of stock indexes evolves to reflect the most highly valued stocks most prominently. That’s where wealth inequality comes in. It’s an effect of entrepreneurs discovering a future of commerce that most never imagined. Since entrepreneurs are much earlier to world-changing and improving ideas than the markets themselves, they capture the majority of market gains from their discovery of what was only obvious after the fact. Still, would-be retirees once again don’t need to be early. They just need to be positioned for exposure to the high-flyers of today and tomorrow through broad market exposure. If so, as in if and when the next commercial visionary happens on a new idea that investors gradually fall in love with, the typical retirement investor stands to prosper substantially thanks to the genius of compounding. The good news is that the potential to compound one’s wealth grows by the day as the world shrinks by the day through commercial advances that reach greater and greater numbers of people. This is wealth inequality, and it’s transforming the quality of retirement for the much better.

Title: 6 Best Bank Stocks To Watch As 2008 Financial Crisis Rules Are Eased

Time Published: 2025-07-12T13:00:00Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. If regulators ease capital requirements as proposed, financial institutions will have more balance ... More sheet freedom to make loans or fund other growth opportunities. Deregulation is a theme of the Trump administration, and bank stocks may soon benefit. In June 2025, regulators proposed a change to a 2014 rule enacted after the 2008 Financial Crisis. If approved, the update could free up capital for banks and financial companies to pursue growth. Let's review which banking rules are changing, and meet six bank stocks most likely to benefit. The 2008 Financial Crisis rules are U.S. regulatory changes enacted after several major U.S. financial companies failed in 2008. The failures contributed to a historic U.S. recession and a European debt crisis. The legislative reforms aimed to prevent similar economic crises from happening again. The rules that may be eased in 2025 involve capital requirements. Capital includes cash and easily sold assets that can absorb losses and fund debt repayments. Regulators specify how much capital financial institutions must have relative to their debts. These requirements help to ensure financial stability and solvency through economic downturns. Up for modification is the enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (eSLR). Under current rules, the largest U.S. banks must have an eSLR of 5%. Proposed changes would lower that requirement to 3.5% to 4.25% at the big banks, depending on their risk profile. Other rules governing long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity would be updated to align with the new eSLR threshold. Proponents say the changes will increase banks' participation in Treasury markets, promote lending and boost the economy. Detractors argue that easing the eSLR and related requirements will increase the chances of bank failures. The table below highlights six large, globally important bank stocks that may soon see a reduction in their eSLR requirement. You may want to add these to your own list of best stocks for 2025. A review of each financial company follows. Metrics are sourced from company reports and stockanalysis.com, unless noted otherwise. Citigroup by the numbers: Citigroup operates through five businesses: services, markets, banking and international, wealth and U.S. personal banking. The first three cater to corporate and institutional clients and the last two serve consumers. Citigroup has a strong institutional client roster plus 70 million personal banking clients. The bank has physical locations in 94 countries and operates in nearly 180 countries. Last year, Citigroup was wrapping up a broad restructuring effort that trimmed its workforce by about 10%. Staff reductions and other cost-cutting efforts helped the company deliver 2024 net income of $12.7 billion, up 37% from the year before. In the first quarter of 2025, Citigroup reported a 5% quarter-over-quarter decline in operating expenses—showing continued cost discipline. The bank also reported revenue growth in all five of its businesses. Citigroup’s financial position remains strong. At the end of the first quarter, the bank's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) was 13.4%. The CET1 ratio is the bank's core capital—primarily ordinary shares and retained earnings—as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. The ratio measures financial resilience. Higher is better. The minimum CET1 ratio regulators require varies by institution. Citigroup's minimum is 12.1%. The Bank of New York Mellon by the numbers: BK is the holding company for Bank of New York Mellon or BNY. BNY is America's oldest bank and a specialist in custodial services. Custodian banks safeguard securities for their customers. BNY customers include Fortune 100 companies, governments and pension plans. BK launched an enterprise-wide AI effort in 2023. The strategy led to the creation of an in-house AI platform that BK employees use for risk management, operational efficiency and predictive trade analytics. The bank’s digital transformation has been good for business. In 2023 and 2024, BK increased net income by 29% and 37%, respectively. In the same years, EPS grew 35% and 49% with help from BK's generous share repurchase activity. Share repurchases totaled $2.6 billion in 2023 and $3.1 billion in 2024. First quarter highlights included revenue growth of 6% and diluted EPS growth of 26% from the prior-year quarter. The bank’s CET1 ratio was 11.5%. Also notable is BK's dividend program. The financial company has raised its dividend annually by at least 9% over the last three years. The current annual payout is $1.88, for a yield of 2%. State Street Corporation by the numbers: State Street is a large custodian bank that provides investment servicing solutions for institutional investors. The company's AI-enabled Alpha platform helps investors manage their assets and make data-driven decisions. State Street also offers ETFs and mutual funds through its State Street Investment Management business, formerly known as SSGA. State Street’s stock price is up nearly 12.5% for the year, after being down 25% in early April. Several analysts expect the gains to continue. Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo, Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs and Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley, among others, raised their STT price targets in July. Acquisitions and partnerships have contributed to the optimism. International transactions, including the purchase of Mizuho Financial Group’s global custody business, provide access to new growth markets for STT. Partnerships like the strategic relationship with Ray Dalio's hedge fund Bridgewater Associates support new offerings for existing customers. State Street's first quarter earnings show progress on revenue and expenses. Total revenue was up 5% and fee revenue gained 6%. Expenses declined 3%. EPS rose 49% to $2.04. At quarter-end, State Street's CET1 ratio was 11%, down slightly from the prior-year quarter. Bank of America by the numbers: Bank of America provides banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses in the U.S. and more than 35 countries. The bank is the largest small business lender domestically and has been ranked in the top three for global investment banking fees and global research. At least six analysts have raised their price targets on BAC since early June. The consensus second quarter EPS outlook is $0.87, which represents 4.8% growth from last year. For the first quarter, BAC reported 6% revenue growth, 3% net interest income growth, 3% growth in average deposit balances and 4% higher average loans and leases. Notably, it was the seventh consecutive quarter the bank increased average deposits. Diluted EPS was $0.90, up from $0.76 in the prior-year quarter. At quarter-end, the bank’s CET1 ratio was 11.8%. Bank of America pays a quarterly dividend of $0.26, for a yield of 2.2%. The bank also approved a $25 billion share repurchase program last year. Share repurchases in the first quarter totaled $4.5 billion. Goldman Sachs by the numbers: Goldman Sachs is organized into three businesses: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. Global Banking & Markets, the largest segment, provides investment banking services. Asset & Wealth Management manages money for institutions, advisors, foundations and high-net-worth individuals. Platform Solutions offers embedded financial products and a transaction banking platform. Goldman Sachs has been making moves to leverage its expertise and reputation in investment banking and trading operations. Last year, the financial company sold a credit card business, home-improvement lending operation and personal financial management unit. First quarter 2025 results indicate the refocus is driving results. The company earned $15 billion in net revenue, its third-highest quarterly sales result. The Global Banking & Markets business contributed $10.7 billion to that tally, partly due to record net revenues in Equities. GS also earned the top global ranking for announced and completed mergers and acquisitions and equity offerings. Diluted EPS in the first quarter was $14.12, 22% higher than the prior-year quarter. GS also spent $4.6 billion on common share repurchases and authorized a new $40 billion repurchase program. The financial company's CET1 ratio is currently 14.83%, 1.23 percentage points higher than its required level. Morgan Stanley by the numbers: Morgan Stanley is a wealth manager serving institutions, governments and consumers. The company offers investment banking services to businesses and governments, sales and trading support to hedge funds and active investment management services to people and institutions. Morgan Stanley also publishes investment research. Morgan Stanley has two primary longer-term goals: to increase client assets to $10 trillion from $7.7 trillion currently, and to realize a 30% pre-tax margin in its Wealth Management business. The Wealth Management growth strategy involves acquiring new customers from ETrade, workplace channels and financial advisors. The three-pronged approach has been effective. Since 2018, Morgan Stanley has increased the number of households served by 20 million, from 2.5 million to 22.5 million. The momentum is one reason why analysts expect the financial company to report EPS of $2.01 for the second quarter, up from $1.82 in last year’s June quarter. First quarter 2025 highlights for Morgan Stanley included quarter-over-quarter net revenue growth of 17% and diluted EPS growth of 29%. The Wealth Management pretax margin was 26.6% and the CET1 ratio at quarter-end was 15.3%. Morgan Stanley also spent $1 billion on stock repurchases in the quarter and declared a $0.925 quarterly dividend. Bottom Line If regulators ease capital requirements as proposed, financial institutions will have more balance sheet freedom to make loans or fund other growth opportunities. The freedom does bring higher risk, so lean into banks with disciplined leadership teams and conservative lending practices.

Title: EWCZ Marketing Shift Shows Early Wins: Can Growth Reignite Fast?

European Wax Center, Inc. EWCZ has made a decisive pivot to revamp its marketing engine and early signs point to meaningful traction. After implementing a modern advertising effectiveness platform in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, EWCZ reported sequential improvements in new guest trends compared with the same period two years ago. While the lift remains modest, this directional movement is critical for a brand that has struggled to grow traffic in recent quarters.At the core of this transformation is a push toward data-driven, digital-first marketing. With upgraded measurement tools now in place, EWCZ is able to link media impressions to in-center behavior, enabling smarter allocation of marketing dollars and a lower cost per acquisition. Creative and messaging tests are underway, with initial feedback suggesting the brand’s updated identity is resonating, especially among higher-value, more loyal guest segments.This effort goes beyond surface-level branding. Marketing execution is being tightly integrated with franchisee operations through new support tools, enhanced guest communication platforms like email and SMS, and the planned launch of a champion ad campaign during the peak summer season. These coordinated efforts aim to strengthen traffic recovery and unlock additional guest visits. While the initiative is still in early stages, management is confident that the company is gaining momentum and its sharpened marketing engine will drive meaningful traffic and sales growth in the second half of 2025. Coty Inc. COTY continues to evolve its marketing strategy by shifting resources toward high-ROI categories like mass fragrances while scaling back in lower-return color cosmetics. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Coty emphasized influencer-driven content and campaigns, such as its viral Rimmel UK push, to optimize digital reach with lower spend. However, inconsistent category demand and global channel fragmentation are still impacting Coty’s campaign efficiency.Another peer, Helen of Troy Limited HELE, is focusing on simplifying its marketing execution and prioritizing investments that deliver the highest returns. Helen of Troy is refining its paid media funnel, driving more earned media and reducing content costs across brands like Drybar and Curlsmith. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Helen of Troy reported traction in influencer-backed launches and direct-to-consumer growth, but tariff disruptions and pricing pressure continue to weigh on media performance. Shares of European Wax Center have gained 64.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 50.1%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research From a valuation standpoint, EWCZ trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 8.61X, below the industry’s average of 27.7X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EWCZ’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 35.6% and 8.2%, respectively.

The incredible demand for data is fueling the market's next digital gold rush.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. While ChatGPT’s meteoric rise in popularity has positioned it to rival to traditional search engines, analysts say the chatbot hasn’t knocked Google out of the top spot just yet. Citi Research analysts led by Ronald Josey reiterated a Buy rating and $203 target price on shares of Alphabet, Google’s parent, on Friday. The stock was down slightly at $177.18 in morning trading. Citi polled 2,400 Google Search users in the U.S. and found that the search engine “remains core to most users’ Internet usage." The same conclusion held true across all age groups, Citi said. Still, the bank cited a rise in “alternative search experiences" among young users, naming ChatGPT and Meta Platforms’ Facebook and Instagram as examples. ChatGPT has become the “go-to" destination for younger users, with Google usage rising with age, Citi said. While 85% of respondents selected Google as their “core search engine," with 72% saying Google was their first site to search online, differences emerged among age groups. Among users aged 41 to 55, 88% of respondents named Google as their core search engine, but that number dipped to 83% for respondents aged 14 to 24. With that being said, the use of AI agents appears to be “more research-driven than commercial," as opposed to Google Search, where shopping was ranked as the top use case among respondents, Citi said. And the bank believes there’s more to love about Google’s growth story, as responses indicated that the use of other features such as Shopping and Travel continued to accelerate. Overall, the results suggest that Google Search is standing its ground for now, which is good news for Alphabet. Revenue attributed to Google Search and other services accounted for more than half of the total in the latest quarter. Google is set to report second-quarter results on July 23. Based on Citi’s preliminary analysis, “we believe the broader online advertising environment, including search and YouTube, is healthy," the analysts wrote. Other firms have sounded the alarm about AI and its effects on Google Search. However, Citi believes the search engine’s advertising market improved throughout the quarter. Earnings will put that theory to the test. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks. It'll just take a moment.

Title: AI automation slashes 25 percent of entry-level tech jobs; half of junior roles at risk

Layoffs at firms such as Amazon and Microsoft have sharply focused on artificial intelligence as a catalyst for workforce reduction. Executives admit that automation will trim head counts in coming years, leaving many employees unsure whether experience offers better protection. Some predict that entry-level staff will be first to go because their routine duties automate easily; Anthropic’s chief executive even warned that half of all junior white-collar roles could disappear within five years. Others argue that older, well-paid employees who rely on long-established workflows are more exposed, especially if they fail to adapt. Early field data points toward pressure on newcomers. ADP payroll figures show employment for workers with less than two years’ tenure in computing roles fell about a quarter after peaking in 2023. Customer service jobs follow the same pattern. A temporary ChatGPT ban in Italy produced similar data: junior coders finished tasks slightly faster. However, mid-level developers used the tool to oversee peers and work across unfamiliar languages, raising their overall value. The threat to seasoned professionals is real, however. AI systems can now draft legal briefs and write production code, eroding the premium once attached to deep domain expertise. Law firms that deploy generative models report using roughly half as many contract attorneys and major tech companies continue to cut experienced managers and engineers while betting heavily on automation. As companies hire mostly junior workers boosted by AI and a handful of senior overseers, mid-level roles could disappear. That shift would shrink tax revenues and put more strain on unemployment benefits and other support programs. Lawmakers are already looking at ways to retrain displaced staff and make sure everyone shares in AI’s productivity gains. NY Times (in English)

Indeed and Glassdoor will cut 1,300 jobs due to AI, landlines are thriving in the business world and Pop-Tarts' mascots are heading to Ireland for CFB opening game. Recruit Holdings is eliminating about 1,300 jobs at Indeed and Glassdoor through layoffs. The Japan-based parent company announced the layoffs at the two websites Thursday, saying the move will trim the workforce of its HR technology segment by roughly 6%. Recruit Holdings and Indeed CEO Hisayuki Idekoba said in an email to employees that the company "must adapt by ensuring our product delivers truly great experiences for jobseekers and employers" as artificial intelligence is "changing the world." Indeed in Austin, Texas, March 11, 2023. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images / Getty Images) The layoffs come as Recruit Holdings looks to "achieve company priorities," he told employees. AMAZON CEO SAYS AI WILL REDUCE HIS COMPANY'S WORKFORCE The layoffs target employees on the "R&D, GRO, and People & Sustainability teams" in the U.S. "but span all functions and several countries," according to Idekoba’s email.

(Shoko Takayasu/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) Indeed and Glassdoor have belonged to Recruit Holdings since 2012 and 2018, respectively. The CEO said operations of the latter will be merged into Indeed. That is part of a bid "toward a simpler hiring experience for jobseekers and employers," according to the email.

MICROSOFT WILL LAY OFF NEARLY 6,000 EMPLOYEES IN PUSH FOR EFFICIENCY Indeed Chief People and Sustainability Officer LaFawn Davis is departing in September. After her exit, the Indeed team will be headed by Recruit Holdings COO Ayano Senaha, Idekoba said. Recruit Holdings said in a press release its consolidated financial guidance for fiscal year 2025 "remains unchanged at this time," and the effects of the layoffs have "already been largely incorporated" into its expectations for its HR Technology segment "on a U.S. dollar-basis." In early May, the company projected revenue for fiscal year 2025 to come in at 3.52 trillion yen.

Major U.S. equity indexes moved lower as markets wrapped up the third quarter's first full week of trading. Trade policy remained in focus heading into the weekend, with Canada among the latest countries to receive a letter from President Donald Trump about tariffs set to take effect in August. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% on Friday, retreating from the record closing high set in the previous session. The Nasdaq also fell from record levels, ticking 0.2% lower, while the Dow dropped 0.6%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. PayPal (PYPL) shares fell 5.7%, retreating the most of any S&P 500 constituent. The payment processor's stock came under pressure following reports that JPMorgan Chase (JPM) plans to begin charging financial technology companies for access to customer data. The move from the largest U.S. bank could have ripple effects as fintechs face fees for data that they previously received without direct charges. The re-escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada weighed on stocks with exposure to the northern neighbor. Shares of human resources software provider Dayforce (DAY) lost 5.2%. In addition to operating headquarters in Toronto as well as Minneapolis, Dayforce has a significant business presence in Canada, including a recently inked contract with the Canadian government. Analysts have suggested that tariff-related impacts on its operations should be limited. Caesars Entertainment (CZR) shares declined 4.7%, giving back a portion of the gains posted in the prior session. Casino stocks came under pressure after regional gaming revenue reports from Indiana and Iowa showed that gaming win totals for casinos in those states were down year-over-year in June. Shares of United Airlines (UAL) sank 4.3%, adjusting their altitude a day after posting the S&P 500's strongest gains with a double-digit surge. Although a strong earnings report and reinstated guidance from Delta (DAL) boosted sentiment around airline stocks this week, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal reportedly expressed concerns that a proposed partnership between United and JetBlue (JBLU) could be harmful to competition. Crude oil futures prices rose about 3% on Friday, with summer travel demand helping sustain the market as forecasts suggest that supply growth could lead to surplus conditions later in the year. Shares of oilfield services firm Halliburton (HAL) advanced 4.2%, notching the top daily performance in the S&P 500, as TD Cowen analysts lifted their price target on the stock. Shares of Halliburton rival Baker Hughes (BKR) added 2.5%. The Wall Street Journal reported that packaged food giant Kraft Heinz (KHC) is preparing for a restructuring plan that could involve spinning off a significant portion of its grocery business. Shares of the company, home to its namesake cheese and ketchup as well as an array of other well-known brands, gained 2.5%. News of the potential break-up of Kraft Heinz came a day after cereal maker WK Kellogg (KLG) said it had been acquired by Italian sweets company The Ferrero Group.

Title: This Group’s Record in Front of the Roberts Court Is Mind-Boggling

Get clear, smart takes on every major ruling. Subscribe to support Slate’s legal coverage. In a provocative dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson recently called out her colleagues on the Supreme Court for appearing “overly sympathetic to corporate interests.” Objecting to a decision allowing fuel companies to sue over clean-air rules that don’t regulate those companies, Jackson described how “moneyed interests” seem to “enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor later echoed that sentiment in a different case, highlighting the court’s reluctance to constrain “regulated businesses” while imposing “Kafkaesque” rules on other litigants, such as “politically disfavored noncitizens.” Jackson and Sotomayor are right to be concerned about the court’s bias toward industry. As the Constitutional Accountability Center has documented, the court has adopted the position advocated by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in nearly 70 percent of its cases since John Roberts became chief justice 20 years ago. Some terms, the Roberts court has sided with the Chamber 80 percent, 90 percent, and even 100 percent of the time. That is a sharp increase from prior decades, when the Chamber’s success rate hovered around 50 percent. Even this remarkable success rate does not fully capture the advances big business has made under the Roberts court. The court’s pro-corporate decisions routinely yield landmark rulings that bulldoze settled doctrine in favor of industry. Take, for instance, the recent trio of cases imposing limits on judicial deference to agency legal views, cutting back on agencies’ ability to adjudicate certain matters in-house, and brushing away time limits on challenging agency regulations. Each decision undermined long-standing precedent, making it more difficult to enforce laws meant to ensure safe workplaces and products, a clean environment, and fair financial dealings. Industry’s “losses” at the Supreme Court, by contrast, are often simply failures to reshape the law even more aggressively in its favor. In these cases, the court maintains the status quo, but it almost never moves the ball significantly in favor of consumers, workers, or the environment. This term, for instance, the court declined to expand the “nondelegation” doctrine, which addresses when Congress can give policymaking authority to agencies, something corporations have long urged to make it more difficult for agencies to regulate them. But the court’s rejection of that effort simply reaffirmed precedent going back a century—and the Chamber has claimed that even the court’s opinion in this case implicitly signals a more restrictive approach to agency authority. This lopsided pattern means that efforts to promote corporate accountability at best tread water, while industry victories regularly reshape the legal landscape. That dynamic is exacerbated by how the court selects cases to hear. Overwhelmingly, the justices choose to review lower-court decisions that go against corporate interests—rarely the opposite. In some recent terms, over 90 percent of the business cases the court chose to hear were corporate challenges to lower-court rulings that favored individuals or the government over industry. By stacking the deck this way, the court gives big business plenty of opportunities to overturn unfavorable decisions, while avoiding putting corporate victories in jeopardy. To illustrate just how skewed the court’s practice has been, during one five-year period the court reversed only two lower-court victories for industry, while reversing nearly 50 lower-court victories for plaintiffs and the government. Big business’s newfound success is partly driven by another trend that has emerged under Chief Justice Roberts: a deep rift between the Democrat- and Republican-appointed justices in business cases. Based on the numbers, the court’s more liberal wing—not its conservative bloc—appears to be following Roberts’ professed model of a neutral umpire calling balls and strikes. The more liberal justices have typically voted for the Chamber of Commerce’s position roughly 50 percent of the time, while the conservative justices have sometimes done so more than 75 percent of the time. Some years, the conservatives have sided with industry nearly twice as often as their colleagues. And tellingly, when business interests prevail, conservative justices almost never dissent. With the recent comments by Jackson and Sotomayor, the court’s own members are now calling attention to this apparent bias. And the conservative supermajority has been unable to muster a response. Justice Brett Kavanaugh attempted to refute Jackson’s accusation that the court acts inconsistently when deciding who to let through the courthouse doors. His response was to cite a list of cases that he claimed showed otherwise. But this list, strikingly, does not include a single case in which the court allowed individuals to sue corporations, or prevented corporations from suing the government. What the record actually shows is that the court invariably sweeps aside procedural roadblocks when industries sue to evade oversight and accountability. But the court does not offer the same solicitude to individual plaintiffs attempting to redress corporate abuse. In the 2010 case Free Enterprise Fund v. PCOAB, for example, the court permitted industries to challenge oversight by agencies they claim are unconstitutional, despite lacking any statutory right to do so. In the 2019 case Seila Law v. CFPB, it held that companies can pursue these sorts of challenges to agency authority without showing that the alleged constitutional flaw made a difference in their case. Both decisions led to major rulings cutting back on agency independence. In West Virginia v. EPA in 2021, the court allowed fossil-fuel interests to sue over an environmental policy that would never have gone into effect regardless, giving the conservative majority the opportunity to endorse the so-called major questions doctrine, which makes it more difficult for Congress to give agencies the authority they need to regulate business. More recently, in Axon Enterprise v. FTC, the justices allowed litigants to go directly to court with objections to agency procedures, instead of waiting for the agency to first complete its proceedings. And in Diamond Alternative Energy v. EPA, which prompted Jackson’s remarks this term, the court let fuel companies challenge an emissions standard based on supposedly “commonsense” speculation about its effects—precisely what the court has long prevented individuals and nonprofits from doing. Compare this indulgent approach with how the court treats other litigants. In sharply divided decisions, it has blocked consumers and employees from leveling the playing field by joining together in class actions. It has repeatedly shut plaintiffs out of court entirely by shunting them into forced arbitration. The court has made itself, not Congress, the arbiter of what counts as an “injury” that can justify a lawsuit—and in the court’s view, being erroneously designated as a terrorist by credit bureaus does not qualify. The court has prevented unhoused people from using the Eighth Amendment to challenge laws that punish them for sleeping outdoors. It has prohibited victims of human rights abuses from suing companies that aided those abuses, pronouncing corporations uniquely immune under a 200-year-old law. It has contorted statutory language to stop immigrants from obtaining effective relief against wrongful detention and deportation. And it has barred individuals from challenging government surveillance because the harms they complained about were too speculative—a lesson the court forgot when industry plaintiffs came before it. As Justice Jackson noted, “the Constitution does not distinguish between plaintiffs whose claims are backed by the Chamber of Commerce and those who seek to vindicate their rights to fair housing, desegrated schools, or privacy.” But if anyone doubts the reality of that statement in practice, the court’s one-sided record “will do little to dissuade them.” Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: Opinion: Talking Point This Week: Trade Tensions, Tariff Jitters Dictate Newsflow
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/opinion/trade-tensions-donald-tariff-jitters-q1-earnings-talking-point-this-week
Time Published: 2025-07-11T18:31:43Z
Full Content:
This week was marked by trade tensions and tariff newsflow, with barbs being exchanged between the US and Brazil. Dollar was steady, but Bitcoin surged to levels not seen before. There were other news, including results flow in India as well as corporate developments. In corporate news, Delta Air Lines soared on strong quarterly results and a raised outlook, while WK Kellogg's shares jumped on reports of a $3 billion acquisition by Ferrero Group. Meanwhile, the EU is urgently seeking a trade deal with the US to avert further tariffs, and the UAE was formally removed from the EU's high-risk list for money laundering. Here are the key talking points this week: Trade Tensions The Biggest Event Global trade tensions just got a whole lot worse! The US is leading the charge with a slew of new tariff announcements that are sparking outrage worldwide. Canada's getting slammed with a 35% tariff on a bunch of imports, effective Aug. 1, because the US claims they're not doing enough to stop fentanyl trafficking. And that's not all - over 20 other countries are in the crosshairs, with tariffs ranging from 15% to 20%. Brazil's getting hit with a whopping 50% tariff, and copper imports are facing a 50% tariff. The US is also threatening a 200% tariff on pharma imports if companies don't move production to the US. This is all about "reciprocal tariffs," but it feels like a full-on trade war. Affected countries are already vowing to fight back and protect their workers, naturally so. Expert Opinion S Naren's insight that "every stock is discovered" reflects India's maturing stock market, where intense competition among brilliant stock pickers has left few undervalued opportunities, pushing investors toward contrarian picks in hated sectors like oil and gas, supported by a 2023 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research showing market efficiency increases with analyst density. The shift from value to momentum investing in a late-cycle economy aligns with historical patterns; a 2021 Journal of Finance study found momentum strategies outperform value strategies by 6% annually in late economic cycles, a trend potentially amplified by India's current earnings revisions and strong domestic flows. Conversation with Sajjid Chinoy and Chetan Ahya suggest that Asia will have to brace for a slowdown, and that may make it difficult for higher growth countries like India to deliver growth too. The lone ranger was JP Morgan's Rajiv Batra, whose note suggests that this quarter will serve as a transition from underwhelming earnings to a decent recovery, driven by the low base from the previous year and a resurgence in economic momentum. Batra expects the Nifty to trade at a level between 26,500-30,000 in the next 6-9 months. When It Rains, It Pours The week had a lopsided newsflow, with the second half standing true to the adage that 'when it rains, it pours'. TCS beat earnings expectations with a better than expected delivery in net profit, but a sluggish revenue growth and a wobble around demand. CEO K Krithivasan is optimistic about new services and deal wins, despite global economic uncertainty. And this weighed in on the stock price, with the IT index coming off for three days on a trot. Meanwhile, Hindustan Unilever is shaking things up with Priya Nair set to become the first female CEO and MD in the company's 92-year history. And Glenmark Pharmaceuticals is celebrating a massive $2 billion deal with AbbVie for its cancer treatment, with a cool $700 million upfront payment. The stock has gained 25% this month, with a 15% move coming in post the announcement. Assumptions Of Dollar Dominance Forever, Are Shaky The past 25 years has seen the UK, France and US issue far too much debt, which Asian countries stacked up in their foreign exchange reserves out of fear for a new Asian crisis. The next question is whether this imbalance can endure. And, if not, how will it be resolved. The answer to the first question is increasingly obvious: Asian countries are becoming ever less fond of US treasuries, gilts and OATs. So what happens next? History shows that such imbalances usually spur an important shift in the value of exchange rates. The country that has issued too many bonds sees its currency fall, while the one that has saved too much sees its currency re-rate. Imagine what will happen to the dollar ahead! Lastly, a (not so) personal question. Fed up with your paycheck? How does $200 million-plus sound? As per a Bloomberg article, that’s what Meta is apparently paying Ruoming Pang, who used to run Apple’s AI models team. More importantly, it is in line with the compensation of other members of Meta’s new “superintelligence” group. Why is this happening? Well, we know AI is all pervasive. But there are minds like Eric Schmidt who believe that the AI revolution is 'underhyped'. If this is an indication that you are assuming that it is overhyped, maybe you should rethink your estimates or assumptions. Have a great weekend. Until Next Time... Niraj Shah

Title: Preorder NOW to get Meta's Limited Edition Oakley smart glasses before everyone else

These 24K gold-accented glasses arrive July 22 but could easily sell out before then; the rest of the Meta Oakley collection arrive later this summer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has launched preorders for its Meta Oakley HSTN Warm Gray Prizm 24K Polarized smart glasses, the first version of these glasses available. And given how quickly they're likely to sell out, you'll want to grab them while you still can! This is Meta's second Limited Edition launch in recent days, after the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition that sold out quickly on many retail sites. So far, these Meta Oakley HSTN Limited Edition glasses are only available on Meta, and there's no saying how much stock is available or if resellers will snag them all. You can wait until "later this summer" for the other HSTN frames — Desert with Ruby lenses, Black with Polar Black, Shiny Brown with Polar Deep-Water, Black with Transitions Amethyst, or Clear with Transitions Grey — and spend only $399, but without the gold accents. The Meta Oakley HSTN glasses offer portable Meta AI insights, a built-in 12MP ultrawide camera with 3024 X 4032 resolution photos, open-ear speakers, IPX4 water resistance, and eight hours of battery life — double what the Ray-Ban Meta glasses offer. This limited-edition version comes with gold accents and isn't likely to stay in stock for long! These striking Meta AI glasses measure 147 mm hinge-to-hinge or 158mm temple length, with no alternate sizes, so check your current glasses to see if they'll fit you well. Meta also doesn't seem to be selling a prescription version of the Limited Edition glasses, unfortunately. They confirmed to us that the $399 glasses pairs will be "Rx-ready" with -6.00 to +4.00 lens power, so you may want to skip this Limited Edition if you want to add some clarity to your AI glasses. If you compare the Meta Oakley HSTNs vs. the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, these Oakley glasses have faster charging, higher video resolution at 3K vs. 1080p, and double the battery life at eight hours. That last point is what makes these Meta Oakley glasses so compelling: They're much less likely to die on you during an all-day outing, especially if you use battery-burning features like Meta AI. We'd hoped that Amazon Prime Day would bring prices down on Ray-Ban Meta glasses, but they've remained stubbornly full price, up to $379. So the price gap between these and the Ray-Bans isn't that great, considering the golden flourishes that Oakley and Meta added. Overall, these Meta Oakley HSTN Limited Edition glasses are striking with their gold finishes and light frames, but some people will prefer to wait for models that aren't quite as flashy, or grab one of the cheaper Ray-Ban models for $299. Alternatively, you can wait for the third-gen Ray-Ban glasses that leaked yesterday, which are rumored to feature a battery boost.

U.S. equities were lower at midday after President Donald Trump made more tariff announcements. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all declined. Trump's plan to slap 35% tariffs on Canadian imports dragged shares of Canada-based companies, including Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and Spotify Technology (SPOT). Shares of lithium producer Albemarle (ALB) dropped on a UBS downgrade, with analysts pointing to an oversupply of lithium threatening to reduce prices. The wins keep coming for Nvidia (NVDA), with shares advancing again after the artificial intelligence chipmaker became the first company to post a market capitalization of $4 trillion. Shares of cryptocurrency-related firms Strategy (MSTR), MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) gained as bitcoin traded at an all-time high. Shares of military drone makers AeroVironment (AVAV) and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS) were lifted by comments from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who announced steps to remove government red tape to boost more Pentagon spending on drones produced in the U.S. Oil and gold futures surged.

Title: Despite SpaceX Protests, FCC Clears AST SpaceMobile’s Massive Satellite
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/networking/30919/despite-spacex-protests-fcc-clears-ast-spacemobiles-massive-satellite
Time Published: 2025-07-11T16:11:11Z
Full Content:
Despite pushback from rival SpaceX, AST SpaceMobile has received FCC approval to launch the company’s massive prototype satellite for phone connectivity from space. On Friday, the FCC granted AST SpaceMobile an experimental license to essentially test FM1, a giant square-shaped satellite that the company has been aiming to launch this month. Although the experimental license prohibits AST from “conducting any commercial operations” through the satellite, the FCC's approval brings the company a step closer to building its satellite-to-phone internet system —avoiding what could have been a prolonged delay The FM1 marks AST’s first attempt at sending up a second-generation BlueBird satellite, which spans around 200 square meters — or about three times the size of the company’s first-generation BlueBirds. The FM1 weighs in at nearly 13,000 pounds and features a "phased array antenna" at about 199 square meters, letting it operate as a cell tower in space. The FM1’s increased size and capability promises to help the Texas-based AST SpaceMobile deliver even better satellite internet connectivity to everyday smartphones through carriers including AT&T and Verizon. The satellite connectivity is designed to power voice, video calls and data to users in cellular dead zones. But the company has been facing a growing rivalry with SpaceX, which has been developing its own competing solution in the cellular Starlink service, set to officially launch through T-Mobile on July 23rd. Earlier this year, SpaceX criticized AST’s plans to launch the FM1, pointing out alleged flaws in the company’s application, including its orbital safety plan for the satellite. Last month, the Elon Musk company also seized on the paperwork problems with AST’s application, and urged the FCC to dismiss it. “The inconsistencies, discrepancies and inadequacies of AST’s orbital debris showings suggest its system will not promote sustainable operations in low-Earth orbit as the Commission’s rules intend,” SpaceX told the FCC on June 27th.

Despite pushback from rival SpaceX, AST SpaceMobile has received FCC approval to launch the company’s massive prototype satellite for phone connectivity from space. On Friday, the FCC granted AST SpaceMobile an experimental license to essentially test FM1, a giant square-shaped satellite that the company has been aiming to launch this month. Although the experimental license prohibits AST from “conducting any commercial operations” through the satellite, the FCC's approval brings the company a step closer to building its satellite-to-phone internet system —avoiding what could have been a prolonged delay The FM1 marks AST’s first attempt at sending up a second-generation BlueBird satellite, which spans around 200 square meters — or about three times the size of the company’s first-generation BlueBirds. The FM1 weighs in at nearly 13,000 pounds and features a "phased array antenna" at about 199 square meters, letting it operate as a cell tower in space. The FM1’s increased size and capability promises to help the Texas-based AST SpaceMobile deliver even better satellite internet connectivity to everyday smartphones through carriers including AT&T and Verizon. The satellite connectivity is designed to power voice, video calls and data to users in cellular dead zones. But the company has been facing a growing rivalry with SpaceX, which has been developing its own competing solution in the cellular Starlink service, set to officially launch through T-Mobile on July 23rd. Earlier this year, SpaceX criticized AST’s plans to launch the FM1, pointing out alleged flaws in the company’s application, including its orbital safety plan for the satellite. Last month, the Elon Musk company also seized on the paperwork problems with AST’s application, and urged the FCC to dismiss it. “The inconsistencies, discrepancies and inadequacies of AST’s orbital debris showings suggest its system will not promote sustainable operations in low-Earth orbit as the Commission’s rules intend,” SpaceX told the FCC on June 27th. But in response, AST told the Commission days later that SpaceX’s objections were baseless and a sign of “anticompetitive behavior aimed at impeding AST SpaceMobile’s progress toward deploying its groundbreaking space-based cellular broadband network.” The FCC itself also found many discrepancies and minor errors in AST’s application, asking them to be corrected.

VANCOUVER, BC, July 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Equity Insider News Commentary – Computing power is accelerating faster than it ever has since the computer was invented. However, with that, so too has the risk potential towards our digital data. According to the 2025 Data Threat Report, 74% of the companies surveyed in Germany view rapid AI advances as the top security risk associated with GenAI. In the UK, the new 10-year economic plan is set to be shaped by AI, cybersecurity, and quantum computing. In Singapore, ST Engineering recently held its largest Cybersecurity Summit to date, with over 1,000 leaders from government, industry and academia, with aims to address growing cyber threats coming from quantum and AI. Clearly the issue of increased threats to cybersecurity coming from AI and quantum computing is a global issue, and advancing the potential counter protection to this are several future-proof advocates with developments coming from Scope Technologies Corp. (CSE: SCPE) (OTCQB: SCPCF), Allot Ltd. (NASDAQ: ALLT), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ: DDOG), and STMicroelectronics N.V. (NYSE: STM). Grand View Research predicts sales of post-quantum cryptography will rise 37.6% per year through 2030. Research and Markets is even more upbeat, calling for 41.47% annual growth and a market worth about US$17.7 billion by the end of the decade. That surge is already opening fresh entry points for retail investors looking to get in early. Grand View Research predicts sales of post-quantum cryptography will rise 37.6% per year through 2030. Research and Markets is even more upbeat, calling for 41.47% annual growth and a market worth about US$17.7 billion by the end of the decade. That surge is already opening fresh entry points for retail investors looking to get in early. Scope Technologies Corp. (CSE: SCPE) (OTCQB: SCPCF) is a quantum-focused cybersecurity company best known for Quantum Security Entropy (QSE), its cloud platform that locks files and messages inside quantum-resilient encryption and a zero-trust framework. QSE uses randomness drawn from quantum processes to stop both today's hackers and tomorrow's "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks. Earlier this week, Scope strengthened its team for the second time in a month, tapping Microsoft and Electronic Arts alumnus Andrew Knight to serve as Vice-President of Product—a hire that caps six weeks of rapid leadership change and signals fresh momentum for the company's quantum-ready security platform. Knight's task is clear: accelerate the road map for Quantum Security Entropy (QSE), the cloud platform that stores files and messages inside quantum-resilient encryption. QSE pairs zero-trust architecture with true entropy—randomness drawn from quantum processes—to stop both today's hackers and tomorrow's "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks. "I'm incredibly excited to join Scope Technologies at such a transformative time," said Knight. "The rise of quantum threats demands proactive solutions, and QSE is uniquely positioned to deliver. I look forward to helping shape its next evolution—bringing together my experience in scalable production pipelines, external ecosystems, and secure product innovation." Knight brings almost twenty years of experience guiding cross-functional game and cloud projects, most recently at Microsoft's Coalition Studios. At Scope he will channel that know-how into speeding up the road map for QSE, the firm's quantum-resilient encryption platform. His brief covers everything from new feature design to partner integrations, giving QSE a product chief who speaks the language of both engineers and enterprise buyers. His arrival follows the June promotion of long-time product lead Ted Carefoot to Chief Executive Officer, a move that shifted the company's focus from R & D to go-to-market execution. Carefoot's background in governance, risk, and compliance shaped QSE's zero-trust architecture and HIPAA-aligned security posture, and industry watchers expect that focus on regulation to continue under his watch. Together, the newly-appointed duo brings decades of game-scale infrastructure, compliance, and enterprise sales experience to a platform already benchmarked at millions of encrypted messages per second. "As Scope Technologies scales its business, having the right leadership at the intersection of technology, operations, and strategic partnerships is key," said Carefoot. "Andrew brings a rare combination of deep technical execution and commercial strategy honed across several sectors such as digital interactive media. Procurement, and partner relationships. His leadership will be central as we evolve QSE's architecture and expand its adoption across enterprise security environments." At the upcoming DEF CON 33 conference in Las Vegas in August, Scope Technologies will step onto the main stage at Quantum Village to outline how quantum algorithms could power a new wave of malware that cracks passwords, hijacks live sessions, and breaks crypto-wallet keys in real time. The talk, led by Carefoot and titled "Quantum Malware: The Emerging Threat Landscape of Post-Quantum Cryptographic Exploits," puts the company in a short list of post-quantum security players chosen to brief the global hacker community—an endorsement that underscores the market's growing focus on quantum-ready defenses. Scope Technologies' upcoming QSE mobile app will carry the platform's encryption and secure messaging to iOS and Android, with features tuned for healthcare, legal, and financial users. The company is also widening its global footprint. It has teamed up with nonprofit World Cyber Health, the group behind Malware Village, to share QSE expertise with public and private security teams. New reseller deals with Asia-Pacific distributor COGITO and Swedish Microsoft partner Coegi Cloud AB open access to more than 40 000 institutional users. On the financing front, Scope Technologies secured a $2.8 million raise earlier this year, supported in part by First Majestic Silver Corp., a former pilot customer that is now a strategic investor. The second tranche, closed in April, will fund client onboarding, mobile rollouts, and further scaling of infrastructure and partner channels. By pairing fresh executive talent with a live, quantum-ready product, Scope is positioning itself as a go-to provider for businesses that need to secure data long after today's encryption standards expire.

(NASDAQ: ALLT) has landed its biggest customer in five years, signing a multi-year deal worth "tens of millions" with a Tier-1 telecom operator in EMEA. The agreement bundles network intelligence, traffic control, and cybersecurity tools to protect both mobile and fixed lines. "This is a major customer win for Allot, the largest in five years, and is pivotal in our journey as we continue to expand our security and network intelligence presence across EMEA" said Eyal Harari, CEO of Allot. "We are excited with this new partnership as we leverage our unique technological advantages and core expertise to support all customer requirements as we progress with our 'security-first' strategy." The win widens Allot's regional reach and underlines growing demand for its security-first approach. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) has teamed up with HCLTech to build "future-ready" AI, cloud, and digital solutions that help enterprises stay secure as technology shifts. "Through this expanded collaboration, AMD and HCLTech can provide businesses across multiple industries with the leading-edge technology solutions they need to accelerate innovation and drive long-term growth," said Dr. Lisa Su, Chair and CEO, AMD. "Combining HCLTech's expertise in digital transformation with our industry-leading EPYC, Instinct and Ryzen PRO processors will enable us to provide enterprises with customized, future-ready solutions that maximize the potential of AI, cloud computing and advanced analytics." The partners will co-invest in innovation labs and training programs that turn AMD EPYC and Instinct chips into tools for faster, safer data processing. The deal gives companies a tested path to modernize with long-term compatibility and reduced cyber-risk. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ: DDOG) has rolled out new AI-first security tools that watch every layer of the tech stack—from source code and data to live applications. The release bundles Code Security, LLM Observability, and an AI agent in Cloud SIEM that spots and fixes risks in real time. "AI has exponentially increased the ever-expanding backlog of security risks and vulnerabilities organizations deal with," said Prashant Prahlad, VP of Products, Security at Datadog. "This is because AI-native apps are not deterministic; they're more of a black box and have an increased surface area that leaves them open to vulnerabilities like prompt or code injection. The latest additions to Datadog's Security Platform provide preventative and responsive measures-powered by continuous runtime visibility-to strengthen the security posture of AI workloads, from development to production." These additions let customers secure fast-moving AI workloads before attackers can exploit fresh gaps. STMicroelectronics N.V. (NYSE: STM) has unveiled a human-presence-detection solution for laptops and PCs that pairs its FlightSense Time-of-Flight sensors with AI algorithms to cut power use by more than 20 percent per day while boosting privacy and security. "Building on the integration of ST FlightSense technology in more than 260 laptops and PC models launched in recent years, we are looking forward to see our new HPD solution contributing to make devices more energy-efficient, secure, and user-friendly," said Alexandre Balmefrezol, Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Imaging Sub-Group at STMicroelectronics. "As AI and sensor technology continue to advance, with greater integration of both hardware and software, we can expect to see even more sophisticated and intuitive ways of interacting with our devices, and ST is best positioned to continue to lead this market trend." The system enables hands-free Windows Hello log-ins, walk-away locking, and alerts if someone peers over the user's shoulder. By embedding these safeguards at the hardware level, ST is helping device makers future-proof user data against emerging threats.

Title: Big Tech Is Making Big Money. Time for More Layoffs?
URL: http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/big-tech-is-making-big-money-time-for-more-layoffs.html
Time Published: 2025-07-11T16:00:07Z

Early this month, Microsoft confirmed it was axing 9,000 employees, or about 4 percent of its workforce, in its third staffing cut of 2025. One might suppose a company that’s been laying people off for three years straight isn’t performing well or is under pressure from shareholders to reduce costs and return to profitability. But that’s not the case here: In April quarterly earnings, Microsoft reported $25.8 billion net income on $70.1 billion in revenue, with optimistic guidance for Q2. Analysts have since improved their forecasts, and on Wednesday, the company’s stock hit an all-time high. Microsoft isn’t alone in cutting workers while things are going great. Since 2022, and most recently in January, Meta has been letting thousands of employees go; it, too, has been beating expectations and reporting massive profits. Google, after layoffs in 2023 and 2024, is now offering buyouts. But the Microsoft example might be the starkest. As recently as five years ago, America’s largest tech companies represented stable, lucrative, and futureproof employment. Collecting just the right qualifications might land you a role at Google or Facebook, where you’d have some of the best and broadest prospects in the entire job market, much of which was starting to look dreary in comparison. (They made an entire movie about being Google interns! Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were terrible in it!) Microsoft, the oldest of the bunch, represented stability twice over: a massive organization with a foot in the future, but also a place where you’d meet people who’d worked there for 30 years. As former employee Daniel Sada writes, some employees saw an implied pact. Microsoft didn’t quite pay as much as some of its peers, but it paid fine, and in exchange, “you [got] stability, reasonable work-life balance, and most importantly, no layoffs.” Now, he says, “the pact is fundamentally broken.” At Microsoft — and across formerly safe big-tech firms — it’s been replaced with new feelings of precarity. From outside the industry, one might see this as an inevitable regression to the American employment mean: an industry where workers were temporarily distracted from, or just mistaken about, the true nature of their relationship with their employers. Things were good, workplace organizing was unnecessary, and everyone was on the same team, until they weren’t, and it was too late. Your job was just another job. From inside the industry — and Microsoft — the transition has been sudden and jarring. After the last round of layoffs, an executive producer at Xbox, where cuts were especially deep, posted a message from light-years outside any imagined “pact”: Matt Turnbull, Executive Producer at Xbox Game Studios Publishing - after the Microsoft layoffs - suggesting on Linkedin that may maybe people who have been let go should turn to AI for help. He seriously thought posting this would be a good idea. As he implies, the specter of AI hangs over these layoffs and others in the industry in unsettling ways. (One major wrinkle in the story of tech-employment exceptionalism is that programming might be one of the most AI-exposed job categories of all.) And while the last few years of layoffs can be understood substantially as a consequence of massive COVID-era overhiring and executive backlash, that excuse is starting to feel insufficient. Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon, all of which are still in cost-cutting mode, are major players in AI. Amazon’s CEO warned that, after it all nets out, AI deployment within the company will probably result in cuts; Meta and Google are bragging about how much code they’re already generating with AI. For now, they’re not connecting cuts with automation, but they’re getting close: Microsoft, while touting quantifiable savings and efficiency gains from AI, is also claiming that AI was “not a predominant factor” in recent layoffs. Given the types of jobs being targeted by the company — staffers in gaming, where the company is shifting focus for other reasons, and managers whose roles aren’t particularly exposed to current AI tools — this is probably true, narrowly speaking. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t connected. Big tech may be harvesting record profits, but it’s also collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars betting on AI (Microsoft committed to $80 billion in AI-related capital expenditures this fiscal year alone). Microsoft might not be LLMing its current employees out of their jobs today, but it’s making a massive and very public bet on its ability — and the ability of others, using its tools — to do so tomorrow. For now, maybe big tech is just looking for some extra cash for the cause. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: As tech CEOs predict AI will replace humans in just 5 years, this Fortune 500 boss says taking the focus off real people is a ‘recipe for failure’

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. AI is already leaving its mark on corporate America, with tech layoffs hitting 75,000 this year alone as companies prepare for the technology to rival humans in just five years time. While this may fuel dreams of a two-day workweek—or fear an AI-fueled apocalypse—James Zallie, CEO of Fortune 500 food ingredient company Ingredion, has a clear answer: People—and culture—still come first. “If you take your eye off either the customer or the employee and you get very internally focused, it’s a recipe for failure,” said Zallie in an appearance on the Inside the Ice House podcast, hosted by the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. And while Zallie’s $8.7 billion company has embraced technology like AI in part to predict supply chain issues, refine recipe formulations, and keep up with regulations—letting anything distract from people and culture could backfire, the baby boomer said. “I think in society today that if you don’t have a strong culture, your business will suffer. And if you don’t focus on people, you will also,” Zallie added. “People will see through whether you’re really living your values and whether you have a care for people in general.” At a time when some companies like Meta and Target have rolled back DEI initiatives, Ingredion still includes “Everybody Belongs” as one of its five core values. And while serving as CEO is the dream job title for most business leaders, Zallie said in reality, he more so sees his job as a chief clarity officer of sorts—the messenger of what the company is doing—and why. “We in positions of leadership and management have a responsibility and accountability to (employees) to continuously try to figure out on their behalf how they can have fulfilled careers, be motivated,” he said. “I look at my job as CEO as chief clarity officer.” Fortune reached out to Zallie for further comment. While Ingredion has made it clear that people are their priority, other companies are rather confident they can do more with less people. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently said that his $2 trillion company would be shedding members of its corporate workforce thanks to generative AI’s enhanced capabilities. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” Jassy wrote in an internal memo last month. Microsoft has already put some of this into action by laying off 15,000 employees this year alone. And while the company cited the changes as a means to “best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the cuts hint at prioritization of automation. Last year, AI saved the company $500 million in its call center alone, reports Bloomberg. And while some CEOs like Salesforce’s Marc Benioff and Google’s Sundar Pichai have increasingly touted AI automation as somewhat of a flex, its replacement of workers has left many, such as software engineers, feeling helpless. Instead of using layoffs as a means to create a more leaner operation, GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said the wiser move is to double down on talent. “The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,” Dohmke said to The Silicon Valley Girl Podcast late last month. “Because if you 10x a single developer, then 10 developers can do 100x,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Alex Veiga, Associated Press Alex Veiga, Associated Press Leave your feedback U.S. stocks are down in morning trading Friday, pulling the market back from all-time highs, as the Trump administration escalates its tariff threats against Canada. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% a day after setting a record high. The benchmark index is on pace to post its first weekly loss in three weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 279 points, or 0.6%, as of 11:06 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% lower a day after climbing to an all-time high. Both indexes are also headed for weekly losses. Bond yields rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.40%, from 4.34% late Thursday. Trump said in a letter Thursday that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening the rift between the longtime North American allies. The letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March. The move is the latest bid by the White House to use threats of higher tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of securing new trade agreements with countries around the globe, even historically close trading partners like Canada. The administration had initially set Wednesday as a deadline for countries to make deals with the U.S. or face heavy increases in tariffs. But with just two trade deals announced since April, one with the United Kingdom and one with Vietnam, the window for negotiations has been now been extended to Aug. 1. Trump also floated this week that he would impose tariffs of as much as 200% on pharmaceutical drugs and placed a 50% tariff on copper imports, matching the rates charged on steel and aluminum. The initial rollout of Trump’s tariff policies in the spring roiled financial markets. But Wall Street has been relatively stable in recent weeks, with stocks steadily rising to record levels, suggesting the market has mostly adjusted to the unpredictability of Trump’s rapidly shifting tariffs. Trade policy aside, the market is now set to shift at least some of its focus on companies due to report quarterly earnings over the next few weeks. On Friday, Levi Strauss jumped 10.9% after the jeans maker easily beat Wall Street’s sales and profit targets and raised its full-year forecast, despite expecting higher costs from tariffs. PriceSmart climbed 6.6% a day after the warehouse club operator delivered solid third-quarter results and said it’s looking into expanding into Chile. Earnings season shifts into high gear next week with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup among the big banks due to report their results on Tuesday. Wall Street analysts predict that companies in the S&P 500 will deliver 5% growth in second-quarter earnings, according to FactSet. That would mark the lowest rate since the fourth quarter of 2023. Shares in financial sector, health care and communication services companies were the biggest weights on the market Friday. Visa fell 1.5%, Gilead Sciences dropped 3.2% and Meta was 1.8% lower. Some big tech stocks rose. Chimpaker Nvidia was up 1.8%. Several airline stocks were down a day after encouraging quarterly results from Delta Air Lines set off a rally in the sector. Delta dropped 2.4%, United fell 3.9% and American was 4.1% lower. Elsewhere in the market, shares of T-Mobile slipped 0.6% after the Justice Department announced Thursday that it would not prevent the company from closing on its proposed $4.4 billion acquisition of U.S. Cellular. That deal, announced more than a year ago, had come under antitrust scrutiny from the Justice Department under President Joe Biden’s administration. U.S. Cellular shares rose 2.7%. Shares in aviation company Red Cat Holdings jumped 17.8% after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued orders aimed at ramping up production and deployment of drones. European stock indexes were broadly lower following a mostly lower finish in Asian markets. Meanwhile, bitcoin climbed to another all-time high Friday, briefly eclipsing $118,000 before easing back to around $117,800, according to Coindesk. Bitcoin’s price jump came amid bullish momentum across risk assets and coincides with Nvidia’s surge to a $4 trillion valuation. It also comes days before the U.S. Congress’ Crypto Week on July 14, where lawmakers will debate a series of bills that could define the regulatory framework for the industry.

Title: Flagship Will Shutter Its Marketplace, Citing Creator Disinterest

Creator tech firm Flagship quietly revealed it’s shutting down its core ecommerce platform, according to an FAQ initially posted on its website. The final day of sales on the platform is July 16. The company originated with that platform in 2023 and bet that creators would want to curate product recommendations and earn affiliate revenue using its platform. Over the past year, more than 1,000 creators and 500 brands used the Flagship marketplace to drive sales, cofounder and CEO Youssef Ahres told ADWEEK in an email. He added that some creators earned more than $200,000 a year through Flagship. But that wasn’t enough to sustain Flagship’s core platform. “Most creators—even highly effective ones—prefer creating content over running a storefront, and it was harder than expected to get them excited about promoting new or unfamiliar brands,” Ahres, said, adding it was difficult for creators to drive consistent sales. When Flagship launched, it set out to compete with affiliate giants like LTK. The startup is now pivoting its business around an AI-powered search engine connecting brands with creators called Radar. The company’s website was redesigned last week to promote Radar. Ahres did not respond if the pivot will result in layoffs. “We’re committed to building tools that help creators earn from their influence,” said Ahres. Flagship launched in 2023 and raised an undisclosed amount in seed and Series A funding. The company’s investors include VC firms Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures, and both will continue to back the company as it transitions away from its ecommerce platform product, according to Ahres. He did not respond when asked how much Flagship had raised in total. Flagship’s ecommerce platform attracted a community of creators looking to earn affiliate commission outside of Amazon. One such creator is Caroline Moss, the writer and host of the popular shopping newsletter and podcast, Gee Thanks, Just Bought It! Her newsletter and podcast storefront lived on Flagship, and she appeared on Flagship’s website and in promotional videos. Moss announced the shuttering of Flagship on the Gee Thanks Instagram account and expressed her sadness about its closure in a blog post. She praised the platform’s ability to connect her audience to small businesses and wrote, “it gave us a home that aligned with our values.” Moss didn’t respond to ADWEEK’s request for comment. Flagship’s closure hints that startups that specialize in affiliate linking might be under threat as major platforms like TikTok launch their own ecommerce features like TikTok Shop, and integrate Amazon shopping directly into the platforms. While investors’ interest in influencer marketing firms has grown over the past year, marketers increasingly look for more specialized tools that streamline manual processes like ad buying and managing creators. Elena Cavender is ADWEEK's influencer marketing reporter based out of New York City. Previously, she was a technology and culture reporter at Mashable.

US stock market slipped in early trading on July 11, pulling back from record highs as Trump’s tariff threat on Canada spooked investors. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% after hitting a record the previous day, while the Dow Jones dropped 257 points, or 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite was also slightly down by 0.2%. Rising bond yields, with the 10-year Treasury jumping to 4.40%, added to the pressure. As markets react to fresh trade tensions, all three indexes are heading toward their first weekly loss in three weeks. Investors are closely watching Trump’s next move on US-Canada trade.

Title: I'm Done with Social Media
URL: https://www.carolinecrampton.com/im-done-with-social-media/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T15:00:36Z
Full Content:
I started last year with one clear goal: 2024 was going to be the year that I finally did social media. Regular posting, a content calendar, a strategy, a plan for growth — all of that. And yet I ended the year pretty certain that I never wanted to open those apps again, let alone post my photos and words to them. How? My main motivation for wanting to conquer my long-held ambivalence about posting was because I had a book coming out in April 2024. I was very anxious about this, in part because A Body Made of Glass was not an obviously easy sell. There are a few reasons for that: it blends several genres in a hard-to-categorise way, it tackles a subject in which I am not a well-known or previously published expert, and it is highly personal. It had also, in quite a modest way, done well according to the nebulous pre-publication benchmarks that authors obsess over. It had attracted a "Big Five" publisher in the US, something I had not had before, received a BBC radio serialisation deal in the UK, and had received some decent early reviews from industry publications in both places. I felt I should be leaving no stone unturned to support the book's success, since I had been gifted opportunities that many other writers would love to have. Chances, too, that I may never have again. There are very few things that an author can practically do to make a book a success, especially after said book is written, edited and printed. Being a celebrity or personality with a pre-existing audience that adores you definitely helps, but isn't something you can suddenly decide to become four months before your publication date. Catching a particular trend or moment that causes publishers to invest heavily in promotion and booksellers to place large early orders is great too, but once the book is done that's up to them, not you. Giving off that nebulous aura of "I'm about to become a huge literary success" that seems to cling to some people and not others would be good as well, but is also pretty hard to engineer deliberately if that's not your personality or presentation (and it isn't mine). In that tense, quiet period after the book has been finalised but before anyone can buy or read it, augmenting your personal brand via the regular use of social media feels like the only concrete action you can take. Or at least it did to me, so I threw myself into it. I attended some training sessions on "social media for authors". I asked professional acquaintances with expertise for tips. I learned that Instagram and TikTok were the best platforms to target for bookish followers and that the algorithms of these platforms were, these days, only interested in vertical videos. I compiled lists of videos I could make and started filming mostly-daily updates about my experience as an author with a book coming out soon. I scoured the accounts of other authors who were more successful than me on social media for insights. I posted about every tiny bit of publicity my book got or small win I achieved. I asked people to pre-order in as many ways as I could think of. I delved into the analytics, searching for ways to optimise and improve. I spent a lot of time scrolling, and scrolling, and scrolling, hunting for the "one weird trick" that would help me make a success of this. I quickly began to feel quite uncomfortable. I'm not a natural on camera and I don't have that talent for talking effortlessly and engagingly to a lens when alone in a room that successful social media personalities need. I was forcing it all the time, making myself record multiple takes and doing things again and again until they looked "natural" (a highly unnatural behaviour). My video editing skills are basic, so turning out regular videos took me a long time. Worst of all, though, was the way in which this enterprise began to alter my mindset about the normal stuff of life. I never used to think very hard about what I wore for a casual day of writing at home, or worry about how clean the bathroom mirror was, or obsess over what narrative or story might emerge from my general jumble of accumulated tasks. It shocked me how quickly I started viewing my own life as something to film and share, rather than something to just... live. I've seen this effect described as "the devil had taken my eyes" and I feel that is accurate. Something had taken over my gaze and it wasn't something good. A new and sinister lens had appeared between me and the world. One evening, as I made my husband walk our dog past the same scenic view multiple times so that I could get the best shot of it for a video, I experienced a sudden wave of revulsion for myself and what I was doing. From then on, I began to despise the way this supposedly necessary aspect of modern authorship was intruding on parts of me that I had never meant to be available for public consumption. Worst of all, perhaps, it didn't even seem to be doing anything. The TikTok and Instagram algorithms were utterly disinterested in what I was posting. Some of my existing followers saw my videos and interacted with them, but the promise that this kind of regular video posting would expose my work to lots of new potential readers was never fulfilled. Instagram's analytics showed that although I had a couple of thousand followers, only a few hundred of them were even seeing what I was posting. On Twitter, where I had nearly ten thousand followers that had mostly been accumulated during my previous work as a political journalist, the figures were even worse. Most of my TikToks barely made it to views in three figures. Clearly, I was doing it wrong. But how? I couldn't find any answers, although there's a seemingly inexhaustible supply of information out there on this topic. Everyone in this space seemed to publicly agree that "social media was really important for book promotion" and pointed to the viral success of various books on BookTok, but nobody was able to go into more detail about how this was achieved, or if it was even applicable to a non-fiction book by a non-celebrity author. When I tried to explore this world, it seemed to me like the old-fashioned word-of-mouth effect was just being channeled through a new medium. Books mostly weren't gaining momentum on TikTok because their authors were making top notch viral videos, but because readers and bookish influencers were recommending them to each other and posting about their experiences. It was the quality of the book, the canny distribution of advance reading copies and marketing materials by publishers, and the work's ability to speak to a moment that made the difference. I didn't really see how my own social media activities could fit into this ecosystem. People would either find and like the book, or they wouldn't. Did I even need to be there? Every time I posted, I felt worse. From the outside, my attempts to "do" social media seriously probably looked inconsequential, but they consumed a major portion of my thoughts. What I was doing felt inauthentic and, as the book came out and started getting reviews, like boasting for no reason other than to boast. The choppy nature of the algorithms meant that there was no consistent community on these apps with whom I was sharing my progress through the publishing process and no guarantee even that those were interested would see what I was sharing. When I did in-person events about the book and spoke to readers over the signing table, they would tell me that they had come because they had liked my first book, or enjoyed my current podcast, Shedunnit, or had been a fan of my old one, SRSLY. One person drove several hours to see me at a literary festival because I had put a link to the event in a postscript in my sporadic email newsletter. Nobody I met had been motivated by what I had been doing on social media, even though making those posts had been consuming the vast majority of the time and effort I had to devote to book promotion. This is anecdotal data, for sure, but so much of how the success or otherwise of a book is defined is vibes-based that I felt fine about allowing it to inform me. It only backed up what the social media platforms' analytics had been telling me, anyway. By the mid point of last year my book had been out for a couple of months and the expectation to market it as much as possible was dying away. My anxiety simmered down to the point where I could assess matters more objectively. This was situation as I saw it: I had put a lot of work time and mental energy into social media because I had been told by lots of trustworthy sources — like people who worked in publishing, fellow authors and my writers' union — that it was the best way to help my book reach as many interested readers as possible. In fact, my posts had reached very few people and contributed very little to the success of the book. Plus, they were very time consuming to make so had eaten up leisure time and my capacity to do other work. There had also been negative side effects in the form of vastly increased screen time and that disagreeable mental habit of seeing my entire existence as potential posts. There was only one possible conclusion: social media was not for me. More than that, I felt that there was something of an "emperor's new clothes" situation at work. Being a social media star is a skillset completely distinct from being someone who writes books — they may overlap occasionally, but it's not the norm. Yet I suspect that every non-celebrity and midlist author will have felt the pressure at some point to "be more active on social media" because otherwise they aren't "pulling their weight" for their book. I wasn't alone in finding that the effort:reward ratio was entirely out of whack, either. Plenty of peers that I spoke to with online creative businesses were happy to share their experiences of withdrawing partially or fully from social media (for all sorts of reasons including harassment, burnout and parenting) only to find that their sales were largely or even entirely unaffected the next time they had a project to promote. One had closed an account with a following in the six figures and switched to communicating with customers only via an email newsletter, and business was even better than before (likely because all of those subscribed were actually receiving the emails they had signed up for). I began to wonder. Was this all, in fact, nonsense? The publishing industry is going through a period of great volatility at the moment, for many reasons including but not limited to rising production costs, encroaching celebrity culture, corporate greed and the advent of AI. Traditional publicity opportunities like television/radio interviews and print reviews are becoming less and less effective at getting the word out about books as fewer people tune in. The digital alternatives have, so far, not offered a like for like replacement for the old marketing ecosystem. From my perspective as a traditionally-published, non-celebrity author, it feels like nobody really knows what makes a book sell anymore. I think the persistent advice to authors to "do social media" is, at best, part of a strategy that can be generously described as throwing everything at the proverbial wall in the hope that something, anything, will stick. Being more cynical, I think it might sometimes be a way of keeping authors quiet, of transferring the responsibility for their book's success on to their shoulders and occupying them doing something that feels productive so they don't ask too many awkward questions. It's busy work. That's all without considering the role of the platforms themselves in this. I spent several months last year feeling grim about the amount of free content I had uploaded to platforms owned by the likes of Meta and Elon Musk. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok — these are all outlets that purport to capture and manipulate their users' attention, meaning that, as a "creator", if you catch the wave of the algorithm just right you can surf it all the way to a huge following, then fame and fortune. I don't doubt that the select few who make this equation work for them do get well paid for their work once they become successful. Everyone else, though, is just uploading for free so that there is enough stuff on the app to keep users scrolling forever. Infinite scroll means infinite ad inventory. The platforms also invest in promoting the idea that being a "full time creator" is an attainable goal and incentivise their top creators to sell the idea that anyone can achieve their success, if they just start now and work really hard for nothing as long as is necessary. The more I thought about it, the harder it became not to view the so-called creator economy as a blatant pyramid scheme underwritten by some of the worst corporations in the world. The way to succeed is to get in early, then become an aspirational figure to those who come along later. I'm being deliberately blunt to make my point. If you enjoy watching happy videos of dogs and uploading pictures of your holidays for your friends, I'm delighted for you. If making videos and sharing them online is your hobby, all power to you. As part of a viable creative career, though, where a living wage and sustainable workload is the goal, social media now feels to me like a long con that just hasn't been exposed yet. I've never been a whole-hearted lover of social media, nor a great adept at it. I only signed up for Facebook at university because it was necessary for being involved in the student newspaper, and then I deleted my account a few years later when I had a scary experience with a stalker. I rejoined when I moved out of London, naively believing it would help me make new local friends, which it did not. I got Twitter when someone on my journalism training course laughed at me because I didn't already have an account and then almost never posted on it, even when the platform was at its dizzying heights of relevance for those in the media. I once went mildly viral for a snarky tweet during a televised election debate and found the experience so horrifying that I never wanted to repeat it. Instagram was better, for a while — my corner of it was mostly friends and dogs and knitting — but then the feed became algorithmic instead of chronological and I almost never saw the things I liked in a sensible order. Social media was never a wholly cosy or useful place for me, although I was utterly addicted to it for a number of years because "being a journalist" in the 2010s felt synonymous with "being on social media all the time". This idea was so deeply rooted in me that when I worked somewhere with such terrible computers that they couldn't even handle refreshing a Twitter feed, I bought an iPad with my own money so that I could have a device next to me all day that was continually showing the latest posts. At the time, I barely made more than the London Living Wage, rent took three quarters of my monthly pay after tax, and I walked an hour to work every day because I couldn't afford to take the Tube. In those circumstances, buying an expensive tablet just so I never had to be separated from the latest tweets is absurd, even irresponsible. And yet I did it, because I had utterly internalised the idea that social media was the route to writing success. Years later, even knowing what I now knew, it took months to work myself up to quitting and even longer to say out loud what I had done and why. Once I had made up my mind to mentally uncouple myself from social media, it was shockingly easy to do. I deleted the apps from my phone and changed the passwords to my accounts, recording them somewhere inconvenient so that I could log in via the desktop versions if necessary but it took more than a couple of taps or clicks. A few weeks in, I took stock of what I felt like I was missing and the list was surprisingly short: Taylor Swift content, chats with friends, the occasional funny picture of a dog. I replaced all of these pretty easily: I signed up to a couple of music podcasts and Patreons, made an effort to be more regular about phoning and texting people, and just enjoyed the dogs that I saw out and about in the world. The benefits were just as quick to come. That feeling of seeing the world only as potential future content receded, I started reading more books, and my screen time fell drastically. I felt released from a burden I hadn't noticed I was carrying. I had become so accustomed to the sense of shame at not being better at offering up my life for successful consumption that I only realised how acute that feeling had been now that it was gone. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, for someone very influential in my industry to swoop down and reprimand me for my actions, to declare that I had irrevocably failed at "being a writer". But nothing bad happened. At all. Those apps had become so barren of joy or purpose for me that I didn't miss the experience of being on them, either as a creator or a user, at all. By the end of the year, packaging chunks of myself to share on questionable corporate platforms for strangers to watch and judge felt like a really weird thing to do. I talked about it in therapy and imagined trying to explain this practice to my eleven-year-old self who had really wanted to spend her life writing stories. The more time that passes, the odder it feels that I spent a decade and a half of my life believing that social media was a vital part of being a writer. Others may have different experiences, but because I was never a consummate poster I never received work opportunities or made friends or found a partner through these apps. Maybe if I had, I would feel like there had been more of a fair exchange. I just allowed them to occupy a large chunk of my brain for nothing. Where does this leave me? I ended 2024 absolutely sure that social media was not for me, a complete reversal of my position at the start of the year. I'm not moving to the woods and throwing my phone in the bin, though. Beyond the reassuringly steady drip of Taylor Swift videos, there was one overarching benefit to being active on social media as a writer that I want to retain, and that is having a way to be in touch with those who are interested in my work. I've spent most of 2025 so far working out what that might look like. I still like the internet and what it can do for us — quite honestly, I don't think I would have a job at all without it — but I want to use it on my terms and in a way that feels good for me rather than harmful. If that means that my potential audience is much smaller, so be it. After much reflection during, I have come to realise that I'd rather talk to a small number of people and be happy doing it than try to reach a huge audience but be miserable. I started small, making the change for my podcast. I did a "farewell" post on the show's accounts and replaced them with an enhanced email newsletter. I expected some pushback and braced myself for a dip in listenership, which I decided that I was willing to accept as the price I paid for independence and greater peace of mind. Neither materialised. I received lots of supportive messages from people with their own growing reservations about social media. The podcast's newsletter now has more active subscribers than we ever had followers. There has been no discernible fall in audience, vindicating my suspicions that our posts hadn't really been doing anything to direct people away from the apps and towards the podcast anyway. Best of all, I'm enjoying writing to the podcast's listeners every week. I am no longer guiltily pushing the "do podcast social media" tasks to the bottom of my to do list all the time. Taking this step for the podcast first has allowed me to come to some decisions about my personal internet presence, too. I have realised that I only want to post on a platform where I have control, with no algorithms or anything else coming between me and the people who want to see what I'm doing. I'm a writer and I think in paragraphs and chapters, not in videos or captions. I think it's about time I played to my strengths, rather than trying to fit myself into a format that I've never found to be comfortable. So, I decided to add a blog to my website and that will now be my home on the internet[1]. I gave it a tagline that hopefully reflects this new stage of my online life: "A blog by a writer attempting to live the literary good life on the internet". Because that's what I'm trying to do now. The quality of the life now is more important than any potential reward in the future. Although the blog will be the main home for all my stuff (you can follow it via RSS and I think you should, because RSS is possibly the best and purest tech we still have) I'll still be sending some posts out as newsletters too. Personal essays where I think out loud (like this one), my Thursday links round up, reading reflections, and a new series I'm about to start titled "Caroline Writes a Novel" (!). Because lots of people have been in touch to say they miss the photos of my dog I used to post on Instagram, there will be a sporadic "photo diary" mail out too where Morris will feature heavily. If you'd like to receive those you can sign up here, or if you already subscribe you can use this menu to adjust which types of posts you receive. I have no plans at the moment to put up a paywall or make extra premium content, but I do have the subscription feature turned on so if anyone really wants to make a financial contribution, they can. I must stress that you won't receive any extra material or benefits if you do so. For now, this is a Medici-style "patron of the arts" situation. Everything is free for everyone, supported by those who have the means and desire to do so. I also want to stress that I absolutely do not need your contributions for basic necessities or survival — this is just a way for those who can to support work that they like if they so choose. There's also an option for a one-off tip if you feel inclined to give one. You should feel no pressure or obligation to do so, though. If you're more into a "extra content for a fee" model, then you might want to consider joining the paid membership element of my podcast. If all of this — a non-famous writer with a podcast deciding she's replacing Instagram with blogging — feels too inconsequential to write 4,500 words about, then you're not alone. I think so too, but I also couldn't not write this. In fact, I've been tapping away at a draft of this post for months, trying to get my feelings about it straight. I might be well on the way to breaking the habit of reflexively viewing the world around me as possible nuggets of content, but even after the somewhat bruising experience of putting out two autobiographical books, I still think best with my fingers on a keyboard and a publication date in mind. In this instance, I do feel like I'm answering a question nobody has asked, though. I think quite regularly about the, at the time very funny, ebook that Grace Dent published in 2011 titled How to Leave Twitter: My Time as Queen of the Universe and Why This Must Stop, in which she lampooned her own social media addiction and the absurd phenomenon of too-online people with tiny followings grandiloquently announcing that they wouldn't be online for the next three hours. What is this, if not that? It feels fitting, though, to mark the end of this chapter in a needlessly performative way. Even though I was terrible at posting, I did spend fifteen years watching human behaviour evolve on these platforms. It was bound to rub off on me a bit. I still don't know if I will delete my old social media accounts. I want to, because it feels more final that way, more like a definitive statement about who I am now and what I am doing. Maybe that's why I shouldn't, though. That was a version of me too, the one who agonised over every angle and caption, who couldn't see the light hitting the water just so without imagining Instagram's square frame around it, who believed that all her dreams would come true if she could just crack Meta's code. She was trying her best, just like I am now. She can live on as a ghost in that machine for now, a bodiless reminder of an existence I never really had. For those who might be wondering why I'm not starting a Substack, it's because I don't like Substack as a company or the direction their platform seems to be headed in (I was there for Facebook's "pivot to video" and I remember who it screwed over). I'm using Ghost, a non-profit website and newsletter platform, and I'm very happy with it. I'd highly recommend it. ↩︎

The high-speed cables market is expected to reach US$12.90 billion by 2024 from US$24.99 billion in 2031, at a CAGR of 10.2% during the forecast period 2025-2031. The demand for high-performance, reasonably priced data center interconnects has increased as cloud services grow at a never-before-seen rate. High-speed cables have become more widely used as a result of this. To explore the valuable insights in the High Speed Cables Market report, you can easily download a sample PDF of the report – https://www.theinsightpartners.com/sample/TIPRE00025895/ High-speed cables such as DAC and AOC offer a direct physical layer connection between two ports utilizing twin-axial cables, guaranteeing signal integrity across predetermined lengths without the use of active optical components, in contrast to optical interconnects that rely on optical modules for signal conversion. The electronics, automotive, communication, and networking industries are continuously evolving by innovating their product offerings to support high speed data transfer. Thus, a rising demand for high speed cables to facilitate easy connectivity is propelling the market growth. Automotive manufacturers are installing more electronic and infotainment systems in vehicles to provide high connectivity. The report runs an in-depth analysis of market trends, key players, and future opportunities. In general, the High Speed Cables are applicable in a vast array of applications that are expected to register strength during the coming years. For Detailed High-Speed Cables Market Insights, Visit: https://www.theinsightpartners.com/reports/high-speed-cable-market Overview of Report Findings Rising Investments in Enterprise IT Infrastructure: Rising enterprise IT infrastructure investments are directly fueling demand for high-speed interconnects such as AECs (Active Electrical Cables), AOCs (Active Optical Cables), and DACs (Direct Attach Copper). The need for quicker, more dependable, and more efficient data transfer across servers, switches, and storage systems has increased as businesses update their data centers and implement cutting-edge technologies such as edge computing, hybrid cloud, and AI/ML workloads. As businesses grow to 25G, 100G, and 400G Ethernet infrastructures, these high-speed cables are crucial for providing the low-latency and high-throughput connectivity needed by today's enterprise applications. For instance, over 40% of larger enterprises will adopt edge computing as part of their IT infrastructure by 2025, as it enables real-time analytics for smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and industrial IoT. Developments in 5G Network Services: Passive DACs, which are basically premium copper wires without any embedded electronics, are far less expensive than the cables due to these components. Advanced chipsets in AECs and VCSEL lasers in AOCs add a premium that can increase the cost by at least two to five times. DACs are frequently utilized in 5G networks for short-range connections that occur in the same area, such as O-RAN cell sites and edge data centers. These cables support high-speed data transport with low latency and power consumption. For instance, passive QSFP28 DACs are appropriate for in-cabinet direct connections since they can support 100 Gb/s, while SFP28 DACs can support 25 Gb/s. The dense cells and high traffic of 5G networks necessitate backhaul connections capable of handling hundreds of gigabits. This necessitates greater speed Ethernet connections, such as 400G or greater. DACs are essential in order to facilitate these high-speed Ethernet connections across short distances and guarantee effective data transfer between network devices. The lowest power consumption per port is also provided by passive DACs, which use between 91% and 97% less power per port than fiber cabling with independent transceivers. The volume of short-reach server network access connections quickly mounts up.

Good morning. It's the last day of Amazon's Prime Day sale, so time is running out to snag some of the best deals of the summer. The Reviews team at BI has gathered the best discounts for your home, kitchen, closet, and more — and they've tested all the items, too. In today's big story, welcome to the age of office paranoia, where layoffs, AI, and job insecurity are terrorizing workers. What's on deck: Markets: JPMorgan says retail investors will lead a stock-buying spree in the second half of 2025. Tech: A new city is vying to steal San Francisco's Big Tech crown. Business: Dear Starbucks, please don't force baristas to write on cups. But first, we need to talk. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. They think they're next. The company snacks are worse. The office air conditioning goes out. An unexpected meeting appeared on your calendar. The signs all point toward one thing: looming layoffs. Or not. Sometimes, things are just as mundane as they appear. It's what experts call "paranoid attribution," when employees read negative meaning into regular workplace occurrences. It's occurring in workforces across America. It's not hard to understand why: AI is threatening to take jobs, strict RTO orders are becoming more common, and the Great Flattening is coming for middle management. "Workers are feeling disempowered," said Michele Williams, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Iowa. "They're looking for these social cues and overinterpreting social cues because of that insecurity." Meanwhile, the reality is that layoff rates are still low — relative to historic levels — and remain concentrated in white-collar sectors, especially at big-name companies that dominate headlines. In other words, things may not be as bad as they seem. But the paranoia is still reshaping the workplace. The fear isn't good for anyone, BI's Juliana Kaplan writes. When employees are anxious about their career security, they probably aren't doing their best work. One worker that BI spoke with has completely changed her perspective on her career after getting laid off twice in two years. The first time was the day that she had arranged a return-to-office party for the workers reporting to her. "It's really hard to go to work every day and to know that you may not have a future here no matter how hard you work," she said. On the other hand, fear can be terribly efficient. When companies shift toward a more "hardcore" management style, they are generally banking on employees clinging to well-worn adages about becoming indispensable at work. Employees were supposed to become hyper-focused, not hyper-concerned. Now, staffers are looking at the corporate world a little differently — and some are turning their back on it altogether. Last chance of the year to observe "Manhattanhenge," when the sun sets in perfect alignment with the Manhattan street grid. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: TikTok poached Amazon employees to jump-start its US business. Now it's doubling down on its Chinese roots.

"Always day 1" is one of six core cultural principles at TikTok. The slogan, meant to inspire agility and urgency, might sound familiar. It was coined by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Business principles aren't the only thing TikTok has taken from Amazon. When TikTok officially launched its e-commerce platform Shop in the US in 2023, it went on a hiring spree, poaching dozens of Amazon staffers to work in its Bellevue, Washington, offices, located a few blocks from some Amazon offices. By the end of 2024, TikTok had 1,700 employees there, according to the city's estimates. So many TikTok Shop employees came from Amazon that its early staff meetings sometimes felt like Amazon alumni reunions, current and former staffers told Business Insider. "It was Amazon left, right, and center," said one employee who came from Amazon. Another ex-Amazonian estimated that 75% of their 2023 TikTok Shop orientation group had previously worked at the e-commerce giant. Amazon showed up in operations, too. TikTok team members routinely shared insights about Amazon's business strategies, sometimes walking through documents taken directly from their former employer, two current staffers and one former TikTok staffer said. And just like at Amazon, employees crafted narrative memos to share products or ideas and allocated dedicated time for people to read them. Some tried to infuse TikTok with other Amazon strategies like customer obsession or single-person ownership of projects from start to finish. TikTok didn't want to be exactly like Amazon — its secret sauce was its social app with popular videos and an influencer network. But it really wanted Amazon's brand partners, and to replicate the customer shopping experience that had turned Amazon into a $2 trillion behemoth. Amazon controls about 40% of the total US e-commerce market, which could cross $100 billion in 2026, according to EMARKETER. If TikTok could peel away even a small percentage of customers, the opportunity would be huge. In some ways, TikTok never fully embraced a local-first approach to the US market. Despite hiring so many people in the US, its key e-commerce leaders continued to largely direct the business from China and Singapore. Then, last year, the US team began to fall short of its goals. Chinese leadership at ByteDance, TikTok's owner, began stripping some US executives' autonomy through changes to their reporting structures. A parade of US team managers left the company, and in their place, TikTok's parent company installed new leaders who weren't tapped into the Amazon playbook. Gone are the days of draining knowledge from America's most iconic e-commerce retailer. TikTok Shop leaders are focused on a different North Star: its Chinese sister app, Douyin. The changes on the Shop team mirror a broader shift within TikTok, which, even as it seeks an American buyer, has given more strategic power to leaders from China and Singapore. Some TikTok insiders feel the shift was inevitable. ByteDance leaders "weren't willing to listen to what strategies worked for Amazon that were relevant for TikTok," a former Shop staffer who worked with sellers said. They said leaders had a fixation on livestream selling — a big sales driver in China that did not translate as successfully to the US market. Leadership wanted "US representation and experience, but they didn't want to take a US strategy," this person continued. "It was a constant struggle between 'copy Amazon' and 'copy Douyin,'" a second former Shop worker said. TikTok and Amazon did not provide comment on this story. In 2023, TikTok recruited Nicolas Le Bourgeois, a nine-year Amazon veteran, to run TikTok Shop's US operations. Other Amazonians soon joined TikTok to boost sales in key product categories and staff roles like seller relationships, trust and safety, governance, operations, and logistics. Like Amazon, TikTok launched its own "Fulfilled by TikTok" business in 2023. It pushed sellers to ship products to US customers faster and established six US warehouses by October 2024, Le Bourgeois told BI last year. Amazon wasn't the only company where TikTok Shop sourced talent, but it was a big focus. The company hired people who had relationships with "US brands, heritage brands, household names, because they wanted us to basically convince those brands to get on platform," the former staffer who worked with sellers said. Some team members studied Amazon's product pages, its checkout process, and other core elements of its shopping experience. By early 2024, TikTok seemed to be making progress. Despite some users grumbling about seeing too many e-commerce videos, it was making strides in key metrics like customer retention. Some brands were reporting seven-figure hauls from TikTok Shop livestreams. But executives at ByteDance weren't happy. The app's sales were minuscule compared to Douyin, a dominant player in China that drives hundreds of billions in annual sales there. Bob Kang, ByteDance's e-commerce leader, called out the US team for missing 2024 goals in a February 2025 all-hands. The company was struggling with recruiting those "household name" brands in some product categories, and instead finding a lot more success with smaller sellers, often based out of China. ByteDance leadership began removing power from local US leaders in 2024, current and former staffers said. Then came a series of restructurings, two rounds of layoffs, and review-cycle exits over the first half of 2025. Many of the early ex-Amazon workers exited, replaced by executives with expertise working on Douyin. In April, Le Bourgeois was moved under former Douyin executive Mu Qing, no longer reporting directly to Kang. The next month, Le Bourgeois left the company, according to an internal memo viewed by BI. Le Bourgeois did not respond to a request for comment. With Le Bourgeois gone, one staffer said it's become harder for US employees to communicate with ByteDance leadership. ByteDance leaders are now betting TikTok Shop's future on leaders with Douyin expertise. Douyin's e-commerce business is a crown jewel for ByteDance, and replicating its strategies in the US and other markets could pay off big if the rest of the world follows Chinese consumers in embracing social shopping. As TikTok Shop expands into additional markets, it's running many operations centrally out of China and Singapore. In April, the company heavily restructured its moderation team in Latin America to give control to Chinese and Singaporean leaders rather than local managers, according to an internal memo viewed by BI. In May, it flew Chinese staffers to São Paulo to support the rollout of TikTok Shop in Brazil. The company's swing back to its Chinese roots in the US may seem counterintuitive, as TikTok's ties to China prompted a 2024 US law that requires it to divest from its owner. But TikTok does not appear to be under imminent danger of shutting down; Trump has extended its divestment deadline three times since January. And TikTok may soon separate its US users into a country-specific app, The Information reported. The road ahead for TikTok Shop, as it faces business and political obstacles, will require embodying the "always day 1" agility the company lists as a core principle. After months of leadership changes, TikTok Shop is grappling with volatile sales in 2025 amid Trump's tariffs on China and the removal of a key import exemption, BI previously reported. While weekly order volume slumped in May compared to April after tariffs went into effect, the company wrote in a blog post last month that platform sales were up 120% year-over-year for the first two weeks of June. ByteDance is betting it can meet its e-commerce ambitions by leaning heavily on the expertise that made Douyin a leader in China. Some insiders say this could risk missing the US market nuances that local e-commerce workers might more easily spot. In many ways, they never committed to a local US strategy, the third staffer said. "It has always been 'rebuild Douyin' for the western market." Jump to

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: AMD Stock Popped After Analyst Said New AI Chips Could Take On Nvidia’s—Watch These Key Price Levels

Time Published: 2025-07-11T14:15:48Z

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock jumped Thursday after analysts suggested the company’s latest AI chips could take on Nvidia's (NVDA) offerings. Analysts at HSBC said AMD’s MI350 series chips are comparable with Nvidia’s current Blackwell chips and next generation MI400 chips, due for release next year, could compete with Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin platform. AMD shares trade 86% above their early April low and have gained 18% since the start of the year as of Thursday’s close. However, they have significantly unperformed Nvidia’s shares over the past 12 months due to the company’s inability to capture a greater share of the booming AI chip market. Below, we take a closer look at AMD’s chart and use technical analysis to identify crucial price levels that investors should keep an eye on. Since bottoming in early April, AMD shares have traded higher in an orderly uptrend. More recently, the price broke out from a flag pattern in Thursday’s trading session on the highest volume in a little over a week, potentially signaling a continuation of the stock’s recent move higher. In another win for the bulls, the 50-day moving average (MA) continues to converge up toward the 200-day MA, setting the stage for a golden cross signal. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum, sitting just below the indicator’s overbought threshold. Let’s identify two crucial overhead areas on AMD’s chart that could attract interest if the shares continue to track higher and also locate several vital support levels worth monitoring during future pullbacks in the stock. The first overhead area to watch sits around $175. This price point could provide resistance near prominent countertrend peaks that formed on the chart in May and October last year. This level is also near a bars pattern target that preceded the flag and overlays it from the pattern’s breakout point. Such a move would complete a classic Elliot Wave pattern, with five distinct swings playing out. Buying above this area could see the shares climb towards $215. Investors who have accumulated the stock at lower prices may decide to lock in profits at this level just below the stock’s notable March 2024 top marked by a textbook shooting star candlestick pattern. During pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth monitoring the $135 level. The shares could find solid buying interest at this price near the low of the flag pattern, which sits on a horizontal line extending back to last September. Finally, a deeper retracement in AMD shares could see the price revisit a lower support around $115.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/DV or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: How to Survive a Million-Dollar Loss
URL: https://www.practicalecommerce.com/how-to-survive-a-million-dollar-loss
Time Published: 2025-07-11T12:25:15Z
Full Content:
This year I’ve sprinkled occasional “Ecommerce Conversations” episodes with real-life master classes from Beardbrand, my company. To date I’ve addressed hiring, branding, profit-building, priority-setting, and exiting. For this installment, I’ll share Beardbrand’s experience of losing nearly $1 million across 2023 and 2024. I’ll recap how we managed to survive our worst years in business while remaining 100% bootstrapped. It got bad. Our cash levels dropped to where they were in year one, 2014. We were hemorrhaging money. But we’re still here — still building and still learning. We made it through without outside funding. Here’s what the future holds for Beardbrand. My entire audio dialog is embedded below. The transcript is condensed and edited for clarity. A big portion of our loss came from Target. The company had been a seven-figure account for us for years, and we thought the relationship was solid. Every year, we pitched Target our plans. Historically, the staff there provided us with clear feedback — what worked, what didn’t, and where there was room for growth. In 2023, Target had a sustainability initiative. We revamped our packaging, switching from glass and plastic to aluminum. It’s lighter, more recyclable, and aligns with eco-conscious goals. At the same time, we increased the size of our beard oil packaging from 1 oz. bottles to occupy more shelf space and stand out. We committed early, produced inventory, and delivered Target’s purchase orders on time. Then silence. Nothing. After years of working with us, the staff ghosted us. No feedback, no responses. Worse, they dropped us and left us with nearly $200,000 of unpaid product. We erred by giving Target exclusivity, which meant we weren’t selling on Amazon or Walmart. That killed our ability to move leftover inventory quickly when they dropped us. By the time we finally got on Amazon, the products had already aged out. We destroyed a large quantity that had expired. We’ve always run Beardbrand conservatively. That means keeping a decent amount of capital in reserve — not because we’re paranoid, but because you never know when a black swan event might hit. Having that runway lets you make clear, intentional decisions rather than panicking. It gives you time to explore solutions, test channels, and get a better night’s sleep. Thankfully, during our stronger years, we built up a solid cushion. And that cushion is what kept us afloat during the downturn. We essentially burned through all of it. But we never dipped below zero, which meant we didn’t have to take out high-interest loans, open lines of credit, or bring in outside investors. We did have conversations just in case. I even considered withdrawing money from my personal savings. But that’s a hard decision when things aren’t going well. When you’re in the middle of the storm, it doesn’t feel like a temporary dip — it feels like a freefall. You start wondering: Is this the bottom, or is there more pain ahead? Writing another personal check to the business, especially after years of building wealth from it, was not something I wanted to do. And neither did my partners. We were determined to find a way forward that didn’t involve doubling down with personal capital or giving up control. In addition to losing Target, we experienced a series of setbacks. First, the state of Texas audited us. We cooperated fully, waited for the final numbers, and instead got slapped with a tax lien. That lien triggered Brex, our corporate credit card provider, to freeze our account, despite our perfect payment history. Thankfully, American Express stood by us and kept things moving. Then came an ADA lawsuit, a leaked 100% off coupon code, and a $20,000 air conditioner repair at our barbershop. We also faced regulatory changes that forced us to reformulate key fragrances. We had internal missteps, such as losing a key growth team member and coasting when we should’ve pushed harder. We focused on profitability, but the business slowly declined. We simplified our product line to meet a manufacturer’s needs, which, in hindsight, proved to be a mistake. The lesson? Partner with vendors who value your business. You don’t want to be too small to matter, or too big to be managed. That relationship needs to be just right. We also lowered prices to drive volume, but it backfired. Loyal customers just paid less, and those who thought we were expensive still did. Meanwhile, larger packaging reduced purchase frequency, and killing off beloved fragrances hurt loyalty. Top-line revenue got cut in half. Furthermore, when your business shrinks, fixed costs such as office leases and payroll can become overwhelming. Our $10,000 per month lease that once felt small became a big deal. The good news? Beardbrand is alive. We’ve weathered the storm and slowly started turning things around. It hasn’t been a dramatic rebound — it’s been steady, slow progress. We have focused on improving operations, addressing inventory issues, resolving stock-outs, tightening pricing, and enhancing product quality. We now have the right fulfillment provider, manufacturing partners, and systems in place. Instead of existential crises, we’re dealing with everyday stuff — shipping issues, ad performance, and the occasional bad product batch. That’s a massive shift. It’s not glamorous, but it’s no longer a matter of survival. We cut costs aggressively — even eliminating $15 per month software. We reestablished healthy margins. Our customer service, returns, and product quality all depend on having room to breathe financially. The Target fallout is behind us, the tax lien is resolved, and the ADA plaintiff dropped the bogus lawsuit. My business partner stepped out of day-to-day operations, and some team members transitioned to part-time roles, which helped improve our cash flow. We’ve managed all of this without layoffs. My team is the same one that helped us grow, and they’re still incredibly talented and dedicated. I’ve also cut my own salary and lived off personal savings to keep things afloat. But I’m optimistic. With the business stabilizing, we can rebuild our savings and start exploring new growth opportunities again. July 30, 2021 Survival mode means focusing on making it through the day. Some entrepreneurs try to grow their way out of problems. For us, it started with stabilizing operations. We can finally think long-term again. We’ve begun reinvesting in growth, supporting our paid media and Meta efforts, and expanding our creative team to produce more content and ads. More creative output means more chances to connect with customers and fuel a rebound. We’re also rethinking channels beyond direct-to-consumer. Target was a strong retail partner for years. Retail as a channel still holds potential — perhaps it’s independent salons, boutique pharmacies, and grocery stores. The goal is to diversify. Beardbrand.com will always be our home base, but we’re a business that sells to people, not just an ecommerce brand. It’s exciting to think ahead instead of looking back. We’re aiming for 7% profitability this year — that’s breakeven in my book. It provides us with a buffer for unpredictable events, such as lawsuits, audits, and air conditioning failures. The real goal is 17% profit — that’s when we can fund growth, hire employees, and breathe easier. Anything beyond that is the sweet spot where the stress and sacrifice start to feel worth it. I’m excited again — for the team, for the future, and what we’re building. Share this article: Copyright © 2005 - 2025. Practical Ecommerce® is a registered trademark of Confluence Distribution, Inc.

US stock market futures fell after President Donald Trump announced a 35% tariff on Canada, starting August 1, intensifying global trade concerns. Despite positive earnings from companies like Delta and Levi Strauss, investor sentiment weakened as Trump warned of more tariffs on key trading partners including the EU, Japan, and Brazil. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures slipped by 0.6% or more early Friday. Meanwhile, all eyes are on next week's CPI data and Q2 earnings from major banks. Oil prices ticked higher on Russia sanction talks, but growth worries persist. This evolving trade agenda has markets on edge.

Title: There’s a rumor that Jeff Bezos will ‘buy’ Conde Nast for Lauren Sanchez

Full Content:
For weeks now, people have theorized about Anna Wintourâs sudden decision to step down as editor-in-chief of American Vogue. Considering her decision came right around Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchezâs wedding – and Laurenâs digital Vogue cover – many people (including me) connected the two. I theorized that Wintour felt forced into putting Lauren on the cover in some way, and she basically had enough and perhaps rage-quit that bitch. But what if it was much more complicated than that? This week, the Daily Mail had an odd exclusive – thereâs a theory being bandied around the media world that Bezos will soon purchase Conde Nast as a âgiftâ for Lauren. Bezos already owns the Washington Post, and perhaps he wants to âgiveâ Vogue to Lauren? Fashion ‘bible’ Vogue could soon be owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, sources say. Staff are convinced the world’s fourth-richest man is preparing to buy parent company Conde Nast as a wedding gift for his bride Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist. Many believe it’s no coincidence that the new Mrs Bezos is this month’s digital Vogue cover star and graces its pages wearing a Dolce & Gabbana wedding gown hand-picked by Dame Anna Wintour. Last month Dame Anna announced she was stepping down as Vogue Editor-in-Chief after 37 years in the role but remains in control of global operations. The Newhouse family, who have owned Conde Nast since 1959 and continue to hold it privately under their media empire Advance Publications, insist their titles are not on the market. And last night, a source close to Mr Bezos said it was ‘totally untrue’ that he was considering buying Conde Nast. But with a recent swathe of global redundancies and UK staff now operating from an uninspiring WeWork space near Waterloo station â after Vogue’s Hanover Square HQ was sold â not everyone is convinced. A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The rumour that Jeff is going to buy Conde Nast is all anyone’s talking about in the fashion industry and inside Vogue. Lauren Sanchez is such an unlikely cover star, and the word is that she landed the July issue partly because the Newhouse family want to butter up Bezos. In New York they’re slimming down the business which is exactly what companies do before a sale.’ The source added: ‘Anna is said to be the one brokering the deal so that’s why Lauren was put on the cover. Anna has equity in the business so has a lot to gain from a sale.’ Mr Bezos is no stranger to publishing. In 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million in cash, ending the Graham family’s four-generation ownership. Another source said: ‘He’s one of the very few people with deep enough pockets. And Lauren is no airhead. She’s a sharp cookie. There have been conversations.’ Insiders say several clues point to something big in the offing. Natalia Gamero Del Castillo, MD of Vogue’s European operations, suddenly ‘disappeared’ from the office last week, prompting her colleagues to suggest she had either quit or fallen victim to the global redundancy drive. The source added: ‘There have been redundancies almost every week in Europe and New York. The UK has had a whole round too. ‘What they’re doing is aligning every publication globally so the structure is uniform across all titles. Anna was the anomaly, she was the only Editor-in-Chief left. GQ has a Global Editorial Director, Glamour has one, Vanity Fair too. So she had to give up the title. I don’t think she was thrilled but she accepted it, probably because she knows the company is getting ready to sell. She still has huge influence but she’s no longer Editor-in-Chief. That title is gone. They’re streamlining everything. Either we’re about to go under or we’re being sold. But something is up and everyone’s talking about Bezos.’ [From The Daily Mail] Unlike most of the Mailâs unhinged reporting, I actually think there could be something here, regardless of the denials from Bezosâ camp. When you think about it, Conde Nast would be something which would interest Bezos, especially as a âgiftâ for Lauren. That being said, the Conde Nast layoffs and streamlining are mostly about the death of print media. Conde Nast is taking a lot of losses and they have been for years. Whichâ¦ makes them ripe for a buyout from a deep-pocketed billionaire. Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos essentially rented out Venice and likely paid celebrities to attend their wedding festivities.

No. If the economy really tanks, he isn’t as wealthy as people assume he is because most of his wealth is tied to the stockmarket and most of his products aren’t essential and are obtainable from other sources. How many businesses can he have with the intent of losing money? WAPO was calculated to some extent because he was buying his piece of the president/politics. (Doubtful he thought an organized boycott would take place and he would lose millions though). If he buys CN he will lose big money because he is approaching Muskrat levels of brand toxicity. The idea of Lauren’s blow-up doll tackiness being further normalized is disheartening . Rich people have completely lost the f#cking plot.

Title: 8BitDo updates its fantastic phone controller with an Xbox-inspired design

Daryl Baxter Published: Jul 11, 2025 Another week means another Xbox partnership, this time with 8BitDo. So far this year, we've seen Microsoft work with manufacturers like Backbone and Meta, as well as with Asus for its upcoming Xbox handheld. We're definitely in a transition of seeing Xbox branch out beyond just its consoles and Game Pass offerings, but now it's 8BitDo's moment. Having released its mobile controller for iPhone and Android devices in October last year, you can now buy an Xbox Edition of the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller, which also comes with some software updates. Available now via Amazon for $49.99, the Xbox Edition of the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller comes in black or white and can fit most Apple iPhones and Android devices. Instead of slotting these phones into a USB-C port, the controller connects to them via Bluetooth, so the controller can also connect to your Apple Mac or Windows PC. The triggers and joysticks have been upgraded to be Hall effect, meaning they'll be more precise and more reliable over long periods. However, as this is Xbox-branded, there's a dedicated Xbox button that brings up its Cloud Gaming service when pressed, instead of 8BitDo's native app. It's another extension of Xbox's 'Play Anywhere' ethos, bringing another option to Xbox fans with the best gaming phones. As an owner of an 8BitDo Pro 2 Controller for several years, which is now paired to my Nintendo Switch 2, I've always found the peripherals to be great. From the designs to the long-lasting battery, I've never had an issue with 8BitDo. It was a natural step for the company to bring out a mobile controller last year for iPhone and Android devices. While I use a Backbone One Halo Edition controller for my iPhone 15 Pro Max, I'd definitely consider 8BitDo's take if it ever gave up the ghost. With Backbone's Halo Edition controller and the Meta Quest 3 Xbox Edition, it's yet another effort from Microsoft to reassure customers that its gaming business is here to stay, despite recent layoffs that have led to the cancellation of games like the Perfect Dark reboot and Everwild, as well as the shutting down of some studios. Still, we'll be more convinced when we finally get our hands on the much-anticipated new Fable game. If you've been an Xbox fan since the early days and want to have something that fits with your smartphone when playing games like Fortnite and PUBG Mobile, the Xbox Edition of 8BitDo's Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller will be a great option. In the meantime, check out our guides to the best gaming tablets and the best mobile controllers if you're thinking of an upgrade for both.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) AES Corp.(NYSE:AES) is not usually a stock that makes headlines for significant price fluctuations, but investors were startled this week when it increased almost 20% in just one session on Wednesday. So, what is the reason for this sudden interest? It all comes down to discussions of a potential acquisition. As per reports from Bloomberg and other outlets, AES is reportedly considering strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the company. Such news typically captures investors' attention—particularly when major players like Blackstone, Brookfield, and BlackRock’s infrastructure division are speculated to be involved. While AES stock has experienced volatility, if you're looking for upside with less risk than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. However, this is not solely about merger and acquisition speculation. AES has a significant role in the clean energy transition, providing renewable energy to major tech firms such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. With the demand for energy from AI data centers and cloud computing soaring, AES's assets appear much more valuable. Despite recently encountering challenges—like reduced subsidies for renewable initiatives due to changing U.S. policies—the long-term demand narrative remains strong. In essence, merger chatter + AI-driven energy demand = investor enthusiasm. Regardless of whether the buyout rumors materialize or not, AES has just reminded the market that it might deserve a closer examination. Not fond of the unpredictable nature of AES stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What is the reason for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have offered superior returns with less risk when compared to the benchmark index; a smoother experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Going cheap on AI talent is no way to achieve leadership: Let’s learn from Meta

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. With Meta offering up to $100 million as sign-up bonuses to hire artificial intelligence (AI) talent, it has set the new global price of intelligence. Across the US and China, compensation for top talent in AI, quantum computing and other strategic technologies has decoupled entirely from traditional salary frameworks. What was once considered an executive-level package is now being paid to domain specialists, engineers and scientists. In India, we speak confidently of becoming global champions in AI, semiconductors and battery innovation. But are we ready to pay for the talent required to get us there? Also Read: Star chase: Why Mark Zuckerberg is deploying billions to acquire hot AI talent like Alexandr Wang for Meta Corporate India, particularly its promoter-led enterprises, still has a rigid compensation culture. Even the most admired Indian tech companies rarely exceed $1 million in fixed compensation for high-end domain talent, preferring to offer stock or deferred incentives instead. Across the board, executive pay continues to outpace technical pay by a wide margin—even in companies that market themselves as product-first. Imagine a promoter approving even a tenth of Meta’s figure—say, $10 million annually—for a single hire in AI. HR would instinctively reach for the cost-to-company (CTC) template. Legal teams would load the contract with clawbacks and non-competes. And someone around the table would inevitably ask whether this was more than the entire tech team earns. This reflects a discomfort with the idea that a young knowledge-led mind—often without pedigree, polish or deference—could command industrial-level value. It is a problem of culture. Indian businesses have long been comfortable investing $50 million in a new factory or plant. But offering even $5 million to a knowledge architect who can design the core of a future-facing product feels excessive. This inversion, where management is rewarded more than the minds building the product, is one of Indian technology’s least acknowledged handicaps. It’s not because the talent doesn’t exist. India continues to produce some of the best AI researchers, quantum physicists and deep tech engineers in the world. But our systems expect them to settle for prestige, purpose or passion. Also Read: Siddharth Pai: India’s IT firms have a unique opportunity in AI’s trust deficit There’s a persistent myth that because India’s tech talent is “mission-driven" and that it will accept under-compensation in return for vision or national pride. That might work if you’re a global frontrunner offering unmatched exposure. But when that same talent has offers from research labs in Silicon Valley, Zurich or Singapore—with salaries 8 to 100 times higher—purpose alone won’t bridge the gap. Vision must be paired with valuation: Across the world, many governments and corporations understand this. The UAE has appointed a minister for AI. Singapore offers co-funded AI fellowships with public-private partnerships. Germany’s AI strategy includes billions in subsidies tied to industrial research teams. These are economic bets on the future of productivity. India’s response so far has been largely declarative: strategies, mission and some funding. But talent doesn’t read these documents. It reads offers, options and opportunities. Also Read: Manu Joseph: Why nobody talks about India’s ‘brain drain’ anymore There is precedent for bold compensation in India’s business history. Two decades ago, during the retail boom, one of India’s largest conglomerates hired 15-plus marquee CEOs at salaries reportedly several times higher than their previous pay. It was a bold bet—one that catalyzed knowledge transfer, global systems and new processes. But once the infrastructure was built, the appetite for such talent faded. The notion that talent is fungible took root again. In deep tech sectors, that assumption won’t hold. In the technology era, talent must be treated as strategic capital expenditure. Hiring a world-class AI researcher is like the first kilometre of pipeline in a new industrial system. Yet, most Indian promoters would find it ego-challenging to write that check unless the individual’s value could be directly tied to revenues already realized, or probably the talent is in their bloodline. That mindset is precisely what could cost us the future. Also Read: Beware India Inc., headhunters are poaching your talent for themselves It’s no longer sufficient to celebrate Indian-origin AI leaders at DeepMind, Google or OpenAI. If we underpay the very talent we claim to revere, we aren’t reversing brain drain—we’re subsidizing innovation elsewhere. And the problem runs deeper than compensation structures. Indian business culture still places enormous symbolic value on control, lineage and loyalty. It’s far more comfortable rewarding long-term insiders than investing aggressively in external experts. But deep tech respects none of these traditional codes. It rewards only edge. The question is not whether India has the financial bandwidth but whether it has the emotional maturity to accept that true capability may reside in those who don’t conform to existing hierarchies. Even India’s startup ecosystem hasn’t escaped this gravity. Founders flush with venture capital hesitate to offer globally competitive salaries to specialist talent. Many prefer to overhire generalists rather than back one game-changing domain expert. Performance-linked employee stock options are useful but they’re no substitute for upfront recognition of value. The test of the new economy is not regulation, nor market access. It isn’t equity capital either—these are traditional entry barriers that large Indian firms are comfortable overcoming. The real question is whether they can recognize that in a world of knowledge-driven industries, intellect is infrastructure. The question then is no longer whether we can afford to pay top talent. It is whether we can afford not to. The author is a corporate advisor and author of ‘Family and Dhanda’ Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Title: Valuation Check: Is Nvidia still a buy after the surge?

Nvidia’s stock closed at $164.10 on Thursday, gaining 0.75% during the day. This pushed the chipmaker’s total market value to $4.004 trillion, marking the first time it ended a trading session above this milestone. With this, Nvidia has extended its lead over tech giants Apple and Microsoft, reinforcing its dominance in the AI-driven tech rally. (Source: Reuters) Nvidia’s high-performance processors are central to the AI infrastructure being built by major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. These firms are investing heavily in artificial intelligence data centres, and Nvidia's chips are powering much of that transformation, making the company a key enabler in the ongoing AI revolution. After reaching a $1 trillion market capitalisation in June 2023, Nvidia has tripled its value in just about a year—a feat unmatched by even the largest tech firms. Microsoft is currently valued at $3.73 trillion, while Apple, impacted by slower AI integration, has slipped to $3.17 trillion after a 15% decline in its stock price this year. Despite its impressive growth, Nvidia faces some challenges. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China could affect its ability to export its most powerful chips. Analysts also caution that as AI adoption becomes more widespread, demand might shift to more affordable alternatives, posing a competitive threat to Nvidia’s high-margin products. Even with its meteoric rise, Nvidia’s stock is currently trading at around 33 times expected earnings. This is actually lower than its five-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 41, according to LSEG. While lofty, the valuation is not considered excessively stretched relative to its historical norm, indicating investor confidence in sustained future growth.

Title: 2025 Trump jobs report shows historic labor shift: Native-born gains hit 2 million as foreign-born employment plummets

Critics warn of labor shortages in construction and agriculture as foreign-born workers exit workforce. Critics warn of labor shortages in construction and agriculture as foreign-born workers exit workforce. The U.S. Department of Laborâs June Employment Situation Report revealed a seismic shift in the labor market under President Donald Trumpâs administration: Native-born workers have earned 2.056 million jobs since January 2025, while foreign-born employment fell by 543,000. The Household Survey data, highlighting a stark demographic divergence, has become a focal point of the Trump White Houseâs narrative of prioritizing American workers amid tightening immigration policies. In June alone, native-born Americans added 830,000 jobs, pushing their total labor-force participation to a record high of 132.65 million. By contrast, foreign-born workersâwhich include both legal and unauthorized immigrantsâreported a 348,000 drop in June and a 543,000-year-to-date decline. The turnaround contrasts sharply with 2024, when foreign-born employment rose 1.025 million under the Biden administration, nearly matching native-born gains of 1.099 million. âThis economy is booming again,â declared White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on July 9. âAmerican-born workers have accounted for ALL of the job gains since President Trump took office, and wage growth continues climbing. These numbers prove our policies are working.â The report solidified a trend Trumpâs team has emphasized since reclaiming the White House: dismantling policies perceived as disadvantaging U.S. workers. White House communications have repeatedly framed the data as proof of fulfilling promises to prioritize native-born labor force participation, long a cornerstone of Trumpâs political identity. Policy-driven transformation: Immigration crackdown sparks economic shift The administration attributes the reversal to aggressive implementation of its âAmerica Firstâ agenda. The Trump era has seen dramatically increased workplace immigration enforcement, including raids targeting employers of unauthorized workers and stricter eligibility checks. White House officials argue this has incentivized businesses to hire native-born Americans, who now dominate job growth. The report coincided with record-monthly deportations: 188,000 unauthorized immigrants removed in June, a 55% increase over Januaryâs totals. Employers across industries face heightened penalties for non-compliance, with companies like Amazon and Tyson Foods recently restricting hiring of non-citizen applicants. However, critics contend the crackdown exacerbates labor shortages in sectors reliant on foreign-born workers, including agriculture and construction. A Bloomberg analysis warns 5% of the workforceâover 5 million workersâcould exit labor markets in key industries, putting pressure on food production and infrastructure projects. âThe administrationâs singular focus on restricting immigration is creating new risks to economic stability, particularly in sectors that canât function without immigrant labor,â said labor economist Dr. Maria Espinosa. âThis isnât just a demographic shiftâitâs a redefinition of who participates in the U.S. economy.â Balancing gains and challenges: Sector shifts and economic uncertainties While White House rhetoric centers on the 2.056 million native-born job gains, the report also highlights uneven sector growth and lingering weaknesses. Total nonfarm payrolls rose 147,000 in June, led by the nearly 200,000-worker surge in healthcare and educational servicesâa trend attributed to federal spending mandates for clinics and public schools. Yet the expansion was uneven. Private sectors outside healthcare faltered, with manufacturing and technology firms announcing 18,000 layoffs in June. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped to 3.9%, near historic lows, but broader Labor Department metrics show rising hardship for foreign-born workers: about 820,000 filed for unemployment claims since January, many citing workplace crackdowns as cause. Soutbay Research analysts warned of fragility: âJuneâs strong headline numbers depend largely on volatile sectors,â including government jobs and public education. âA harsh winter season or federal funding lull could unravel progress.â Public sector dominance has also drawn scrutiny, with critics questioning the sustainability of government-linked employment in a 13th consecutive month of economic expansion. The road ahead: Legislative hopes and theÂ âOne Big Beautiful Bill Actâ early test The Biden-era Paycheck Protection Programâs expiration and a contentious debate over the âOne Big Beautiful Bill Actâ loom large over Trumpâs economic agenda. The proposed law would formalize policies to restrict foreign labor and expand vocational training for Americans, a pillar of the administrationâs jobs strategy. âOnce Congress passes the One Big Beautiful Bill, these numbers will explode,â Leavitt declared, predicting a 30% acceleration in job creation by 2026. The act faces fierce opposition, notably from Republican moderates wary of labor shortages stifling economic growth. As the 2026 elections approach, the reportâs triumphs and tensions reflect deeper ideological divisions. For the Trump team, the 200,000-plus monthly native-born gains since January 2025 vindicate the central campaign pledges of an economy âbuilt for Americans first.â Yet as sectors like agriculture reel, the debate over whether that approach serves all Americans continues apace. A prosperous future Juneâs jobs data highlights a historic shift toward prioritizing American workers, directly reflecting policies championed by the Trump administration to reclaim control over our workforce. These measures, which prioritize domestic labor over outsourcing and restrictive trade deals, signal a vital step toward reversing decades of wage stagnation and job displacement caused by flawed immigration practices and globalist agreements. As Congress advances the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the labor marketâs evolution underscores the imperative to prioritize U.S. sovereignty and fairness for working families. By curbing reliance on foreign worker visas, securing borders and renegotiating trade terms that favor American industries, policymakers have laid the groundwork for a economy that rewards hardworking Americansâensuring long-term prosperity rests on a foundation of domestic strength, equitable wages and a clear focus on who matters most: the people of this nation.

A prosperous future Juneâs jobs data highlights a historic shift toward prioritizing American workers, directly reflecting policies championed by the Trump administration to reclaim control over our workforce.

As Congress advances the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the labor marketâs evolution underscores the imperative to prioritize U.S. sovereignty and fairness for working families. By curbing reliance on foreign worker visas, securing borders and renegotiating trade terms that favor American industries, policymakers have laid the groundwork for a economy that rewards hardworking Americansâensuring long-term prosperity rests on a foundation of domestic strength, equitable wages and a clear focus on who matters most: the people of this nation. Sources for this article include: YourNews.com FoxBusiness.com FastBull.com In June alone, native-born Americans added 830,000 jobs, pushing their total labor-force participation to a record high of 132.65 million. By contrast, foreign-born workersâwhich include both legal and unauthorized immigrantsâreported a 348,000 drop in June and a 543,000-year-to-date decline. The turnaround contrasts sharply with 2024, when foreign-born employment rose 1.025 million under the Biden administration, nearly matching native-born gains of 1.099 million. âThis economy is booming again,â declared White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on July 9. âAmerican-born workers have accounted for ALL of the job gains since President Trump took office, and wage growth continues climbing. These numbers prove our policies are working.â The report solidified a trend Trumpâs team has emphasized since reclaiming the White House: dismantling policies perceived as disadvantaging U.S. workers. White House communications have repeatedly framed the data as proof of fulfilling promises to prioritize native-born labor force participation, long a cornerstone of Trumpâs political identity. Policy-driven transformation: Immigration crackdown sparks economic shift The administration attributes the reversal to aggressive implementation of its âAmerica Firstâ agenda. The Trump era has seen dramatically increased workplace immigration enforcement, including raids targeting employers of unauthorized workers and stricter eligibility checks. White House officials argue this has incentivized businesses to hire native-born Americans, who now dominate job growth. The report coincided with record-monthly deportations: 188,000 unauthorized immigrants removed in June, a 55% increase over Januaryâs totals. Employers across industries face heightened penalties for non-compliance, with companies like Amazon and Tyson Foods recently restricting hiring of non-citizen applicants. However, critics contend the crackdown exacerbates labor shortages in sectors reliant on foreign-born workers, including agriculture and construction. A Bloomberg analysis warns 5% of the workforceâover 5 million workersâcould exit labor markets in key industries, putting pressure on food production and infrastructure projects. âThe administrationâs singular focus on restricting immigration is creating new risks to economic stability, particularly in sectors that canât function without immigrant labor,â said labor economist Dr. Maria Espinosa. âThis isnât just a demographic shiftâitâs a redefinition of who participates in the U.S. economy.â Balancing gains and challenges: Sector shifts and economic uncertainties While White House rhetoric centers on the 2.056 million native-born job gains, the report also highlights uneven sector growth and lingering weaknesses. Total nonfarm payrolls rose 147,000 in June, led by the nearly 200,000-worker surge in healthcare and educational servicesâa trend attributed to federal spending mandates for clinics and public schools. Yet the expansion was uneven. Private sectors outside healthcare faltered, with manufacturing and technology firms announcing 18,000 layoffs in June. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped to 3.9%, near historic lows, but broader Labor Department metrics show rising hardship for foreign-born workers: about 820,000 filed for unemployment claims since January, many citing workplace crackdowns as cause.
