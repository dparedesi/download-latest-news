Businesses planning to move staff on to their existing pension schemes to avoid being captured by the incoming automatic enrolment system are being urged to take action well before the new State-run portal goes live in December. Department of Finance officials have confirmed that auto-enrolment (AE) instructions will be issued in early December, targeting an estimated 800,000 workers in the Republic that are not currently part of a workplace or private pension plan. However, any cases where pension contributions have been made through payroll in the 13 weeks prior to that date will be exempt from the AE regime, which is called My Future Fund, they said. Many companies are known to be planning to move AE-eligible workers into their own existing defined contribution pension plans. “Companies intending to use their existing plan to achieve AE compliance, as many of them are, should get their ducks in a row well before the official January implementation date if they want to get their staff safely embedded with their own plans,” said Shane O’Farrell, director of workplace markets at Irish Life’s employer solutions unit. “Employers should aim to have the first pension contributions for newly enrolled staff by mid-November. This will avoid the risk that employees are enrolled into the State AE model by default, because they lack a history of pension contributions in their current employment.” There has been some concern among businesses that there would be little time to enter and cross-check details of workers being included in the AE scheme, as the online portal is only set to go live in December, according to sources. However, a spokeswoman for the department said that employers “will have a number of weeks” to use the AE portal and put in information, including preferred payment methods, before the official go-live date. “Employers will have a number of weeks to do this before go-live, giving ample time for them to ensure that they are able to meet their legal requirements and avoid the risk of fines, penalties and potential prosecution,” she said. [ How can I find what my likely State pension will be?Opens in new window ] Meanwhile, the department is planning to issue invitations to employers and representative groups “in the coming days” to an information event on the AE regime. “The event will be livestreamed and recorded to maximise outreach and will be supplemented by department-led webinars,” the spokeswoman said. The Irish Times first reported on Wednesday that former National Lottery chief executive Dermot Griffin has been selected to head up the agency that will oversee My Future Fund, the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority (Naersa) – marking a major milestone in the project. It will be chaired by Roma Burke, an experienced actuary with extensive knowledge of the pensions industry. The introduction of the AE system has been the subject of a number of delays in recent years. The system is now set to start on January 1st. AE will apply to workers aged between 23 and 60 who earn at least €20,000 a year across one or more jobs and who are not already members of an occupational pension scheme. Employers and employees will each initially contribute 1.5 per cent of gross earnings to their pension pot, with the Government adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions are due to increase in stages, reaching 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in year 10. Under the auto-enrolment scheme, funds will be managed by three investment providers – Irish Life Investment Managers, Amundi and Blackrock. Indian information technology company Tata Consultancy Services was hired in 2024 to build and run the system. My Future Fund is expected to hold more than €20 billion of assets on behalf of beneficiaries within 10 years, rising potentially to more than €300 billion over 30-40 years, according to the Government.

Title: 5 biggest takeaways from the Nvidia Q2 earnings call

Time Published: 2025-08-28T02:43:49Z

Nvidia exceeded expectations once again in its second quarter of 2025, but China remains a question mark. On Wednesday, the chipmaking giant reported $46.74 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, both beating analyst estimates. The company also forecast third-quarter sales of about $54 billion. Despite the upbeat earnings, Nvidia shares slipped in extended trading as data center revenue fell short of forecasts for a second straight quarter, and as signs of slowing growth began to show. From the uncertainties around the H20 chips' shipment to China to the spending on AI infrastructure, here are the main takeaways from the chipmaking giant's earnings call. Colette Kress, the chief financial officer, said Nvidia has yet to ship any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers recently receiving licenses. On the earnings call, she said that shipments worth $2 billion to $5 billion could flow if restrictions ease, but the company has excluded that revenue from its third-quarter forecast. The company has also floated a 15% remittance to the US government on licensed sales, though no rule has been finalized. "We just have to keep advocating," CEO Jensen Huang said during the call. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," Huang added. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. Nvidia projected its Q3 revenue at $54 billion with a 2% margin, exceeding analysts' expectations of $53.4 billion. However, the company said its projections didn't include H20 sales to China, which are still uncertain. It also approved an additional $60 billion in stock buybacks. Brian Mulberry, a senior portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told BI that he sees some parallels between Nvidia's current shares and times when Tesla would have strong financials but slowing guidance, which slows the growth in share prices. "Now NVDA is 'only' growing at 50-55% and that is much less than the 100%+ revenue growth from last year," said Mulberry. "As that momentum slows, so does the energy in the stock." Nvidia expects $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030, said Kress. The CFO called it a "significant long-term growth opportunity." Her comments come as Big Tech ramps up spending in AI and fuels GDP growth, though some tech leaders, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have warned that some investors may be overhyping the sector. Earlier this week, JPMorgan wrote in a note that the high capex spending points to strong growth forecasts in AI. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending," the bank wrote. "This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries." The build-out of AI models has powered Nvidia's growth in the last several years. Now comes robotics. "Robotic applications require exponentially more compute on the device and in infrastructure, representing a significant long-term demand driver for our data center platform," Kress said during the call. Robotics remains a small part of Nvidia's business, but Huang and Kress said they're seeing signs of growth. Jetson AGX Thor, Nvidia's latest robotics computing platform or "robot brain," was released earlier this week. Kress said the adoption of Thor "is growing at rapid rate," with more than 2 million developers taking the platform to market. The CFO also said automotive revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $586 million, primarily thanks to self-driving cars. Kress said Nvidia's successor to its popular Blackwell chip architecture, Rubin, is on track for volume production in 2026, giving investors the innovation, predictable product cycle, and revenue generator they like to see. While the earnings call didn't provide many details around the next-generation chip, Kress said the chips are "in fab," meaning that the manufacturing process has begun. "This keeps us on track with our pace of an annual product cadence and continuous innovation across compute, networking, systems, and software," Kress said. Jump to

Title: Chip giant Nvidia’s sales rise 56% in boost for AI boom

US chipmaker reports revenue of $46.74bn for second quarter, defying fears that AI may be overhyped. By John Power Chip giant Nvidia has set a new sales record, a sign that demand for artificial intelligence remains strong despite fearsthe technology may be overhyped. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, on Wednesday reported revenue of $46.74bn for the three months that ended in July, a rise of 56 percent year-on-year. Profit for the quarter was $26.42bn, a yearly rise of 59 percent. Nvidia’s latest earnings report had been hotly anticipated as the tech giant is widely seen as a barometer of the AI boom, which has lifted the US stock market from all-time high to all-time high. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that production of Blackwell Ultra, Nvidia’s latest platform using its most advanced chips, was ramping up “at full speed” and demand for the company’s products was “extraordinary”. “The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its centre,” Jensen said. Looking ahead, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant predicted revenue of $54bn, plus or minus 2 percent, for the July-September quarter, which would be slightly above market expectations. Despite the robust results, Nvidia’s stock price fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading, an indication of the sky-high expectations attached to the chipmaker, which is valued at more than $4.4 trillion. Nvidia’s sales notably did not include any shipments to China, whose market is subject to US government export controls intended to blunt Beijing’s ability to develop AI. US President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this month lifted a ban on sales of Nvidia’s H20 chip, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market, following concerted lobbying by Huang. As part of its agreement with the Trump administration, Nvidia agreed to pay the US government 15 percent of revenues from chip sales in China. The lifting of the ban on the H20 raises the possibility that Nvidia could have potentially enormous untapped sales potential in the world’s second-largest economy, though its prospects have been complicated by a recent directive by Beijing urging local firms against doing business with the company. “Just imagine what will happen to this stock if the China business even comes half back to life,” The Kobeissi Letter, a newsletter following capital markets, said. “Jensen Huang will undoubtedly be working overtime on the China situation. The AI Revolution is in full swing.” Fuelled by explosive demand for its AI, Nvidia’s revenue has grown at breakneck speed over the past two years. The company posted triple-digit revenue growth for five straight quarters between mid-2023 and 2024. Since the start of 2023, the price of Nvidia shares has multiplied more than 11 times over, with the stock up more than 30 percent so far this year. The firm’s stellar performance, underpinned by multibillion-dollar AI investments by tech giants including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, has stoked discussion about whether AI could be in a bubble. In an interview with The Verge earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who oversaw the release of the groundbreaking AI model ChatGPT, said he believed that investors were “overexcited” about the technology.

The S&P 500 achieved a record high close ahead of Nvidia's quarterly results, a key event testing the AI rally's valuation. While Nvidia's stock dipped slightly, its significant S&P 500 weighting makes its financial performance crucial.

Title: "This decision was not made lightly" — Tomb Raider dev Crystal Dynamics hit by "necessary" layoffs for second time this year, and I'm sick of writing this headline

Crystal Dynamics is going through another layoff wave after already facing cuts earlier in 2025. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Waves of layoffs in the gaming industry continue to hit developers and publishers around the world, with Crystal Dynamics — the studio best known for its work as the steward of the legendary action-adventure franchise Tomb Raider — being the latest team to be affected. The developer announced the news on Wednesday afternoon on LinkedIn, confirming that "a number of our talented colleagues" were let go from the company in response to "evolving business conditions." "Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," reads the studio's post. "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." Notably, Crystal Dynamics has vowed to do everything it can to help affected employees in the wake of these layoffs, though it hasn't publicly mentioned any specific types of aid or compensation. "To those impacted — we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition," it said. The studio concluded its statement with appreciation for the support offered by its teams, business partners, and players, also noting that the Tomb Raider franchise is supposedly "unaffected" by the cuts. "To our teams, players, and partners, thank you for your continued support as we build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together. This includes the future of Tomb Raider, which remains unaffected by this decision," reads the end of the notice. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. At present, it's unclear how many Crystal Dynamics workers have been affected by this latest wave of layoffs, or which specific divisions of the studio, if any, have been affected more than others. It's the second round of layoffs that the developer has gone through this year, with 17 workers also cut from the company in late March. Then, like now, it commented that the discharges were "necessary," and came due to a need to "better align our current business needs and the studio's future success." It's important to highlight that Crystal Dynamics is owned by Embracer Group, a massive Swedish video game holding firm infamous for the large number of layoffs and studio closures that have occurred under its wing. Much of the company's troubles in recent years have been attributed to the collapse of a critical $2 billion deal in 2022 that the firm was banking on, leading to share prices dropping by 40% in the aftermath. The developer is currently working on an untitled Tomb Raider game published by Amazon Games. It was also collaborating with Xbox studio The Initiative on the Perfect Dark reboot, though the partnership ended when Microsoft shuttered The Initiative and the Perfect Dark project in July. These new cuts at Crystal Dynamics are yet another instance of the layoffs that have swept through the gaming industry throughout the last several years, with roughly 40,000 developers in total affected. From Microsoft and Xbox, to Metal Gear Solid Delta's Virtuos Games, to Little Nightmares' Supermassive Games, to Destiny 2's Bungie, to Marvel Rivals' NetEase Games, these cuts have absolutely ravaged the industry, leaving thousands of hard-working developers out of work. The layoffs themselves have been largely attributed to overinvestment in gaming during the pandemic, with inflated interest in the industry lowering once stay-at-home mandates were lifted and daily life returned to normalcy. Wider global economic shifts are also a factor, as are rising game development costs. Though there's hope for a recovery in the near future, it's always harrowing to be met with the news of layoffs like these again and again, and frustrating to have to write this type of headline again and again, as well. For the sake of the people behind the creation of the games we love, I can only sincerely hope that the industry levels out as soon as it can. My heart, and the heart of everyone here at Windows Central, goes out to any and all developers affected by these layoffs and any others.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum (ETH) staking levels continue to break records, with the latest snapshot of the blockchain showing nearly 36.1 million ETH staked on the network – the highest level in history. According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor XWIN Research Japan, close to one-third of Ethereum’s circulating supply is now staked. This high proportion suggests that ETH may be on the verge of a structural supply shock. The following chart shared by the analyst shows that even during sharp corrections in 2022 and 2023, staking levels continued to climb. Unlike speculative flows, which often exit the market during downturns, staking activity has proven “sticky” – with investors choosing to lock ETH into the network rather than liquidate. Staking ETH carries several key implications. First, it compresses supply – as more ETH is staked, less liquid supply remains on exchanges, creating a natural “supply shock” that amplifies demand-driven price moves. Similarly, it shows the priorities of investors. By staking ETH, investors essentially work as long-term participants. In this way, they align their incentives with network security and yield instead of short-term trading. ETH’s recent rally to $4,500 also coincided with record staking levels, creating a feedback loop – higher prices attracted institutional inflows from custodians, exchange-traded funds (ETG), and whales, while reduced liquid supply added further upward pressure. ETH ETFs now hold more than $300 billion in reserves, while asset managers such as BlackRock are actively accumulating. This underscores Ethereum’s transition from a speculative asset to a yield-bearing, institutionally supported infrastructure layer. U.S.-based spot ETH ETFs also enjoyed a long streak of positive inflows, lasting from the week ending May 16 through the week ending August 15. Commenting on this shift, XWIN Research Japan noted: Ethereum’s all-time-high staking levels reveal its underlying strength: while Bitcoin faces selling dominance in taker metrics, ETH is experiencing structural supply reduction. This divergence highlights Ethereum’s growing role not just as a crypto asset, but as the backbone of tokenization, DeFi, and RWA adoption. Similar sentiments were recently echoed by Tom Lee, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors. Lee noted that ETH is getting closer to becoming the backbone of global markets. That said, some risks remain. For instance, ETH price is still lagging despite ATH in daily network transactions. At the time, the analyst said that ETH was likely still in the accumulation phase. Similarly, the recent price pullback in ETH after creating a new ATH over $4,900 shows how recurring liquidation cycles are shaping ETH’s price action every week. At press time, ETH trades at $4,606, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

Title: As Perfect Dark gets canceled and the next Tomb Raider's development stumbles on, Crystal Dynamics lays off even more developers while blaming "evolving business conditions"

This is the third round of layoffs in two years When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Crystal Dynamics has announced yet another round of layoffs, its third since the studio was acquired by Embracer Group in 2022. The news comes in the wake of the cancellation of Perfect Dark, which Crystal Dynamics was developing alongside Xbox studio The Initiative. "Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions," the studio says in a LinkedIn post (via GamesIndustry.biz). "This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." The post concludes by noting that development of the next Tomb Raider "remains unaffected by this decision." Very little about the game has been revealed since it was announced in 2022, other than the fact that it's in development on Unreal Engine 5 and will be published by Amazon Games. Crystal Dynamics did not disclose how many people were affected by today's layoffs. The company laid off 17 employees earlier this year, citing the need to "better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success." A further 10 people were laid off in 2023, that time to "align the studio with our current business needs." I guess the layoff form letters don't change much over the years. The last new game from Crystal Dynamics launched in 2020, while the studio was still a subsidiary of Square Enix. That game was Marvel's Avengers, a live-service mishap that launched to mediocre reviews and eventually shut down in 2023. The studio has contributed to some remaster projects, including Tomb Raider and Legacy of Kain, in recent years, but we're all still waiting to see what its next big game is. Crystal Dynamics is responsible for reviving the series and bringing us some of the best Tomb Raider games of all time.

Title: Instant View: Nvidia Q3 revenue forecasts suggest AI trade has more to run

(Reuters) - AI chipmaker Nvidia, the dominating force behind the U.S. stock market rally since 2023, forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday. Helped by robust demand for its artificial intelligence chips from cloud providers expanding infrastructure to power generative AI technology, Nvidia expects revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the third quarter. That compared with analysts' average estimate of $53.14 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Shares of the world's most valuable firm were down 2.4% in extended trading, paring a knee-jerk loss after the report. NVDA gained more than a third so far in 2025 to outpace the benchmark S&P 500 Index's year-to-date rise of nearly 10%. COMMENTS: THOMAS MARTIN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GLOBALT INVESTMENTS, ATLANTA GEORGIA "The overall AI trade is still very much intact. Nvidia said demand is just really, really high. So to the extent that you believe that, the AI trade is still at the very early stages." "There's nothing really to suggest that the AI trade is over. When you have something that is new, and it's growing as fast as it is, and all of the huge capex announcements from the hyperscalers, it's evidence that we're in the early stages. there's no reason that I can see that you want to sell this off to any great degree." WILL RHIND, FOUNDER AND CEO, GRANITESHARES "The market has gotten so used to NVIDIA delivering blowout earnings and data center growth that anything short of that feels like a disappointment. The modest miss on data center revenue is more a reminder that those huge growth rates are going to slow eventually." BRIAN MULBERRY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, ZACKS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT "It is double beat on top and bottom line including the $8 billion China cost. After hours even with this strong outperformance the stock is down more than 3% - a signal that the rate of growth is slowing and that causes price momentum to slow in the shares. "We saw this with Tesla at times when they would have strong financials but guidance was slowing as capacity was meeting demand which ultimately slows the rate of growth. Now NVDA is “only” growing at 50-55% and that is much less than the 100% revenue growth from last year. As that momentum slows, so does the energy in the stock. "Manufacturing operations seem to be growing at a pace that forward guidance should be easily intact going forward. It looks like they stated the China impact (opportunity costs) of $8 billion which is right on target with Jensen’s previous public statements and in line with Wall Street expectations." DAVID WAGNER, HEAD OF EQUITY, APTUS CAPITAL ADVISORS "The negative stock reaction feels like a bit of an incorrect knee-jerk reaction - the company is still growing over 50% on their guidance at a $50B quarterly revenue run rate - that's remarkable, even for the current valuation. I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue. I want to be buying the pullback as I am sure management will weave a bullish demand story on the conference call." NICK FRASSE, PRODUCT MANAGER, VANECK ASSOCIATES, NEW YORK “My takeaway is that these numbers are not unexpected, nor is this reaction. The market has begun to factor in that Nvidia can continue to beat most expectations in spite of headwinds and questions like what they will have to pay to continue selling to China. Their earnings beats and growth in EPS have become more normalized as investors understand their business model better. In the early stages of all this excitement, they had crazy beats that seemed to come out of nowhere; no one then had expected a gaming company to have this amazing AI pivot. Now we look at their business model and see that they don’t have the capital spending drag that vertically integrated companies do, but they’re benefiting from all the money that the hyperscalers clearly continue to keep spending on AI. "We launched the VanEck Fabless Semiconductor ETF exactly a year ago today, and Nvidia is its largest holding at 20.67% of the fund right now. These results give us confidence that the hyperscalers are not slowing down, and that it’s getting to the point now where as the Magnificent 7 companies continue to grow, it’s all compounding in their favor. This technology is allowing them to drive revenue higher – and then to spend more of that revenue on more technology.” MATT ORTON, HEAD OF ADVISORY SOLUTIONS, RAYMOND JAMES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, TAMPA BAY AREA "I think it should be a positive read-through eventually, after the dust settles, to the rest of the AI trade, and the fact that there's still a tremendous amount of growth that's happening." "For Nvidia, it's more of just calibration of expectations, but the fact that you saw such strong growth, particularly across the data centers, and just the absolute numbers that are associated with the revenues that are coming in, I think all of that is a sign that there is still a lot of room to run with respect to the AI capex story." "The mega caps are the ones propelling a lot of the capex that Nvidia is benefiting from. But obviously Nvidia still is growing, is able to sell. If anything, this just highlights that there's a lot of durability to this (AI) trade, and that, I think that the businesses of these hyperscalers can continue to accelerate, and you're not seeing any sort of signs of a slowdown being reflected in the results of Nvidia." "The results from Nvidia will just reaffirm the fact that we're not in an AI bubble." DIMITRI ZABELIN, SENIOR ANALYST, AI, PITCHBOOK, SAN FRANCISCO, CA "Since the onset of the AI boom in late 2022, the company has largely beaten forecasts, propelled by explosive growth in its data center division. "As U.S. hyperscaler demand continues to expand, Nvidia is diversifying by turning to sovereign buyers to anchor the next wave of adoption, positioning national governments as strategic clients for its hardware. "PitchBook’s comp sheet analysis also shows hyperscalers and AI infrastructure leaders outperforming benchmarks, underscoring durable demand for compute hardware as governments and enterprises step up procurement." LARRY TENTARELLI, CHIEF TECHNICAL STRATEGIST, BLUE CHIP DAILY TREND REPORT "In the very short-term, the stock is seeing some downside testing, as they did not drastically exceed the consensus forecasts. Beyond the short-term volatility, Nvidia remains the benchmark Artificial Intelligence stock and the most direct way to invest in the theme. "The AI trade has been the major driver of this bull market over the past 30 months and we expect that both AI and Nvidia will continue to lead. "CEO Jensen Huang’s comments on the conference call will be closely monitored by markets, but barring any slowdown comments from Huang, we would be buyers of Nvidia on any near-term weakness. In our view, this is the dominant AI market leader to own." CHUCK CARLSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, HORIZON INVESTMENT SERVICES, HAMMOND, INDIANA The results "were okay. They weren't blow-the-doors-off, but nor were they bad. And I think the stock price movement is going to depend a lot on what they say on the earnings call, especially if they give color on China." "I think people were a little disappointed in the data center number, which looks like the sequential growth was about 5% ... and I think people might have been looking for a little bit more on that side." "I'm not surprised that the stock in the after-market is down a bit, but it is not down a ton, especially given the strength that the stock is showing so far this year."

Nvidia (NVDA) reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter on Wednesday, posting revenue of $46.7 billion, a 56% increase from a year earlier. The results underscore the chipmaker’s role at the center of the AI boom, as demand for its high-powered processors showed little sign of slowing. Shares of the company fell 1.7% in after-hours trading, with some noting data center revenue as a bit soft at $41.1 billion against estimates of $41.29 billion. AI-linked tokens such as Internet Computer ICP$5.0555, NEAR Protocol, and Bittensor TAO$332.32 showed little reaction to the news, trading roughly flat from prior to the results. Bitcoin BTC$111,481.44, ether (ETH) and XRP XRP$2.9144 knee-jerked lower on the news, but quickly retraced those losses, showing roughly no net movement from prior to the earnings. Wall Street will parse Nvidia’s commentary closely, especially for signs that hyperscalers like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon are still ramping up chip orders. Analysts are also looking for updates on the company’s work to develop more advanced chips for China, a market where U.S. export restrictions complicate sales. Nvidia is set to host its earnings call at 5 p.m. E.T., where executives will field questions from analysts.

Title: Nvidia Earnings Beats Wall Street Expectations And Sets Another Quarterly Sales Record
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/08/27/nvidia-earnings-beats-wall-street-expectations-and-sets-another-quarterly-sales-record/

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. The world’s most valuable company reported second-quarter earnings Wednesday that beat Wall Street’s expectations yet again, with investors seeking clues into how Nvidia fared with challenges in the China market. Nvidia reported $46.7 billion in second-quarter revenue, surpassing the chip designer’s sales record of $44.1 billion in the previous quarter and besting economist forecasts of $46.05 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. A bulk of Nvidia’s top-line came from nearly $41.1 billion in data center revenue, which Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote Monday would drive Nvidia’s business over the next year, behind predictions of $41.3 billion. The AI firm brought in adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 and $25.78 billion net income, besting Wall Street’s projections of $1.01 EPS and $24.7 billion, respectively. Nvidia’s top- and bottom-line figures account for annual increases of 6% and 42%, respectively trumping the year-earlier totals of $30 billion and $0.67 EPS. Nvidia shares briefly fell 4% in after-hours trading following the release of the company’s earnings report. The stock hit an intraday high of $184.12 earlier this month, while Nvidia shares traded around $181 before market close Wednesday. Nvidia will host a call with investors at 5 p.m. EDT. Some analysts are looking for answers from CEO Jensen Huang about the Chinese government pressuring domestic companies not to buy the company’s H20 AI processors over national security concerns, leading Nvidia reportedly to halt production. Morgan Stanley believes this “remains an important issue to resolve long term,” though it would likely be resolved “with both countries incentivized to enable access to U.S. hardware,” Moore wrote. Kevin Cassidy, an analyst for Rosenblatt Securities, wrote his firm believes Nvidia will introduce a “China-specific” alternative to the AI chip, which could “command a higher price point, better margins and offer a more competitive solution.” WedBush Securities, in a note Wednesday led by Seth Basham, said Nvidia is one of 30 companies that will “define the future of the AI revolution over the coming years.” The brokerage dispelled fears Nvidia and other AI firms would be the victims of a broader “stock market bubble,” adding, “The potential for AI to drive productivity and economic growth dwarfs past technologies.” As the last of the “Magnificent Seven” companies to report Q2 earnings this year, Nvidia closes out a three-month period of growing competition, specifically in China. Chinese semiconductor firm Cambricon reported a record $402 million profit over the first half of 2025, though Wall Street remains optimistic for Nvidia’s growth prospects while backed by demand for AI technology and data centers. Analysts for Evercore ISI wrote earlier this month they believed rising cloud demand at companies like Amazon indicates AI has “hit a tipping point at enterprises,” as Nvidia’s chips are the “solution of choice” for training AI language models. The brokerage noted Nvidia remains its “top pick” in the near term and lifted its price target for Nvidia’s stock to $214 from $190.

August 27, 2025 16:20 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially. There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 72.4% and 72.7%, respectively. Excluding the $180 million release, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter would have been 72.3%. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.08 and $1.05, respectively. Excluding the $180 million release and related tax impact, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter would have been $1.04. “Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for, delivering an exceptional generational leap — production of Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA NVLink rack-scale computing is revolutionary, arriving just in time as reasoning AI models drive orders-of-magnitude increases in training and inference performance. The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center.” During the first half of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA returned $24.3 billion to shareholders in the form of shares repurchased and cash dividends. As of the end of the second quarter, the company had $14.7 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. On August 26, 2025, the Board of Directors approved an additional $60.0 billion to the Company’s share repurchase authorization, without expiration. NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on October 2, 2025, to all shareholders of record on September 11, 2025. Q2 Fiscal 2026 Summary OutlookNVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: HighlightsNVIDIA achieved progress since its first quarter earnings announcement in these areas: Data Center Gaming and AI PC Professional Visualization Automotive and Robotics CFO CommentaryCommentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com. Conference Call and Webcast InformationNVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2026 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2026. Non-GAAP MeasuresTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, H20 related charges/releases, net and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. The inclusion of H20 related charges/releases, net in the reconciliations to adjust the related GAAP financial measures was a result of the U.S. government informing NVIDIA in April 2025 that it requires a license for export to China of H20 product. The H20 product was designed primarily for the China market. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Title: When does Nvidia report earnings? Time, how to tune in

Time Published: 2025-08-27T20:03:06Z

Nvidia (NVDA) reported better than expected results in its second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Aug. 27, roughly two weeks after the company agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of the sale of its H20 chips to China. The company reported $46.7 billion dollars in total revenue, a 56% rise year-over-year, with a corresponding rise in data center revenue. Still, analysts were expecting $41.3 billion in data center revenue and the company reported $41.1. Nvidia’s stock traded down to roughly $179 per share early on Wednesday, Aug. 27 but by around 4 p.m. ET, its stock rose to about $182, according to Yahoo Finance data. Shares slipped in the after hours, trading around $176 or down around 3% as of 6:30 p.m. ET. The company previously said it expected to lose $8 billion in the second quarter after President Donald Trump banned the sale of its chips to China in April. Trump later rescinded the ban. Nvidia said in its earnings release that it sold none of it's chips made for the Chinese customers in the country but it "benefitted" from the release of $180 million in inventory to a customer outside of China. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the earnings call that the company could ship $2 billion to $5 billion in revenue from the H20 chip in the thrid quarter if "political issues" are resolved. Analysts anticipated a 6.2% move for the stock, which could bring the to an all-time high of $192.88, or send it down to $170.66, mimicking its July levels. The company reported an EPS of $1.05, beating expectations of $1.01, and revenue of $46.7 billion, beating expectations of $46.1 billion. Additionally, the company announced a $60 billion share buyback program and issued guidance of $54 billion for the next quarter. The chipmaker’s earnings and sales were expected to jump 53% from a year ago to $45.9 billion, CNBC reported. Out of the last 12 financial reports, Nvidia has topped estimates 11 times. The stock is currently up 30% year-to-date. In July, Nvidia became the first company to hit a $4 trillion market cap. Analyst Jacob Bourne of Emarketer pointed to the shortnening runway for AI and increased competetition for Nvidia stock slipping in commentarty provided to USA TODAY. "The data center results, while massive, showed hints that hyperscaler spending could tighten at the margins if near-term returns from AI applications remain difficult to quantify," Bourne wrote. Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said that the stock had been "priced at perfection" in provided commentary. "Even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation," Monteiro wrote.

Despite uncertainty about trade with China, Nvidia forecasts it will take in even more money than analysts expected in three months' time. Business and economics reporter @taaffems Thursday 28 August 2025 07:26, UK The world's most valuable company, and first to be valued at $4trn (£2.9trn), beat market expectations in keenly anticipated financial results. Microchip maker Nvidia recorded revenues of $46.7bn (£34.6bn) in just three months up to July, latest financial data from the company showed, slightly better than Wall Street observers had expected. The company's performance is seen as a bellwether for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, with investors paying close attention to see whether the hype is overblown or if significant investment will pay off. Originally a creator of gaming graphics hardware, Nvidia's chips help power AI capability - and the UK's most powerful supercomputer. Nvidia's graphics processors underpin products such as ChatGPT from OpenAI and Gemini from Google. Other tech giants - Microsoft, Meta and Amazon - make up Nvidia's biggest customers and are paying large sums to embed AI into their products. Why does it matter? Nvidia has been central to the boom in AI development and the surge in tech stock valuations, which has seen stock markets reach record highs. It represents about 8% of the value of the US S&P 500 stock market index of companies relied on to be stable and profitable. Strong results will continue to fuel record highs in the market. Conversely, results that fail to live up to the hype could trigger a market tumble.

Its value impacts anyone with cash in the US stock market, such as pension funds. The S&P 500 rose 14% over the past year, and the tech-company-heavy NASDAQ gained 21%, largely thanks to Nvidia. As such, its earnings can move markets as much as major economic or monetary policy announcements, like an interest rate decision. What next? Revenue rises are forecast to continue to rise as Nvidia said it expected a rise to roughly $54bn (£40bn) in the next three months, more than the $53.14bn (£39.3bn) anticipated by analysts. This excludes any potential shipments to China as export of Nvidia's H20 chip, designed with the Biden administration's export crackdown on advanced AI powering chips in mind, had been banned under US national security grounds. But in recent weeks, Nvidia and another chipmaker, AMD, reached an unprecedented agreement to pay the Trump administration a 15% portion of China sales in return for export licences to send chips to China. There were no H20 sales at all to China in the second quarter of the year, the period for which results were released on Wednesday evening. Previously, 13% of Nvidia's revenue came from China, with nearly 50% coming from the US. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Market reaction Despite the expectation-beating results, Nvidia shares were down by up to 3% in after-hours trading, as the massive revenue rises previously booked by the company were not repeated in the latest quarter, fuelling fears of a more persistent slowdown in growth ahead. Compared to a year ago, revenues rose 56% and 6% compared to the three months up to April. The absence of Chinese sales in forecasts appeared to disappoint. But Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "Smart investors will look through the noise. Nvidia has traded flat or down after results in four of the past five quarters, only to do all the heavy lifting after markets have had time to digest the results. "The law of large numbers seems irrelevant here - despite its scale, Nvidia continues to defy expectations as consensus underestimates the opportunity at hand. Third-quarter revenue guidance at $54bn is a strong number, especially when it factors in no benefit from Chinese sales."

Title: MicroStrategy Successfully Claims 3% Of Bitcoin Supply, Here’s How Much It’s Now Worth

Time Published: 2025-08-27T17:00:14Z

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has achieved a milestone that cements its reputation as the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin. A recent acquisition of 3,018 BTC on August 25 at a total purchase price of $357 million has pushed the company’s total Bitcoin portfolio to 632,457 BTC. Based on the current price of Bitcoin, the total value of the portfolio is valued at $46.502 billion. However, outside the value of its holdings, data shows that Strategy now controls over 3% of Bitcoin’s current circulating supply. According to Strategy’s website, the American-based technology company now holds 632,457 BTC. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has a total circulating supply of 19,912,106, although the maximum supply is hard capped at 21,000,000. In numbers alone, Strategy now owns 3.176% of the circulating supply of Bitcoin. Claiming such a large share of Bitcoin shows the scale of the company’s commitment and its strategy of positioning Bitcoin as the backbone of its corporate treasury. Owning more than 3% of Bitcoin’s supply has not only been symbolic but also financially rewarding for Strategy. In the current quarter alone, its portfolio has grown by 4.7%, generating $3.156 billion in gains. Since the start of 2025, the value of its holdings has increased by 25.4%, amounting to an increase of $12.641 billion in dollar terms. The company’s Bitcoin-based investment’s profit in 2025 has already surpassed the entire profit of $13.133 billion recorded in 2024. Notably, this Bitcoin buying strategy means the company’s performance is now linked to Bitcoin’s price movements, with every percentage increase in BTC translating into billions in added value. According to data from Bitcointreasuries.net, Strategy is by far the biggest public Bitcoin treasury company. The second is America-based digital asset technology company MARA Holdings, which currently holds 60,639 BTC. Strategy is now part of the top five Bitcoin holders, behind crypto exchange Coinbase, Satoshi Nakamoto, and Spot Bitcoin ETF issuer BlackRock, which has seen the value of its Bitcoin holdings grow to over 747,000 BTC in August 2025. Interestingly, Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio has even surpassed the total amount of BTC held in the Binance exchange reserve, which data from Coinglass currently puts at 578,903 BTC. Although holding over 3% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is a milestone few companies could have imagined, Strategy’s ambitions are far from fulfilled. Co-founder and former CEO Michael Saylor recently outlined a plan to raise $100 billion within the next four years to finance the company’s Bitcoin credit initiative. The financing could even reach up to $200 billion if the demand for the company’s securities is strong. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $111,300, up by 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

Business Nvidia logo, computer chips and a 3D-printed representation of a robot hand are seen in this illustration taken August 27, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration AI hype that has helped push U.S. stocks to fresh records this year has driven an explosion in leveraged single stock exchange-traded funds, a universe of speculative products that is likely to be tested by Nvidia's Wednesday earnings. Companies that investors expect to benefit either directly or indirectly from the AI revolution now dominate U.S. single stock leveraged and inverse ETFs, underscoring investor demand for products that magnify their AI-themed bets, according to a Reuters analysis of industry data from issuers, Morningstar and CFRA Research. So far in 2025, asset managers have launched 112 U.S.-listed leveraged and inverse ETFs tied to a single stock, compared with 38 in all of 2024, according to data from Morningstar, CFRA Research and issuers, leading some analysts to warn the market is getting overcrowded. Leveraged and inverse ETFs, which allow investors to profit when shares rise or fall, use swaps or options to produce those targeted returns and are attractive to speculators eager to play daily price moves.

Title: Cut welfare, give billions to Ukraine, suppress opposition: The German leader’s checklist to success
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/623597-merz-welfare-ukraine-opposition/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T16:43:42Z
Full Content:
By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory German chancellor Friedrich Merz has made a moderate media splash and ruffled some feathers in his own ruling coalition with the Centrist Social Democrats (SPD). Using the platform of a regional party congress of his CDU Conservatives in Niedersachsen, Merz has delivered a speech that immediately attracted national attention and will be remembered for one phrase. “The social [welfare] state, as we have it today,” the chancellor declared with appropriately dour mien, “can no longer be financed by what we are achieving economically.” Put differently, severe budget cuts on social issues are coming. And since that is a policy operative since, at the latest, 2003, there really isn’t so much left to cut. Merz is promising his people more of a bad time. His people. Not, however, the ultra-corrupt political anti-elite of Ukraine. Just before Merz’s claim that Germany cannot afford what it used to offer to Germans who pay for it, his government promised €9 billion ($10.4 bn) per year for Ukraine in 2025 and 2026, for now. That is on top of the €44 billion already sent that way. Germany is the “second-largest backer” of the Kiev regime in the world, as its obviously thoroughly detached finance minister Lars Klingbeil emphasizes with a perverse pride that must sound like a bad joke to many of his compatriots. Speaking of Klingbeil, in his Niedersachsen speech Merz also announced that he would “deliberately not make it easy” for his government colleagues from the SPD, who include, of course, Klingbeil. The SPD, of course, is well-known for being against harsh reductions in what Germans can expect from, in essence, old-age pensions, public health care, and the basic form of unemployment insurance now known as “Bürgergeld” (literally, “citizens’ money”). There is no reason to underestimate Merz’s genuine ideological commitment. It is true that, in general, he is unusually brutal about being dishonest even for a politician: Germany’s current leader has already proven that he is capable of breathtaking flipflops, staggering electoral bad faith, and underhanded maneuvering that violates the spirit of democracy if not the letter of the constitution. In the spring, his U-turn on public debt, to finance Germany’s new militarism on – exuberant – credit, was not only a massive breach of trust regarding especially his own conservative voters. Shamelessly exploiting a legal loophole, Merz also executed this radical reversal – many in his own party called it betrayal – by relying on parliamentary majorities that had already been cancelled by an election. Likewise, Merz’s coalition then proceeded to break promises regarding an energy tax relief as well as benefits for mothers. Germans are angry, but there is no sign that Merz and his government care. Consequently, according to a fresh poll by the reputable INSA institute, 62 percent of Germans are dissatisfied with their government. And yet, there is a hard core of authentic Merz, shaped by his own wealth, a very privileged life without material worries, and his long career as an overpaid member of the supervisory-board network nobility, at BlackRock and elsewhere: if there is one thing Germany’s leader is sincere about, it is his iron will to make the less well-off bleed more and work even harder, while making sure that those as materially comfortable and safe as himself get even richer. Call it neoliberalism with an unsmiling German face. Merz, of course, is also a very ordinary man, incapable of much self-reflection. He cannot honestly face any of the above. Instead he misunderstands himself as a savior of the fatherland, which he sees in need of much tough love and plenty of wholesome kicks up the backside to rediscover discipline, hard work, and competitiveness. The upshot of Merz’s blatant upper-class bias is, as a perspicacious German observer has put it, a de facto escalation of the ongoing re-distribution of income, wealth, and life chances – from those below to those above. Even now, 80 percent of the country’s taxes stem from income and value-added taxation. In other words: you work, you eat and keep a family going – be proud, you are also doing by far the most to pay the country’s bills. But Friedrich Merz, a millionaire who falls under “silver-spoon” rather than “self-made,” thinks it’s not yet enough. No wonder, then, that Merz’s recent speech in Niedersachsen has resonated. It was delivered in a sour as well as emphatic tone perhaps best described as schoolmasterly belligerence and featured much gratuitous no-compromise posing addressed probably more to his own doubting party and voters then his SPD coalition partners in Berlin. If Merz’s intention was to achieve a minor shock effect after Germany’s political summer break, he’s scored an ephemeral success. But his speech has also been misunderstood. In reality, its key message was something else and even worse. Yet another “business-friendly” – and business has also been very friendly to him – instinctive Western austeritarian telling his people they are having it too good and must lower their expectations? Not really news, is it? What was much more interesting was Merz’s reasoning. In his own words, the central political challenge is to prove that Germany “can be governed successfully from the center.” Or to be concrete, to keep down and out of power Germany’s two “populist” insurgent parties: from the right the very successful Alternative for Germany party (AfD), which tends to lead German opinion polls now, and, from the left, the currently marginalized – probably by foul play in the manner of, say, Romania or Moldova – but still threatening Bündnis Sarah Wagenknecht (BSW). Merz’s threat to go after what is left of the social welfare state in Germany comes with a promise of “reforms,” indeed a whole “autumn of reforms.” The purpose of this planned political offensive is clear: to persuade voters that they need not rely on those terrible “populists” to finally break out of the German doom loop of economic decline, demographic crisis, and pervasive malaise. Yet Merz’s strategy of what Germans call a “Befreiungsschlag” (a “deliverance strike”) smells of despair and is unlikely to succeed. Instead of an “autumn of reforms,” Germans are more likely to see their Winter of Discontent get even grimmer. Consider some basic data: We have just learned that Germany’s recession in the last quarter has been even worse than predicted: -0.3 instead of -0.1 percent. German industry is shedding jobs by the hundreds of thousands. In general, Germany’s economy remains heavily dependent on exports. It has stagnated for half a decade already and been in serious trouble much longer. In the EU+Britain, it is the most brutally affected by Trump’s ongoing and still escalating tariff war against Washington's vassals. Klingbeil admits that the budget will be €170 billion short by 2029 – despite dialing debt up to eleven. And all of that when the German ruling coalition only has what the Financial Times rightly calls a “razor-thin” parliamentary majority. Add that two of the most damaging strikes against the German economy have been self-inflicted: Sky-high energy prices, the direct result of shutting Germany off from (direct) Russian supplies – with the alleged help of a few Ukrainian divers and their US friends, of course – and subservience to the US. That subservience has only grown worse under both Merz and his equally hapless predecessor Olaf Scholz. Both have been bending over backward to please and appease America, just when its policies have become even more brutal: We are at a moment in “atlanticism” when a US treasury secretary openly announces that Washington sees its allies’ economies as its very own “sovereign wealth fund” at the disposal not of their governments or – perish the thought – citizens, but of the US president. And Merz and co. grin and nod and ask for more. The irony of it all is that while slavishly compliant with the US, Merz cannot learn the single biggest, most obvious lesson of its very recent political history, although it quite literally stares him in the face every time he visits the Oval Office to grovel: Donald Trump has become president against enormous resistance not once but twice because he led a “populist” challenge against a rotten establishment that Americans saw as unpatriotic. The future of Merz is not the success of Trump but the defeat and disgrace of Biden and everything he stood for. Germans, too, will demand a government that looks after German interests before it makes even more demands of them. Grotesquely, Merz thinks he is the savior of the old German establishment. He is its gravedigger. And in that sense, all power to his misguided arm!

Title: Brace For NVIDIA Stock To Move By 2.6x Intel’s Market Cap

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The single most important earnings announcement of the just-concluded quarter is now at hand, with NVIDIA preparing to divulge its quarterly financial performance this afternoon. And, the options market is pricing in swoon-worthy moves as a result. Depending on how you calculate it, the options market is currently expecting NVIDIA stock to move between $10.5 (based on the extrinsic values of at-the-money options) and $13.05 (based on the bid prices of at-the-money call and put options) by Friday. Since each $4 move in NVIDIA shares is roughly equal to Intel's entire market capitalization of around $100 billion, the options market is currently expecting NVIDIA stock to move between 2.6x and 3.26x Intel's market cap by this Friday! Of course, as is usually the norm, the largest percentage move in NVIDIA stock is expected to materialize in the after-hours trading session today.

This trend was clearly demonstrated during the 2Q25 earnings season, where cloud/hyperscaler… pic.twitter.com/oe6cg2vgJj As far as NVIDIA earnings specifics are concerned, Wall Street is expecting the GPU giant to post a solid beat on consensus estimates, thanks to the production ramp-up of GB200 chips and the concurrent inauguration of GB300's production process. As such, analysts expect NVIDIA to exceed its own revenue guidance of $45 billion for the just-concluded quarter, with the guidance for the October quarter likely to materialize within the $53 billion to $54 billion range, as per JPMorgan's estimates. Interestingly, NVIDIA's revenue figure of $44 billion for its April-ending quarter included around $4.5 billion worth of H20 GPU sales. Given the current reigning uncertainty around the future of that chip in China, JPMorgan believes an appropriate quarter-on-quarter baseline revenue figure for NVIDIA should preclude H20 sales, resulting in a sequential upside of between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion if NVIDIA manages to exceed its own revenue guidance for the July-ending quarter. Of course, the H20 GPU represents the biggest source of uncertainty this time around. NVIDIA's existing H20 inventory is worth around $1.9 billion and can yield ancillary revenue of between $5 billion and $6 billion if the entirety of its inventory is depleted via the sales channel. JPMorgan calculates that every 100,000 units of NVIDIA H20 GPU that is sold in China yields $1 billion in revenue.

U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs recorded $455 million in net inflows on August 26, their fourth consecutive day of gains, with BlackRock’s ETHA contributing $323 million. World’s largest asset manager BlackRock led the $450 million inflows registered across all US Ethereum ETF issuers on August 26.

Data from SoSoValue shows that both BlackRock and Fidelity led the surge, with ETHA adding $323 million and FETH bringing in $85.5 million. Grayscale’s ETHE and its Mini Ethereum Trust also reported positive inflows. Spot Ethereum ETF inflows are on the rise. | Source: SoSoValue Amid the ongoing development, BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is hitting new records with $16.5 billion in assets under management. The asset manager purchased an additional 71,037 ETH, valued at $323.08 million, with $2 billion in trading volume on August 26. This marks the fourth consecutive day of inflows for the fund, bringing its cumulative total to $984 million.

Title: Pundit Says Bitcoin Price Crash Is Not Over, Why A Decline Below $100,000 Is Coming
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-below-100000/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T15:00:02Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Mihai Jacob, a well-known market watcher, says the Bitcoin price rally that followed Powell’s Friday speech may not be as strong as it first looked. The charts, he explains, continue to flash signs of weakness that should not be ignored. According to Jacob, the flagship cryptocurrency could still face another sharp decline, and a drop below $100,000 remains a real risk despite the short-term optimism. Jacob explains that in his earlier analysis, he noted the $110,000 zone as a key level for Bitcoin. As long as that level held, the broader bullish structure could technically stay intact. Powell’s speech gave a hint of a possible rate cut, and for a moment, the market reacted with excitement, and Bitcoin bounced just as traders wanted. But Jacob quickly asks the hard question: was that bounce real strength, or just wishful thinking? He advises trading what you see, not what you hope for. And what he sees now on the charts does not match the initial joy of the rally. Soon after the move, Bitcoin returned to the $ 112,000 support level, erasing most of the gains. For Jacob, this suggests that the market may have been reacting to temporary news rather than initiating a new wave of growth. He warns that the bounce looks more like a retest of broken levels than a fresh start to a bigger move. In other words, what seemed like a comeback may actually be a signal that Bitcoin remains weak. Instead of buyers taking control, the chart suggests sellers are still in charge, waiting to push the price lower again. Looking at the bigger picture, Jacob points out that Bitcoin still trades below the trendline that has been in place since April, highlighting the shape of the price action, which suggests a possible head-and-shoulders pattern is forming around the $110,000 zone. While not perfectly shaped, it is still enough to make cautious traders uneasy about what may come next. For Jacob, the excitement that came from Powell’s speech was likely nothing more than “rate cut euphoria,” and he believes the market is sending a very different message from what headlines suggest. The idea that Bitcoin would simply return to the same support level, giving late buyers another easy opportunity, is, in his view, hard to believe. More likely, it was a “dead cat bounce,” a short-lived move before another fall. Jacob makes it clear that his current stance is neutral in terms of active positions, but his outlook leans bearish. Optimism may be tempting, but he insists that discipline requires traders to trust the charts, not their hopes. With Bitcoin still struggling under key levels, he sees the possibility of a decline below $100,000 as very real.

Title: Why Bitcoin miners say times are ‘grim’ as fee drought poses existential threat to network
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/bitcoin-mining-suffers-grim-time-as-activity-craters/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T14:41:33Z
Full Content:
About us Copy link What was once a bustling network is quickly turning into a graveyard of onchain activity. Daily transaction fees on Bitcoin have plunged more than 80% since April 2024, according to an August 20 report from Galaxy Digital. Meanwhile, Bitcoin miners, the specialised computers that dedicate themselves to securing the network, are watching their revenue plummet as transaction fees dwindle. “It is grim for miners right now and there are no real catalysts on the horizon,” Nick Hansen, CEO of mining outlet Luxor, told DL News. “In fact, I’d say there’s mostly the opposite.” The collapse comes more than a year after Bitcoin’s 2024 halving slashed block rewards in half, leaving miners increasingly dependent on transaction fees that have largely disappeared. What’s draining the world’s largest blockchain of its activity? Ironically, it’s the arrival of what enthusiasts craved for a while: institutions. BlackRock and its ilk, which have accumulated more than 1.2 million Bitcoin through their exchange-traded funds, aren’t interested in actually using the network. Instead, they just want Bitcoin, buying over-the-counter, and then safeguarding on behalf of their assets. And while the buying has been torrential, it’s not been enough to lift transaction fees for the network or revenues for its miners. Other forces are also driving down margins for miners, including US President Donald Trump’s bellicose tariff regime, although none quite as powerful as Wall Street. While the Bitcoin industry has always been bound to catatonic lows and euphoric highs, to call the state of Bitcoin mining existential isn’t a stretch. When blocks don’t reach maximum capacity and activity dries up, miners lose the transaction fees that they need to offset operational costs, such as electricity, water, and upkeep. With block rewards already halved — and programmed to continue to halve — those fees are intended to be a lifeline. So far, that’s not panning out. For Bitcoin to have sustainable long-term economics, it needs a robust fee market that will eventually replace diminishing block rewards. That premise looks increasingly shaky as "paper Bitcoin" products take over and onchain activity withers. Nearly half of all Bitcoin blocks are “not full,” wrote Galaxy Digital, which means they are not reaching their maximum capacity. Moreover, about 15% of blocks are now processing transactions that are paying the lowest possible fee rate. “This is an existential problem to Bitcoin that I don’t see an obvious solution to in the short-to-mid term,” Hansen told DL News. The network’s mempool, once a bustling and competitive place where users bid up fees to get their transactions confirmed before others, now remains idle for hours at a time with hardly any activity. “Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has entered a lull,” wrote Will Owens, the author of Galaxy Digital’s report. When activity around Runes, Bitcoin’s take on memecoins, spiked last summer, speculative tokens accounted for 60% of daily volume. According to Owens, today it hovers at around 20%. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs have swallowed 1.3 million coins worth a staggering $144 billion. For comparison, gold ETFs raked in $10 billion within three years of its launch in 2004. The problem is that every Bitcoin locked in an ETF is one less Bitcoin generating transaction fees. That’s because ETF providers package every transaction into one large tranche, settling the account at the end of the day, which results in a single transaction fee being paid. Bitcoin ETFs aren’t the only large players gobbling up coins. The top 100 Bitcoin treasuries hold nearly 1 million Bitcoin, worth about $112 billion. Like Bitcoin funds, these treasury firms are also skipping transaction fees. Still, there’s hope. Hansen sees just one potential catalyst that could revive the fee market: actively managed Bitcoin treasuries. If companies like MicroStrategy — now known as Strategy — start actively trading their massive Bitcoin holdings rather than just hoarding, it could spark renewed on-chain activity. For Hansen, Bitcoin treasury companies are moving economic activity off-chain and keeping fees suppressed. “If [treasury companies] start being more actively managed, that could be a huge fee catalyst,” Hansen said. Until then, miners face a grim reality: Bitcoin’s success as an institutional asset has made the actual blockchain increasingly irrelevant.

The largest company in the world by market cap at $4.4 trilion, Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings after the U.S. market close on Wednesday. Data from Bitcoindata21 on X shows that Nvidia earnings have historically correlated with a positive Bitcoin’s performance. Over the last 10 earnings reports since early 2023, when the current bull market began, bitcoin has posted positive price action following Nvidia results in 7 out of 10 instances. For the quarter, analysts expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 on revenue of $46.2 billion. According to The Kobeissi Letter, the options market is pricing in a 6.1% post-earnings implied move in Nvidia. That translates to a potential swing of roughly $270 billion in market capitalization. It sounds large, but this would be the smallest implied swing since May 2023. Shares of Nvidia are up 30% year to date and 41% over the past year. It's modestly lower in early Wednesday trading ahead of the quarterly results.

Title: AI Bubble 2027
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-bubble-2027/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T14:37:21Z
Full Content:
Soundtrack: The Dillinger Escape Plan - One Of Us Is The Killer An MIT study found that 95% of organizations are getting "zero return" from generative AI, seemingly every major outlet is now writing an "are we in a bubble?" story, and now Meta has frozen AI hiring. Things are looking bleak for the AI bubble, and people are getting excited that this loathsome, wasteful era might be coming to an end. As a result, I'm being asked multiple times a day when the bubble might burst. I admit I'm hesitant to make any direct timelines — we are in a time (to quote former Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan) of irrational exuberance, where the markets have oriented themselves around something very silly and very, very expensive. Regardless, Anthropic is apparently raising as much as $10 billion in its next funding round, and OpenAI allegedly hit $1 billion in revenue in July, which brings it in line with my estimate that it’s made about $5.26 billion in revenue in 2025 so far, The bubble "bursting" is not Sam Altman declaring that we're in a bubble — it's a series of events that lead to big tech pulling away from this movement, investment money drying up, and the current slate of AI companies withering and dying because they can't raise more money, can't go public, and can't sell to anybody. Anyway, earlier in the year, a bunch of credulous oafs wrote an extremely long piece of fan fiction called "AI 2027," beguiling people like Kevin Roose with its "gloominess." Written with a deep seriousness and a lot of charts, AI 2027 makes massive leaps of logic, with its fans rationalizing taking it seriously by saying that the five authors "have the right credentials." In reality, AI 2027 is written to fool people that want to be fooled and scare people that are already scared, its tone consistently authoritative as it suggests that a self-learning agent is on the verge of waking up, a thing that is so remarkably stupid that anyone who took this seriously should be pantsed again and again. These men are also cowards. They choose to use fake company names like "OpenBrain" to mask their predictions instead of standing behind them with confidence. I get that extrapolating years into the future is scary — but these grifting losers can't even commit to a prediction! Nevertheless, I wanted to take a run at something similar myself, though not in the same narrative format. In this piece, I'm going to write out what conditions I believe will burst the bubble. Some of this will be extrapolations based on my own knowledge, sources, and writing hundreds of thousands of words on this subject. I am not going to write a strict timeline, but I am going to write how some things could go, and how (and why) they'll lead to the bubble bursting. For the bubble to burst, I see a few necessary conditions, though reality is often far more boring and annoying. Regardless, it's important to know that this is a bubble driven by vibes not returns, and thus the bubble bursting will be an emotional reaction. This post is, in many respects, a follow-on to my previous “pale horse” article (called Burst Damage). Many of my original pale horses have already come true — Anthropic and OpenAI have pushed price increases and rate limits, there is already discord in AI investment, Meta is already considering downsizing its AI team, and OpenAI has done multiple different "big, stupid magic tricks," the chief of them being the embarrassing launch of GPT-5, a "smart, efficient router" that I reported last week was quite the opposite. This time, I'm going to write out the linchpin events that will shock the system, and how they might bring about the bubble bursting. I should also be clear, and I will get to after the premium break, that this will be a series of events rather than one big one, though there are big ones to look out for. I also think it might "take a minute," because "the bubble bursting" will be a succession of events that could take upwards of a year to fully happen. That’s been true for every bubble. Although people associate the implosion of the housing bubble with the “one big event” of Lehman Brothers collapsing in 2008, the reality is that it was preceded and followed by a bunch of other events, equally significant though not quite as dramatic. One VC (who you'll read about shortly) predicted it will take 6 quarters to run out of funding entirely based on the current rate of investment, putting us around February 2027 for things to have truly collapsed. Here's a list of some of the things that I believe will have to happen for this era to be truly done, and the ones that I believe are truly essential. The common thread through all of these points is that they are predominantly impossible to ignore. So far this bubble has inflated because the problems with AI — such as "it doesn't make any money" and "burns billions of dollars" — have been dismissed until very recently as the necessary costs of the beautiful AI revolution. Now that things have begun to unravel, the intensity of criticism will increase gradually, rather than in one big movement that makes everyone say "we hate AI." And it isn't just because of the money. CEOs like Tobias Lutke of Shopify have oriented their companies’ entire culture around AI, demanding in his case that "employees must demonstrate why AI cannot be used before requesting additional resources." Generative AI is, on some level, a kind of dunce detector — its flimsy and vague use cases having enough juice to impress the clueless Business Idiots who don't really engage with the production that makes their companies money. The specious, empty hype of Large Language Models — driven by a tech and business media that has given up on trying to understand them — symbolizes a kind of magic to these empty-headed goobers, and unwinding their "AI-first" cultures will be difficult...right up until the first guy does it, at which point everybody will follow. AI has taken such a hold on our markets because it's symbolic of a few things: In any case, I am going to try and write the things that I think will happen, in detail. I'll go into more conditions in this piece, and as discussed, I'm going to make some informed guesses, extrapolations, and give my thoughts about how things collapse. I predict that the impact of Large Language Models over the next decade will be enormous, not in its actual innovation or returns, but in its ability to expose how little our leaders truly know about the world or labor, how willing many people are to accept whatever the last thing a smart-adjacent person said, and how our markets and economy are driven by people with the most tenuous grasp on reality. This will be an attempt to write down what I believe could happen in the next 18 months, the conditions that might accelerate the collapse, and how the answers to some of my open questions — such as how these companies book revenue and burn compute — could influence outcomes.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The age of robots is neigh, and the market is currently sifting through the available players to sniff out those with an intrinsic advantage. Enter Serve Robotics, whose partnership with NVIDIA and Uber demands a prominent place in the last-mile urban delivery space. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Serve Robotics is currently pioneering 4-wheeled robots that leverage AI to navigate dense cityscape. These third-gen robots support advanced sensing tech and copious onboard computing resources, thanks to NVIDIA's Jetson Orin module. Of course, NVIDIA had precipitated a significant rally in Serve Robotics' stock in 2024 when it took a 10 percent stake in the company. Interestingly, NVIDIA divested the entirety of its stake in Q4 2024. Do note that Serve Robotics is currently partnered with Uber Eats to offer autonomous food deliveries in US cities such as Los Angeles. In the second quarter of 2025, the company deployed 120 delivery robots, bringing its total fleet strength to 400. Critically, Serve Robotics intends to expand its robot fleet size by 400 percent to 2,000 units by the end of 2025. Wedbush starts Serve Robotics $SERV at Outperform with a $15 PT — about 46% upside from here. Calls out strength in its autonomous delivery platform tied to AI growth. Shares sold off after $NVDA trimmed its stake, but Uber still holds ~8% and remains a key partner. It is this aggressive growth spurt that is now attracting Wall Street's attention. For instance, Wedbush has just initiated its coverage on the stock with a $15 stock price target, implying a 35 percent upside from the current price levels. Similarly, earlier in August, Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated its overweight rating on Serve Robotics shares, replete with a $17 stock price target. Serve Robotics announced $642,000 in revenue in Q2 2025, which corresponds to an annual growth rate of 46 percent. The company's strong liquidity position of $183 million (as of the end of Q2) has played an important role in aiding its hyper-aggressive expansion efforts. The company is also tapping into multiple revenue streams. For instance, it is selling advertising space on its delivery robots, allowing advertisers to gain visibility as these delivery robots become an increasingly common sight on urban walkways. Serve Robotics has a low-cost CapEx model, where it outsources the actual manufacturing of its iconic robots to Magna. Cantor Fitzgerald expects the company to price its delivery services at a more competitive sub-$8 price point, allowing a break-even period of less than 2 years for each robot.

Title: Nvidia earnings: Wall Street watching for hyperscaler spending, China demand with stock near highs
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-nvda-stock-earnings-call-report-live-updates-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-08-27T13:50:57Z
Full Content:
Nvidia's earnings report is here — but clarity on its future chip sales in China isn't. Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05. Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company. Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region. Nvidia is ready to ship between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, the CFO added. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she said. Nvidia provided a revenue range for the current quarter of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion, compared to expectations of $53.46 billion. While the revenue forecast may seem in line, some analysts had put the figure closer to $60 billion. Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he said. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong. "Everything's sold out," he said. Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. The stock's year-to-date gain was 35% at market close. Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play. In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid. "Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. "Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out." Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note. "The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another robust quarter after the bell beating the Street estimates on the top and bottom-lines again while providing stronger guidance than Street expectations," he wrote. On China, Ives wrote that Nvidia beat revenue expectations despite a $4 billion decline in China H20 sales. The company also has supplies ready to be shipped when the geopolitical situation clears up. "This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China," Ives wrote. David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the "AI platform the world's been waiting for." He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is "ramping at full speed." Eventually, he said Nvidia will need to build two factories, one for the machines and another for robotic AI. Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024. Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that "everything's sold out," including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips. He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals. Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on "annual rhythm," but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026. "Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now," Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. He says the chipmaker is talking to the administration about "the importance of American companies" getting access to China's market. Earlier in the call, Kress said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chip sales to China. Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he says. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI. "Where chatbots used to be one-shot, you give it a prompt, and it would generate the answer," Huang says. "Now, the AI does research, it thinks, it does a plan, and it might use tools." Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be "a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more." As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year. "And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously," he says. "The amount of hallucination has dropped significantly." Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks for the first time on the call. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.) Nvidia's gaming revenue reached a record $4.3 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase, Kress says. While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell. Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion. CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks. She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia is excluding China's H20 revenue from its Q3 outlook while Nvidia continues to work through geopolitical issues. A key update: If restrictions ease, the CFO estimates $2 to $5 billion in H20 sales could flow in the third quarter. Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030. "The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia," she says. CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which begins with the executives reading prepared remarks. Afterward, the executives will field questions from analysts. "Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around," wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. "Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat." "And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop," he added. In a sign of its financial strength, Nvidia says its board approved $60 billion in share repurchases on Tuesday. That's the company's largest repurchase to date, topping the $50 billion it authorized last year. It also ranks among the biggest in US history — Apple holds the record with a $110 billion announcement in 2024. Share repurchases let companies buy back their own stock, reducing the number of shares on the market. That can boost earnings per share and often lifts a company's stock price — a win for investors. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D. Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business. For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance. It did, however, still sell some H20 chips outside of the region in the current quarter. "In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted customer outside of China," the company said. "There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter." CEO Jensen Huang or CFO Colette Kress may go into greater detail on H20 on the 5 p.m. ET analyst call. Revenue: $46.74 billion, +56% y/y, estimate $46.23 billion (Bloomberg Consensus) Source: Bloomberg The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high. The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs. All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants. Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending. William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. By 2028, the firm expects that to grow to $503 billion. — Brent D. Griffiths Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China. Nvidia is working on a chip would be more powerful than the H20 to sell to China, according to a recent Reuters report. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology. — Ana Altchek Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings. Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. If the chipmaker shows signs of slowing, it could also dial up the bubble talk even further. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth. During a dinner with reporters, Altman compared the current situation to the dot-com era. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, roughly $5 trillion in market cap was wiped out. Some companies, including WorldCom and Pets.com, never returned. Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology. — Brent D. Griffiths In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports. The kingdom has poured billions into Humain, which is building some of the world's largest data centers. CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access. Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. They've already sold out of capacity, in another sign of massive global demand for AI chips. The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported. — Charles Rollet President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. The reversal reportedly came with an agreement for the US government to get a 15% cut of the revenue from H20 sales to the region. Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though. Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Despite the deal with the Trump administration to resume selling its H20 chips to China, the Chinese government gave a directive to local tech companies to stop buying the GPUs due to security concerns, the report said. Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions. — Ana Altchek Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Now, the rival chipmaker has the US government in its corner. Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips. "They are going to put us out of business," Huang said, according to the book. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel." Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline. Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call. — Brent D. Griffiths Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note. Nvidia is also readying to release its GB300 AI chip, which could launch as soon as late September. "The AI GPU competitive landscape remains very favorable to Nvidia for the second half as well as next year," the firm wrote in a note on Monday. Baird reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $225 from $195 a share, implying 25% upside. In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference. The CEO said Nvidia would be increasing its supply chain in the US and "building it here on shore." While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress. — Ana Altchek Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter. The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending. This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries," the bank said in a note to clients on Monday. Analysts reiterated their "overweight" rating on the stock. Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon reported record profit in the first half of the year, with revenue reaching $402 million. Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. — Ana Altchek Analysts at Stifel said they expected Nvidia to beat earnings estimates for the quarter and post "healthy" guidance for the third quarter, thanks to strong demand for its chips. "The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote. They continued: "As it stands today, we lean more toward the bull case, while underscoring that supply-side risk (including tariffs and trade regulations) is the key overhang to the name." Analysts reiterated their "Buy" rating on the stock and raised their price target to $212 from the prior $202, implying 18% upside. Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises." Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models. "NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. At the time analysts wrote the note, Nvidia made up around 8% of the benchmark index. Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels. Second quarter Revenue estimate: $46.23 billion Third quarter Full year 2026 Source: Bloomberg Correction, Wednesday, August 27 — An earlier version of this post incorrectly presented previous remarks from Nvidia's Q1 analyst call as being said on the Q2 call — those quotes have been removed.

Title: NZBA will vote to abandon membership model after industry exodus
URL: https://www.esgdive.com/news/nzba-will-vote-to-abandon-membership-model-after-US-canadian-European-banks-exit/758765/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T13:43:00Z

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. After waves of exits by U.S., Canadian and European banks, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance said it would vote on forgoing a membership-based model and focus on establishing industry guidance. Following President Donald Trump’s reelection in November, large U.S. banks began an exodus from the United Nations-aligned Net-Zero Banking Alliance that expanded to U.S. asset managers before rippling beyond the nation’s borders. On Wednesday, NZBA announced its steering committee will hold a vote to reframe its mission and move away from a membership-based model, replacing it with a focus on establishing industry guidance. NZBA said in the announcement that it will pause all ongoing activities until the vote concludes and results are announced at the end of September, making it the second UN-backed net-zero industry organization to suspend activities this year. The banking climate alliance, backed by the UN Environment Programme finance initiative, was formed in 2021 with 43 members and at least tripled in size at one point, according to NZBA’s site. The organization’s website no longer contains a membership list or its signatory pledge; both links redirect to NZBA’s main webpage. Here’s a recap of how the organization got here. Even prior to Trump’s reelection in November, major U.S. banks and financial institutions had been subject to multiple Republican-led state probes and House Congressional investigations for being members of NZBA and other industry climate alliances. After the 2024 election, with Trump buoyed by Republican control of the House and Senate, six major U.S. banks — including five of the six largest U.S. banks — announced NZBA exits prior to the inauguration. Goldman Sachs was the first in December of last year, followed by Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup before the end of the year. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase left the alliance in early January. All six banks had been targets of separate state probes by Republican state attorneys general and state heads of agriculture. Following the bank exits, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton ended prior probes into Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. “Companies don’t want to step in the way of [Trump’s] agenda … they don’t want to jump in front of that freight train,” Arvin Vohra, CEO of energy-as-a-service provider Redaptive, told ESG Dive after the exodus of U.S. banks. Despite leaving NZBA, the banks have largely maintained their net-zero commitments and goals, with the exception of Wells Fargo — which dropped a 2050 net-zero financed emissions target in March. Another coalition of state attorneys general ended a probe into Wells Fargo shortly after the bank dropped its net-zero target. The U.S. defections were not contained to banks. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced it was exiting the UN-backed Net Zero Asset Managers initiative on Jan. 9, telling clients that the membership was creating confusion around the firm’s practices and making it subject to “legal inquiries from various public officials,” executives said in a reported letter. NZAM announced an operational pause shortly afterwards on Jan. 13, and Northern Trust Asset Management and J.P. Morgan Asset Management later left the climate alliance. The latter cited the pause as its reason for departing. Wall Street’s departure from NZBA first rippled north of the U.S. border to Canadian banks. Before the end of January, Canada’s six largest banks also announced their exits from NZBA. TD Bank, National Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce each announced their intent to depart on Jan. 20, coinciding with Trump’s inauguration in the U.S. Canada’s largest bank, the Royal Bank of Canada, departed Jan. 31. NZBA updated its guidelines for how banks should set climate targets in April, forgoing a prior requirement for members to strictly target limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The group’s updated guidance, instead, required signatories to align targets with limiting warming “to well below 2 [degrees Celsius], striving for 1.5°C.” On the same day the updated guidance was announced, Netherlands-based Triodos Bank exited the group and explicitly blamed the guidance’s lowered standards for its departure. The bank said in a release that the standards “fall short of the needed urgency to align loans and investments portfolios with the 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming scenario.” Outside of Triodos’ exit, all of the prior departures had been tightly grouped in time and location around Trump’s election and inauguration. The exodus jumped across the pond in July, after U.K.-based HSBC said it was disassociating from the climate alliance and U.K.-based Barclays also quit the alliance. The departures hopped borders again in early August, when Swiss bank UBS withdrew from the alliance. “As we look ahead, NZBA remains focused on supporting the many committed banks driving this transformation forward,” an NZBA spokesperson told ESG Dive after UBS’ exit. “The need for bold action from the banking sector has never been greater and NZBA is here to help deliver it.” In announcing the vote to move away from a membership-based model, NZBA is addressing a point of contention that Republican state and federal officials have raised in recent years. The officials have alleged that members of NZBA, NZAM and other alliances like Climate Action 100+ have committed antitrust violations through pledges the groups require to orient asset and financed emissions towards net-zero emissions. NZBA said Wednesday it recognizes there is a “major opportunity for banks and key stakeholders to build on” its work and “encourages the banking sector to remain steadfast in implementing their net-zero commitments.” “The steering group believes this is the most appropriate model to continue supporting banks across the globe to remain resilient and accelerate the real economy transition in line with the Paris Agreement, as well as to continue engagement with the global banking industry to develop further guidance and tools needed to support them and their clients,” NZBA’s Aug. 27 update said. Katrin Ganswindt, coal and divestment campaigner for German-based environmental nonprofit Urgewald, had pointed criticism following Wednesday’s announcement and told ESG Dive that “voluntary alliances like NZBA did not deliver.” “Fossil fuel finance needs effective regulation, which would also improve the financial system's resilience,” Ganswindt said in an emailed statement. “Central banks, bank regulators and oversight agencies should finally step up to the plate. They should start by drawing a clear line at the financing of fossil fuel expansion.” Before NZBA announced the vote, Trillium Asset Management Director of Shareholder Advocacy Andrea Ranger told ESG Dive that whether the various departures were to avoid the legal risks of potential antitrust allegations by U.S. political entities, “the fact of the matter is that [NZBA] oriented these companies toward a net-zero strategy.” “Ultimately, what we really want [the banks] to do is actually do the work,” Ranger said in an interview last week. “Whether they’re part of an alliance or not — I think it would be better if there were that collective momentum versus each company doing their own thing — but we just want them to do the work. And if that helped them get there, then that's great.” YOU MUST AGREE TO OUR TERMS OF USE AND PRIVACY POLICY. Already a subscriber? Sign in with your email above.

Title: Ethereum Play: BMNR Stock To $100?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN: BMNR) has surged 600% year-to-date, holding the world’s largest corporate Ethereum position of 1.7 million ETH valued at $8 billion. This far exceeds other corporate ETH holders, giving the company unmatched leverage to Ethereum price movements. With continued purchases underscoring management’s conviction, traditional metrics like revenue or margins become secondary—this is pure cryptocurrency exposure on a massive scale. But can the stock double again from here? The answer is yes. Below, we outline the potential drivers behind such a move. That said, if you want upside potential with less volatility than an individual stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—delivering more than 91% returns since inception. Also see – MongoDB: Up 30% Is MDB Stock Still A Buy? BitMine’s holding of 1.7 million ETH provides interesting opportunities, including strategic initiatives and institutional partnerships, that smaller holders cannot achieve. Ongoing purchases reinforce management’s confidence and bolster its leverage with crypto infrastructure providers. For the stock to double, two factors must align: Ethereum must appreciate in value, and the company must manage its treasury effectively. While the upside is immense, the risks scale equally. For instance, the stock once lost 88% of its value during the 2022 downturn. Ultimately, BitMine delivers unmatched Ethereum exposure through the public markets. But success depends almost entirely on the cryptocurrency’s trajectory, not traditional business fundamentals. Keep in mind, investing in individual stocks—especially those tied to cryptocurrencies—carries substantial risk. For broader exposure, explore the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a strong record of outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks have typically offered higher returns with less volatility than the benchmark—delivering a smoother ride, as seen in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Ethereum dominates despite ‘killer’ altcoins: ETFs boost ETH

Why is fresh institutional money flowing into ETH and not BTC? Ethereum surged as BlackRock accumulated $314 million and spot ETFs drew $455 million in inflows. Treasury firms added 3.56 million ETH, pushing it toward institutional adoption. Ethereum [ETH]’s momentum in the latter half of 2025 is proving hard to ignore. Beyond its record-breaking price surge, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is dominating the ETF arena and attracting deep-pocketed institutions. The latest signal came from BlackRock, which added nearly $315 million worth of ETH in recent transactions. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham revealed that BlackRock has quietly executed one of its largest Ethereum purchases yet, amassing $314.9 million worth of ETH across multiple transactions. The world’s top asset manager used ETF-linked wallets to scoop up Ethereum in tranches, with several 10,000 ETH transfers (worth around $46 million each) coming from Coinbase Prime hot wallets. Smaller frequent buys followed, such as a batch of 2,691 ETH. This accumulation isn’t happening in isolation. A new class of “Ethereum Treasury Firms,” publicly traded companies such as BitMine, SharpLink, and ETHZilla have also been adding ETH to their balance sheets. Collectively, these firms now hold over 3.7 million ETH, nearly 3% of the total supply. The timing of these purchases was critical. Ethereum traded at $4,578.88 at press time, up 3.3% in 24 hours and 9% on the week. Moreover, on the 26th of August, spot ETH ETFs posted $455 million of inflows, according to Farside Investors. Such momentum has fueled bullish forecasts, with Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine and Head of Research at Fundstrat, arguing that ETH remains undervalued and should be trading closer to $6,000. Even now, Solana [SOL], Avalanche [AVAX], Polygon [MATIC], Aptos [APT], and Sui [SUI] compete in niches such as gaming, high-speed transactions, and enterprise adoption. However, Ethereum has secured its dominance through Layer-2 scaling solutions and its role as the settlement layer of the ecosystem. As AMBCrypto previously noted, the outdated “Ethereum killer” label no longer applies. Instead, the industry is evolving into a multi-chain landscape where Ethereum remains the foundation while specialized chains thrive in parallel.

You won't want to start your day without it. By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)As August draws toward a close, bitcoin BTC$111,481.44 bulls may welcome the end of a modest pullback, with the largest cryptocurrency down around 4% for the month and 12% off its all-time high of $124,500. For now, it's little changed around $110,580, up less than 0.5% over 24 hours while ether (ETH) has added 3.4%. The CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the broader market, rose 2.7% in the same period. A negative end to August would halt a streak of four consecutive green months, the longest run since March last year. Encouragingly, August has held up better than in the past three years, and September should bring a pickup in trading activity as the holiday season winds down. On-chain data shows bitcoin traders used the Short-Term Holder Realized Price (STH-RP), currently $108,800, as support. This metric tracks the average acquisition price of coins moved on-chain in the past 155 days and excludes exchange reserves. In bull markets, the STH RP often acts as a key support level. The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR), which measures profits or losses on coins younger than 155 days, indicates that short-term investors are currently selling at a loss. Historically, this behavior tends to appear near local market bottoms. But capitulation has yet to be seen. Meanwhile, the options market points to a “max pain” level at $116,000. Max pain is the strike price at which the largest number of options expire worthless, generally causing the greatest financial pain to option holders and greatest benefit to options sellers. With this level above the spot price, it suggests upside relief could be on the horizon. Beyond crypto, U.S. trade tensions escalated again as Washington imposed 50% tariffs on India, doubling earlier duties after talks broke down. The move, aimed at curbing India’s purchases of Russian oil, highlights strained ties between President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Analysts warn of falling exports, job losses and a potential 1% drag on GDP growth. For bitcoin traders, the key range to watch is $113,500 to $117,200, where the CME futures gap remains open. Historically, such gaps tend to be filled, making this zone one to monitor closely. Stay alert.

Title: 30 Aug Presale, Bitcoin Swift Arrives As Solana Makes Headlines

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Crypto adherents are keeping a close eye on one of the most talked-about giants in the market: Solana. Solana has rallied by nearly 10% in late August, currently trading between $187 and $206, with analysts predicting a potential breakout toward $250–$300 if ETF clarity is achieved. SOL is demonstrating the strength of institutional interest, with Solana attracting $1.25 billion from Pantera Capital. Alongside these heavyweights, another project is creating shockwaves: Bitcoin Swift (BTC3). Already, $1.3 million has been raised, with more than 5,500 users having joined. An early launch has been officially announced for August 30, accompanied by a massive bonus structure for participants. Solana continues to impress with high throughput and low costs, attracting big names like BlackRock and CME as it becomes a cornerstone of tokenized assets. The asset showcases the strength of blockchain adoption today. However, neither Solana pays its holders direct, programmable staking rewards at every stage. That is what makes Bitcoin Swift different. BTC3 is designed to reward participants today, not just after launch, and its presale payouts prove that. Bitcoin Swift is not just another token. It is a next-generation defi operating system. At its core is Proof-of-Yield (PoY), a dynamic system that distributes rewards based on network activity, governance, and environmental efficiency. The result is programmable rewards sent at the end of each presale stage. BTC3 launches first on Solana, giving ultra-fast transactions and fees below $0.01 while tapping into an ecosystem of over 400 projects. Then, in 2026, it will migrate to its own blockchain via a 1:1 trustless bridge, scaling up to institutional adoption. The countdown has begun. Stage 7 is the last stage before launch, and only three days remain. To mark this milestone, BTC3 introduced the “Everything Must Go Bonus Event,” rewarding the fastest 130: The numbers are staggering. A Tier 4 contributing $10,000 secures $30,000 worth of BTC3 instantly at presale price. If BTC3 trades at $15 post-launch, that position skyrockets beyond $60,000. The math explains why this final stage is moving so quickly. BTC3 is capped at 45 million tokens. Allocation is carefully structured: 50% for PoY rewards (22.5M), 30% for presale (13.5M), 15% for liquidity pools (6.75M), and 5% for team and reserves (2.25M). This ensures long-term sustainability and scarcity. Additionally, the roadmap demonstrates that BTC3 is more than just hype. This trajectory ensures BTC3 is a project built to deliver both short-term excitement and long-term adoption. Security is equally strong. Cyberscope Audit, Solidproof Audit, and Spywolf Audit have reviewed BTC3. On top of this, full KYC verification has been completed, making it one of the safest opportunities on the market. The crypto community is buzzing with excitement as influencers dissect BTC3’s potential: These insights are driving even more attention as the presale draws to a close. Solana is proving that institutional adoption is here. However, Bitcoin Swift combines both short-term explosive rewards and a roadmap that stretches into 2026, giving it the edge. With only 3 days left before its August 30 launch, $1.3m raised, and bonus events rewarding speed, BTC3 is the most urgent opportunity in the market today.

Title: Nvidia's earnings report will help to show whether the AI boom is overhyped or gaining steam

Chipmaker Nvidia is poised to release a quarterly report that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that’s still gathering mome... SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum. Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth. The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom. This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007. While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism. But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again. Investors were recently spooked by a combination of an MIT report that said 95% of AI pilots fail and comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman floating the idea that the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble. And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion. Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion. Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand. Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year. And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter. Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country — a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Trump’s Tariff Tidal Wave Could Drown This Coconut Water Juggernaut
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2025/08/27/trumps-tariff-tidal-wave-could-drown-this-coconut-water-juggernaut/

BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. What do you do when 96% of your revenue comes from coconut water and 100% of your supply comes from tropical countries targeted by Donald Trump with high tariffs? This is exactly the situation confronting one of the nation’s hottest small cap companies today, $516 million (revs) Vita-Coco of New York City, the leading maker of coconut water. Its biggest source of coconuts, has heretofore been Brazil, a country now squarely in the crosshairs of a proposed 50% tariff, courtesy of the Trump administration. Its six other sources for coconuts aren’t much better: Philippines (tariff:19%), Malaysia (25%), Vietnam (32%), Indonesia (32%) Thailand (36%) and Sri Lanka (46%). Still, you wouldn’t know that Vita Coco was facing a Trump tariff nightmare given the company’s bullish tone—or its stock performance. Shares are up nearly 32% over the past 12 months, outperforming many better-known consumer-staples names. Even with the stock down roughly 5% year-to-date as the broader market rallies, Wall Street is shrugging off Vita Coco’s inevitable pricing pressure. “Brazil is really a nonissue for us,” insists co-founder and executive chairman Michael Kirban. “We started working on reallocating our Brazil supply, which historically goes to the United States, to supply Europe and Canada, several weeks ago.” The main source of supply for Europe, meanwhile—the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Malaysia—will now all shift to the U.S. “This is something we can pull the trigger on really quickly,” reasons Kirban, seemingly unconcerned about the high tariffs in his alternative source countries. He goes on: “With decreasing ocean freight rates and pricing [increases] we took earlier this year to mitigate the initial 10% baseline tariffs, we think we are in a good position.” Co-founder Kirban says he doesn’t expect to pass any further price hikes in the coming months, but this may be wishful thinking if Trump doesn't back away from his harsh tariffs on tropical countries. Here is what Vita Coco CEO Martin Roper said on the Q2 earnings call held a few weeks ago: “Our planned U.S.-based price increase in May to cover inflationary cost of goods pressures produced an approximately 7% increase at U.S. food retailers according to Circana over the quarter.” However the May price increase does not include another recent price increase implemented in the current quarter, which Vita Coco management refuses to provide Forbes details on. For now, Wall Street is putting its faith in Vita Coco management. By working with seven of the largest coconut processors in the world, Vita Coco currently controls roughly 40% of the U.S. coconut-water market, far ahead of smaller competitors like Goya and Harmless Harvest. “Coca-Cola tried to enter this market, buying Zico, and Pepsi also failed,” Larry Carlin, an equity analyst at $8 billion (assets) Conestoga Capital Advisors who is hopeful that Vita Coco’s strong position will give it more flexibility in the face of looming tariffs. “They’ve developed a supply chain with substantial barriers to entry,” adds Carlin. Founded by two friends in 2003 after a chance bar room encounter in Manhattan, Vita Coco’s met with early success in its first decade, thanks in part to celebrity investors including Madonna, Demi Moore, and Matthew McConnaghy. However about a decade into their journey growing pains hit—thin margins, distribution hiccups and a rocky 2021 IPO kept many institutions away. But over the past two years the company has executed a disciplined turnaround, tightening its supply chain after the Covid pandemic. It has also expanded its portfolio of offerings into protein-infused PWR LIFT, aluminum-canned Ever & Ever water, and most recently, the coconut-milk-based beverage line Vita Coco Treats. Up until the onslaught of Trump’s tariffs, Vita-Coco was the envy of the Russell 2000, appearing near the top of Forbes Best Small Companies ranking in 2024. The stock is up 133% since its IPO, and five-fold from its low in 2022. On the company’s second quarter earnings call, held July 30th, CFO Corey Baker noted that Vita Coco is pursuing a formal tariff exemption request with U.S. trade officials. If that isn’t granted, management basically told shareholders to brace themselves: “If [the 50% Brazilian tariff is] enacted, we would ultimately need to pass through price increases,” says Baker. “Even under a worst-case scenario, we believe we could pass through price if necessary while maintaining share.” On Wall Street, six of the ten analysts covering Vita Coco rate it a “buy”, while the other four give it a “hold” rating, often interpreted as “sell” by investors. Short sellers have begun to circle its stock. A 23-page March 2025 report by UK-based short-seller NINGI Research accused Vita Coco of numerous underlying business problems including failed attempts at diversification, supply chain foul ups and millions in CEO and insider stock sales. NINGI’s main argument was that the company was an unsustainable growth story: “Vita Coco is nothing more than a one-trick pony" and an "operational basket case,” it wrote. The report's most impactful claims were that Vita Coco had lost its large private-label contract with Costco due to supply chain mismanagement, which would lead to a significant revenue hit. While Vita Coco publicly refuted the report as containing "inaccuracies and mischaracterizations," subsequent public statements and financial results support NINGI’s allegations about the lost Costco contract. The company's Q2 2025 earnings report confirmed a significant 36.5% decline in private-label sales; What’s more, Costco now appears to have stopped selling Vita Coco and is instead stocking its own coconut water under its in-house private label brand, Kirkland Signature. Today, a 12-pack of Costco's own Kirkland coconut water sells for $12.99 versus $19.59 for a 12 pack of Vita Coco at Target. Vita Coco has also publicly acknowledged that inventory constraints in 2024 led to "unacceptable private label service levels." Despite these issues, Vita Coco bulls maintain that the company’s core branded coconut water business is strong. Ever the optimist, Kirban is unfazed. “Sales are continuing to perform really nicely. So I think consumers are willing to pay,” says Kirban, referring to his tariff related price hikes. “This is a product that comes from a tree. It's not created in a lab, and it is three and a half times the electrolytes of the leading sport drink.”

Title: Will AI Be the Next Dot-Com Bubble?

As AI continues to rake in funds despite questions about long-term profitability, some experts are calling for more diversification. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Is it time for investors to slow their AI roll? Some experts think so. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made headlines last week when he described the AI craze as a bubble. Combined with ChatGPT-5’s botched rollout earlier this month and some signs of sliding among tech stocks, that prompted investors to question whether the AI boom is set to go bust in the near future, like the dot-com bubble of the late ’90s. Still, AI-focused ETFs continue to hit the market, with VettaFi listing 48 in its database, and expert outlooks are mixed. “I think it’s important to be aware of the risk,” said Claire Cantalupo, senior market analyst at InvesTech Research. “It doesn’t necessarily mean AI is going to crash tomorrow.” There are a few things to look for when evaluating a possible bubble, Cantalupo said. One is a paradigm shift: a new technology or innovation leading to a surge in optimism and high valuations, with investors losing their sense of risk and reward. Another is “a universal belief that this time is different.” AI could, and probably will, change the world, she added, but it may also be causing inflated valuations that aren’t sustainable. During the dot-com boom, for example, equipment provider Cisco ranked as a major player, briefly becoming the world’s most valuable company with a market cap topping $500 billion. But it lost 90% of its value in the two years after the bubble burst in 2000. “The unfortunate reality is the top 10 companies in the S&P make up 40% of it by market capitalization,” Cantalupo said. “So investors who think they’re diversified by investing in index funds are actually far more exposed to just a small basket of stocks than they think they are.” Other potential indicators that the AI boom is a bubble include: Artificially Sweet. The S&P 500 continues to climb because of a few tech stocks — Nvidia, Meta and others — with massive AI projects. The projects could lead to too much hype, said Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. Meta, for instance, has reportedly offered huge compensation packages to AI engineers that could lose value if the company’s stock falls. Still, Colello expressed optimism, based in part on continued demand for Nvidia’s products. “Certainly, there will be businesses that fail to live up to lofty valuations and times where AI expands too quickly,” he said. “However, we don’t think these dynamics are plaguing the large AI leaders just yet.” There isn’t an ETF for everything, but the volume of leveraged products coming to market shows a strategy of filling any voids. Cash is king, but income-generating mutual funds and ETFs are increasingly being used for clients, Nasdaq found. The company’s massive asset moves may, in part, reflect institutional investors’ entry into the industry, particularly crypto. Meg Ryan, a lecturer at Harvard with a background in military law, will take over next month as director of the SEC Division of Enforcement. The latest ETFs from F/m Investments and Compoundr help institutional investors avoid taxes on income distributions. Crypto assets are increasingly available as spot ETFs like IBIT, and investors may have a fear of missing out, despite the volatility. ETF volatility plays a large role in the gap between returns for investors and for funds as a whole, Morningstar data show. A set of Vanguard funds subadvised by Wellington will mark the first active stock-picking ETFs in the company’s fleet. Energy demand is rising globally, in part because of AI use, and a handful of ETFs focused on nuclear energy stand to benefit. Cyclical industries can provide some regularity for ETF investors, but not without downsides. The filing marks President Trump’s latest move to bring his spot bitcoin strategy to the ETF market. Will advisors bite? Following revised jobs reports data, Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics head. His successor choice at the BLS may raise red flags. © 2025 The Daily Upside

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.fj5u93ykx Share article Print article To mark the 250th anniversary of her birth, we’re pitting Jane Austen’s much-loved novels against each other in a battle of wit, charm and romance. Six leading Austen experts have made their case for her ultimate novel, but the winner is down to you. Cast your vote in the poll at the end of the article, and let us know the reason for your choice in the comments. This is Jane Austen Fight Club – it’s bonnets at dawn… Championed by Lucy Thompson, lecturer in 19th-century literature and creative writing, Aberystwyth University Sense and Sensibility is Austen’s most quietly radical novel. As her first published work, it may be less polished than her later fiction, but it is no less incisive. It lays bare the emotional cost of living in a world governed by reputation, family obligation and gendered expectation. Excluded from inheritance and displaced from their home, the Dashwood sisters must navigate constant scrutiny. Through Elinor and Marianne, Austen dramatises two strategies for survival in a society obsessed with appearances. Born from an earlier epistolary draft, the novel retains a sharp interest in how information circulates and misleads. Gossip doesn’t just constrain; it distorts. Letters are spied upon, conversations overheard. Assumptions take on the weight of fact. In this world, everyone watches – but not everyone truly sees. Sense and Sensibility may wear a quieter face than Emma or Pride and Prejudice, but it is Austen’s sharpest early critique of how appearances govern lives. This article is part of a series commemorating the 250th anniversary of Jane Austen’s birth. Despite having published only six books, she is one of the best-known authors in history. These articles explore the legacy and life of this incredible writer. Championed by Andrew McInnes, reader in English literature, Edge Hill University Everyone already knows the best Austen novel: Pride and Prejudice. Why? Elizabeth Bennet. Lizzy is so charismatic that you might mistake the novel’s title for an abstract problem, and not Darcy’s pride versus her prejudice. We share her prejudices because Austen makes them so delicious. We roll our eyes at Mrs Bennet because Lizzy finds her exasperating. Wickham is seductive because he satisfies our inner bitch. And we fall in love with Darcy alongside Lizzy. Pride and Prejudice is the funniest and sexiest of Austen’s novels. In it, she allows herself a swoon-worthy romance without a hitch. Unlike Northanger Abbey’s Henry Tilney, Darcy doesn’t fall in love because Lizzy adores him, but falls first. Darcy is a complex man – shy, domineering, funny – and not a drip like Eds Ferrars (Sense and Sensibility) or Bertram (Mansfield Park). And unlike Emma, Lizzy builds healthy relationships with other women. Austen called Pride and Prejudice “too light and bright and sparkling” and joked that it could do with an essay on Walter Scott or Napoleon. But we know that would be a crime. It is just light and bright and sparkling enough to outshine the others. Championed by Amanda Vickery, professor in early modern history, Queen Mary University of London Pride and Prejudice is often the first grown-up novel young girls read, but Mansfield Park is the only Austen novel about a little girl growing up. All Austen’s fictions are versions of the female-centred courtship novel, usually covering a single year, with the heroine safely married to a deserving gentleman by the last page. Yet her heroines are mostly formed young women. Only in Mansfield Park do we meet our heroine as a little girl – and a puny and cowering little girl at that. Mansfield Park is Austen’s bildungsroman (the novel of becoming) on a par with that other girls’ classic, Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre (1847). Like poor, plain Jane, Fanny Price is a girl of no consequence – a Cinderella figure in a mansion of the rich and selfish. Fanny is shy, frail and physically timid, but she is not a moral coward. She learns to bear her lot with dignity, and to hold fast to what she believes. By volume three, Fanny is at last the centre of her own story. Mansfield Park is not just a love story, it is a life story. Championed by Ruvani Ranasinha, professor of global literature, King’s College London Emma Woodhouse is Jane Austen’s most vividly realised, proto-feminist heroine. Witty, clever and attractive, Emma is supremely self-confident and flawed. She challenges every expectation of female propriety and is full of contradictions: self-centred yet deeply attached to her hypochondriac, indulgent father; snobbish but kind. Emma revels in meddling in the romantic lives of others, especially her protégée, Harriet Smith. When her carefully laid plans unravel, the busybody makes mortifying mistakes and learns self-knowledge: “It darted through her with the speed of an arrow, that Mr Knightley must marry no-one but herself!” All Austen’s novels are shot through with the awareness of the role of wealth and class in marriage. But Emma – “an heiress of thirty thousand pounds” – is free from the intense competition among the women for young men with positions and prospects. At the same time, she attracts men like Mr Elton seeking women with landed connections and dowries. This is why the novel both responds to Austen’s historical moment and speaks to our own. Championed by Octavia Cox, departmental lecturer in English literature, University of Oxford Northanger Abbey is a riot of jokes. Nobody and nothing is spared: not the heroine, convention, society – even readers. There’s everything marvellous you’d expect from an Austen novel (sharp satire of patriarchy and socioeconomic weaponisation, laughter at human absurdity and pompousness, beautifully wrought witty expression, a rollicking good yarn, irony), but with extra sass. Its bombastic intrusive authorial narrative voice (perhaps the closest we get to Austen’s own), constantly makes in-jokes with readers about the action. It’s Austen’s most meta-fictional text, playing with readers’ expectations about novels (for example, joking that her novel, ironically, “is a new circumstance in romance” despite depicting nothing “new in common life”). Its “defence of the novel” passage is a proto-feminist rallying call-to-arms for female authors to celebrate each other’s work. Northanger Abbey’s meta-fictionality reveals much about Austen’s aim and style as an author, making it a must-read for all Austen-lovers. Oh, and it’s funny. Damned funny. Championed by Richard de Ritter, lecturer in English literature, University of Leeds Persuasion contains the greatest love letter in all English literature. It is the culmination of a slow-burning romance between the heroine, Anne Elliot, and Captain Frederick Wentworth, the man she has loved for eight long years. “You pierce my soul,” Wentworth writes to Anne with striking vulnerability: “I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late.” (Spoiler: he is not too late.) The brilliance of Persuasion lies in the depiction of its complex heroine. At 27, Anne Elliot is older and wiser than Austen’s earlier protagonists. Disregarded by her comically narcissistic family, the depth of Anne’s personality is revealed by Austen’s prose style, which is at its most luminous and expressive. Readers are plunged into the mind of the novel’s heroine. We witness her innermost thoughts and feelings as she negotiates the awkwardness, excitement and, finally, the sheer joy of embracing a future with Wentworth. Persuasion is the final novel that Austen completed before her death in 1817: she was at the peak of her powers. It is her most moving and her greatest work. Now the experts have made their case, it’s your turn to decide which of Austen’s six completed novels is her best work. Vote in the poll below to and see if our other readers agree with you.

Title: Fulfillment Compared: Amazon, Walmart, Shopify

Time Published: 2025-08-27T09:36:45Z

Ecommerce operators tired of picking, packing, and posting parcels can turn to massive marketplaces and the leading ecommerce platform for help. For years, Fulfillment by Amazon, Walmart Fulfillment Services, and the Shopify Fulfillment Network have helped sellers store inventory, ship orders, and even manage returns. The services share a common purpose of providing ecommerce order fulfillment but differ in structure, at least a little. Understanding those differences starts with a closer look at how each network works. FBA, SFN, and WFS aim to make ecommerce fulfillment fast and easy. Launched in 2006, FBA is the most recognized third-party fulfillment option on this list owing to its close association with the company’s marketplace. FBA’s most important feature may be exposure. Items sold on the Amazon Marketplace and fulfilled through FBA display the Prime badge on Amazon.com. The badge is important because about 75% of U.S. Amazon shoppers are Prime members and likely filter for Prime-eligible products. Using FBA begins in Seller Central. Merchants prep inventory to Amazon’s specifications and ship it to designated warehouses. Amazon distributes stock across its network and automatically routes orders. When customers make a purchase, Amazon employees pick, pack, and ship the order, which is often delivered within one to two days. Amazon also processes returns, with refunds issued directly to the customer. Amazon’s Multi-Channel Fulfillment allows retailers to use Amazon’s warehouses, staff, and shipping network to fulfill orders placed on external platforms such as eBay or their own websites. Walmart launched its FBA competitor, Walmart Fulfillment Services, in 2020 at the height of Covid. The timing was coincidental as the retail giant had planned the start, but the pandemic-induced ecommerce surge that followed might have helped get things rolling. Functionally, WFS operates similarly to FBA. Sellers apply through Walmart’s Seller Center. Once approved, those merchants send inventory to WFS warehouses. Walmart’s system routes orders automatically. There is even a “Fulfilled by Walmart” badge with a two-day delivery promise for Walmart Marketplace items. Two WFS differences stand out relative to FBA: returns and price. Orders placed on the Walmart Marketplace and fulfilled with WFS are returnable to nearly any of Walmart’s physical locations, offering a level of customer convenience. And WFS claims to be approximately 15% less expensive than FBA despite having a higher base rate, the apparent difference coming from additional fees for setup, storage, size, and similar. Walmart claims that WFS is about 15% cheaper than other marketplace fulfillment services. WFS is primarily for Walmart Marketplace sellers, but in September 2024, WFS began its own multichannel fulfillment service similar to Amazon’s MCF. Thus sellers can use WFS in combination with an internet store or other ecommerce channels. Essentially an app, Shopify Fulfillment Network makes it relatively easy for merchants to process Shopify orders through third-party fulfillment services. Sellers enable the SFN app in Shopify’s admin, connect catalogs, and send inventory to partner warehouses. Orders from Shopify and other connected channels flow into the system, which routes shipments to the closest node. Fulfillment partners store inventory and manage returns. Perhaps the key difference between SFN and FBA or WFS is control. A Shopify store owns its own brand and customer relationships. In contrast, FBA and WFS customers may have purchased directly from Amazon or Walmart, and they will most certainly recognize the brands’ packaging when the orders arrive. SFN has an eventful history. Shopify launched the service in 2019 with a $1 billion investment. In 2022, it acquired Deliverr for $2 billion, only to eventually sell it to Flexport, which became the default in-app service. Since the sale, Shopify sellers using SFN can work with several leading fulfillment providers, including ShipBob, Shipfusion, ShipMonk, DHL Fulfillment, and Amazon MCF. Merchants can utilize custom packaging with the SFN, manage multiple channels from a single dashboard, and display Shopify’s Shop Promise badge with two- to three-day deliveries. FBA, WFS, and SFN all offer comprehensive ecommerce fulfillment, and in at least a few ways are interchangeable. The services are not mutually exclusive. A single store can utilize FBA and WFS for its respective marketplace channels, while employing SFN for orders via Shopify and its TikTok shop. The takeaway? There are many excellent options for ecommerce order fulfillment. Share this article: Copyright © 2005 - 2025. Practical Ecommerce® is a registered trademark of Confluence Distribution, Inc.

Title: Loma Larga looming large: why fast-tracking mines leads to financial and social blowback

Environmental defenders gather to announce several legal actions protesting the arbitrary decision of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition (“MAATE”) to grant an environmental licence for exploitation to Dundee Precious Metals. Photo courtesy: Federation of Indigenous and Campesino Organizations of Azuay Province. In the face of economic uncertainty and a changing global order, governments around the world are engaging in a growing trend of deregulation of the mining industry and fast-tracking of extractive projects. Among these is a controversial Free Trade Agreement between Canada and Ecuador that heavily favours corporate interests over human rights and the environment. Yet the long-term environmental impacts and heavy social backlash that come from cutting corners only lead to worsening community relations for companies and increased financial risk for investors. As Canada is the home of about half of the world’s publicly listed mining companies, Canadian companies are likely to be increasingly disrupted by community conflicts both at home and abroad as a result of this broad deregulatory push. One such conflict is arising from Dundee Precious Metals’ Loma Larga gold mine in Southern Ecuador. Earlier this month, as investors gathered in a boardroom on Bay Street in Toronto for a special shareholders meeting, a coalition of Ecuadorian organizations and their Canadian allies filed a complaint with the Ontario Securities Commission against the company for allegedly misleading its shareholders about serious legal threats to its Loma Larga project. The proposed Loma Larga gold mining project has been marred by controversy and social opposition since its inception. It is located in the páramo de Kimsakocha, an ecologically sensitive high-altitude wetland that is crucial for climate change adaptation and water security for downstream communities, including Cuenca, the third-largest city in Ecuador. Dundee acquired the project in 2021, and it has been under a court-ordered suspension since 2022 — upheld again in 2023 — amid ongoing legal battles related to safe drinking-water guarantees for those downstream communities. The project’s Indigenous consultation process is now also being challenged by the Indigenous community of San Pedro de Escaleras in the courts due to allegations of irregularities. This presents a bleak outlook for Dundee, as there are legal precedents in Ecuador for permanently shutting down a mining project and revoking its licenses on the basis of both environmental concerns and a lack of social license — yet the OSC complaint alleges that none of this information has been transparently conveyed to investors. Under Ontario law, companies that are publicly traded are required to disclose certain legal risks — such as the court challenges Dundee is facing over the Loma Larga project — if they could result in the lengthy suspension or even permanent closure of the mine, especially when there are legal precedents that would support that result. These measures are in place to protect investors. Yet, Dundee has continued to paint a rosy picture to its shareholders, announcing in a July press release, that it had received its environmental licence and “successfully completed” the prior informed Indigenous consultation process for the Loma Larga project. The legal challenge to its consultation process is conspicuously absent from the release, as are the two referenda in 2019 and 2022 where downstream communities voted overwhelmingly against the mine. Dundee’s press release further claims that it “fulfilled the requirements of the August 2023 ruling by the Provincial Court of Azuay” — but fails to mention one of the other key conditions for the suspension to be lifted: The courts must accept two reports on how to guarantee safe drinking water to the downstream communities, one of which, authored by the utility company for the municipality of Cuenca (ETAPA), is highly critical of the Loma Larga project. Until these reports are accepted and reconciled, the mine remains suspended. The Loma Larga project is an inherently risky endeavour. It has faced staunch resistance for the last three decades. The Federation of Indigenous and Campesino Organizations of Azuay province (FOA) has organized highway blockades demanding Dundee’s environmental licence be revoked and a full moratorium on mining in the paramos. Even under the pro-extractive Noboa government, the persistent controversy surrounding the gold mine forced Ecuador’s minister of energy and mines to announce another suspension of all work on the project, until Dundee’s environmental impact study has been adequately disseminated to the public. It’s clear that some of Dundee’s shareholders are paying attention — major investing firm Blackrock has already chosen to decrease its risk by dropping its percentage holding from 12.35 per cent to 8.48 per cent. While the Ontario Securities Commission takes time to conduct an investigation into Dundee’s pattern of lack of disclosure, shareholders should take this time to press Dundee for answers. And when all signs point to trouble ahead for the Loma Larga project, hopefully they will see that it’s not worth the risk. Ultimately, the best way to safeguard financial investment is to ensure high standards of environmental and human rights due diligence, rather than prioritizing corporate interests. This protects not just people and the planet, but also investors. With more deregulation and less accountability, companies such as Dundee can mislead shareholders about the viability of their projects and investors might find their portfolios on the wrong side of the law.

Title: Why investors are on tenterhooks for Nvidia’s latest earnings report
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/27/why-investors-are-on-tenterhooks-for-nvidias-latest-earnings-report

The US chip giant is considered a bellwether for both the AI industry and Wall Street. By Erin Hale Chip giant Nvidia is set to release its latest earnings report – and the results could move the entire US stock market. Over the past two years, the chipmaker has risen to become the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of more than $4 trillion. When Nvidia announces its earnings on Wednesday, investors will get to see how the tech giant has been faring amid the tumult of President Donald Trump’s trade salvoes and concerns about whether artificial intelligence has been overhyped. Nvidia specialises in making the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power AI, including the Blackwell B200, marketed as the world’s most powerful chip. The California-based company’s chips have become essential to the world’s largest tech companies, including Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, since AI exploded into the mainstream with the release of OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in November 2022. The company’s portfolio also includes data centres and gaming. Nvidia posted annual revenue of $130.5bn for the last fiscal year, which ended in late January. Analysts will be examining various metrics, including the company’s quarterly revenue. Nvidia’s revenue has been growing at breakneck speed for the past several years, thanks to the AI boom and the surge in demand for its chips. Nvidia posted triple-digit revenue growth for five straight quarters between mid-2023 and 2024, according to company filings. Since then, annual revenue growth has coasted in the high double digits. Last quarter, the company reported revenue of $44.1bn, a 69 percent increase from the same period a year ago. While such figures would be the envy of any company, the firm’s explosive performance has also raised questions about how long its stellar run can last. In advance of its forthcoming earnings report – which covers the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 – Nvidia has said it expects revenue of $45bn plus or minus 2 percent. Analysts have predicted revenue of up to $46bn, or 53 percent growth year-on-year. The earnings report is also expected to show signs of whiplash from the Trump administration’s tariff war. In April, Trump banned Nvidia from selling its H20 chip – specially designed for the Chinese market – to China. At the time, Nvidia said the ban would cost the company $8bn. Trump later walked back the ban when Nvidia agreed to share 15 percent of its H20 chip sales with the US government, a deal that was finalised on August 11, two weeks after the end of its second quarter. As Silicon Valley pours billions into AI, some observers, such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have questioned whether there is a bubble. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is, yes,” Altman told The Verge in an interview earlier this month. He is not the only one who is worried. Analysts have drawn parallels to the collapse of the “Nifty Fifty” in the 1970s, said Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management in the United Kingdom. The Nifty Fifty was a group of 50 of the most valuable companies in the US, including Xerox and IBM. Though highly profitable, the firms became highly overvalued in the late 1960s and early 70s. When the bubble burst following the 1973-74 stock market crash, the value of Nifty Fifty stocks fell by more than 50 percent. “They were fantastic companies, but they were trading on the wrong price,” Sai told Al Jazeera. “This is the old notion of you could be a great company, but not a great stock if the price is wrong.” Five decades later, some investors are asking whether the “Magnificent Seven” – Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla – could be overvalued as well. Valuations have soared into the trillions of dollars on the back of the AI boom, although there is some divergence within the group, with Apple and Tesla faring less well recently. Amazon recently said it expects to spend $85bn on AI over the next year, while Microsoft predicts it will spend $100bn. AI has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise slowing economy that has been undergoing upheaval since Trump took office. “Growth is dwindling in other sectors, but there is this very small, niche, concentrated pocket of hyper growth,” Sai said. “This suddenly becomes a much bigger contributor to US GDP growth than it would have been in a normal phase of the cycle.” Corporate spending on AI has been likened to an arms race, but tech giants – and Nvidia customers – will also sooner or later need to show investors that their betting on the sector will lead to profits. US tech giants are already facing challenges from companies like China’s DeepSeek, which made global headlines in January when it unveiled a powerful but much cheaper AI model. So far, innovation does not appear to be translating into higher returns. In a recent survey by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 95 percent of enterprises looked at reported no return on their AI investments despite the billions ploughed into the sector. Because of its sky-high valuation, Nvidia alone makes up almost 8 percent of the S&P500 – the benchmark index of 500 top companies listed on the US stock market. That means Nvidia’s earnings have the potential to have a significant impact, good or bad, on the stock market as a whole. Big movements in Nvidia’s stock price have triggered swings in the S&P 500 of 1 percent or more in the past. After Nvidia’s earnings results in February sent its share price down more than 8 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Nvidia's quarterly report will gauge the temperature of the AI craze

Chipmaker Nvidia is poised to release a quarterly report that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that’s still gathering mome... SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum. Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth. The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom. This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007. While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism. But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again. Investors were recently spooked by a combination of an MIT report that said 95% of AI pilots fail and comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman floating the idea that the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble. And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion. Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion. Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand. Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year. And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter. Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country — a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Editor's Note: For those of you reading via email, I recommend opening this in a browser so you can use the Table of Contents. This is my longest newsletter - a 16,000-word-long opus - and if you like it, please subscribe to my premium newsletter. Thanks for reading! In the last two years I've written no less than 500,000 words, with many of them dedicated to breaking both existent and previous myths about the state of technology and the tech industry itself. While I feel no resentment — I really enjoy writing, and feel privileged to be able to write about this and make money doing so — I do feel that there is a massive double standard between those perceived as "skeptics" and "optimists." To be skeptical of AI is to commit yourself to near-constant demands to prove yourself, and endless nags of "but what about?" with each one — no matter how small — presented as a fact that defeats any points you may have. Conversely, being an "optimist" allows you to take things like AI 2027 — which I will fucking get to — seriously to the point that you can write an entire feature about fan fiction in the New York Times and nobody will bat an eyelid. In any case, things are beginning to fall apart. Two of the actual reporters at the New York Times (rather than a "columnist") reported out last week that Meta is yet again "restructuring" its AI department for the fourth time, and that it’s considering "downsizing the A.I. division overall," which sure doesn't seem like something you'd do if you thought AI was the future. Meanwhile, the markets are also thoroughly spooked by an MIT study covered by Fortune that found that 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing, and though MIT NANDA has now replaced the link to the study with a Google Form to request access, you can find the full PDF here, in the kind of move that screams "PR firm wants to try and set up interviews." Not for me, thanks! In any case, the report is actually grimmer than Fortune made it sound, saying that "95% of organizations are getting zero return [on generative AI]." The report says that "adoption is high, but transformation is low," adding that "...few industries show the deep structural shifts associated with past general-purpose technologies such as new market leaders, disrupted business models, or measurable changes in customer behavior." Yet the most damning part was the "Five Myths About GenAI in the Enterprise," which is probably the most wilting takedown of this movement I've ever seen: These are brutal, dispassionate points that directly deal with the most common boosterisms. Generative AI isn't transforming anything, AI isn't replacing anyone, enterprises are trying to adopt generative AI but it doesn't fucking work, and the thing holding back AI is the fact it doesn't fucking work. This isn't a case where "the enterprise" is suddenly going to save these companies, because the enterprise already tried, and it isn't working. An incorrect read of the study has been that the "learning gap" that makes these things less useful, when the study actually says that "...the fundamental gap that defines the GenAI divide [is that users resist tools that don't adapt, model quality fails without context, and UX suffers when systems can't remember." This isn't something you learn your way out of. The products don't do what they're meant to do, and people are realizing it. Nevertheless, boosters will still find a way to twist this study to mean something else. They'll claim that AI is still early, that the opportunity is still there, that we "didn't confirm that the internet or smartphones were productivity boosting," or that we're in "the early days" of AI, somehow, three years and hundreds of billions and thousands of articles in. I'm tired of having the same arguments with these people, and I'm sure you are too. No matter how much blindly obvious evidence there is to the contrary they will find ways to ignore it. They continually make smug comments about people "wishing things would be bad" or suggesting you are stupid — and yes, that is their belief! — for not believing generative AI is disruptive. Today, I’m going to give you the tools to fight back against the AI boosters in your life. I’m going to go into the generalities of the booster movement — the way they argue, the tropes they cling to, and the ways in which they use your own self-doubt against you. They’re your buddy, your boss, a man in a gingham shirt at Epic Steakhouse who won't leave you the fuck alone, a Redditor, a writer, a founder or a simple con artist — whoever the booster in your life is, I want you to have the words to fight them with. So, this is my longest newsletter ever, and I built it for quick reference - and, for the first time, gave you a Table of Contents. So, an AI booster is not, in many cases, an actual fan of artificial intelligence. People like Simon Willison or Max Woolf who actually work with LLMs on a daily basis don’t see the need to repeatedly harass everybody, or talk down to them about their unwillingness to pledge allegiance to the graveyard smash of generative AI. In fact, the closer I’ve found somebody to actually building things with LLMs, the less likely they are to emphatically argue that I’m missing out by not doing so myself. No, the AI booster is symbolically aligned with generative AI. They are fans in the same way that somebody is a fan of a sports team, their houses emblazoned with every possible piece of tat they can find, their Sundays living and dying by the success of the team, except even fans of the Dallas Cowboys have a tighter grasp on reality. Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are two of the most notable boosters, and — as I’ll get into later in this piece — neither of them have a consistent or comprehensive knowledge of AI. Nevertheless, they will insist that “everybody is using AI for everything” — a statement that even a booster should realize is incorrect based on the actual abilities of the models. But that’s because it isn’t about what’s actually happening, it’s about allegiance. AI symbolizes something to the AI booster — a way that they’re better than other people, that makes them superior because they (unlike “cynics” and “skeptics”) are able to see the incredible potential in the future of AI, but also how great it is today, though they never seem to be able to explain why outside of “it replaced search for me!” and “I use it to draw connections between articles I write,” which is something I do without AI using my fucking brain. Boosterism is a kind of religion, interested in finding symbolic “proof” that things are getting “better” in some indeterminate way, and that anyone that chooses to believe otherwise is ignorant. I’ll give you an example. Thomas Ptacek’s “My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts” was catnip for boosters — a software engineer using technical terms like “interact with Git” and “MCP,” vague charts, and, of course, an extremely vague statement that says hallucinations aren’t a problem: Is it? Anyway, my favourite part of the blog is this: Nobody projects more than an AI booster. They thrive on the sense they’re oppressed and villainized after years of seemingly every outlet claiming they’re right regardless of whether there’s any proof. They sneer and jeer and cry constantly that people are not showing adequate amounts of awe when an AI lab says “we did something in private, we can’t share it with you, but it’s so cool,” and constantly act as if they’re victims as they spread outright misinformation, either through getting things wrong or never really caring enough to check. Also, none of the booster arguments actually survive a thorough response, as Nik Suresh proved with his hilarious and brutal takedown of Ptacek’s piece. There are, I believe, some people who truly do love using LLMs, yet they are not the ones defending them. Ptacek’s piece drips with condescension, to the point that it feels like he’s trying to convince himself how good LLMs are, and because boosters are eternal victims, he wrote them a piece that they could send around to skeptics and say “heh, see?” without being able to explain why it was such a brutal takedown, mostly because they can’t express why other than “well this guy gets it!” One cannot be the big, smart genius that understands the glory and power of AI while also acting like a scared little puppy every time somebody tells them it sucks. In fact, that’s a great place to start. When you speak to an AI booster, you may get the instinct to shake them vigorously, or respond to their post by saying to do something with your something, or that they’re “stupid.” I understand the temptation, but you want to keep a head on a swivel — they thrive on victimisation. I’m sorry if you are an AI booster and this makes you feel bad. Please reflect on your work and how many times you’ve referred to somebody who didn’t understand AI in a manner that suggested they were ignorant, or tried to gaslight them by saying “AI was powerful” while providing no actionable ways in which it is. You cannot — and should not! — allow these people to act as if they are being victimized or “othered.” First and foremost: there are boosters at pretty much every major think tank, government agency and media outlet. It’s extremely lucrative being a booster. You’re showered with panel invites, access to executives, and are able to get headlines by saying how scared you are of the computer with ease. Being a booster is the easy path! Being a critic requires you to constantly have to explain yourself in a way that boosters never have to. If a booster says this to you, ask them to explain: There is no answer here, because this is not a coherent point of view. Boosters are more successful, get more perks and are in general better-treated than any critic. Fundamentally, these people exist in the land of the vague. They will drag you toward what's just on the horizon, but never quite define what the thing that dazzles you will be, or when it will arrive. Really, their argument comes down to one thought: you must get on board now, because at some point it'll be so good you'll feel stupid for not believing something that kind of sucks wouldn't be really good. If this line sounds familiar, it’s because you’ve heard it a million times before, most notably with crypto. They will make you define what would impress you, which isn't your job, in the same way finding a use case for them isn't your job. In fact, you are the customer! Here’s a great place to start: say “that’s a really weird thing to say!” It is peculiar to suggest that somebody doesn’t get how to use a product, and that we, as the customer, must justify ourselves to our own purchases. Make them justify their attitude. Just like any product, we buy software to serve a need. This is meant to be artificial *intelligence* — why is it so fucking stupid that I have to work out why it's useful? The answer, of course, is that it has no intellect, is not intelligent, and Large Language Models are being pushed up a mountain by a cadre of people who are either easily impressed or invested — either emotionally or financially — in its success due to the company they keep or their intentions for the world. If a booster suggests you “just don’t get it,” ask them to explain: Their use cases will likely be that AI has replaced search for them, that they use it for brainstorming or journaling, proof-reading an article, or looking through a big pile of their notes (or some other corpus of information) and summarizing it or pulling out insights. If a booster refers to AI “being powerful” and getting “more powerful,” ask them: The core of the AI booster’s argument is to make you feel bad. They will suggest you are intentionally not liking A.I. because you're a hater, or a cynic, or a Luddite. They will suggest that you are ignorant for not being amazed by ChatGPT. To be clear, anyone with a compelling argument doesn’t have to make you feel bad to convince you. The iPhone - and to be clear, I am referring to the concept of the smartphone and its utility, I am aware that there was marketing for the iPhone - didn’t need a fucking marketing campaign to explain why one device that can do a bunch of things you already find useful was good. You don't have to be impressed by ANYTHING by default, and any product — especially software — designed to make you feel stupid for "not getting it" is poorly designed. ChatGPT is the ultimate form of Silicon Valley Sociopathy — you must do the work to find the use cases, and thank them for being given the chance to do so. A.I. is not even good, reliable software! It resembles the death of the art of technology — inconsistent and unreliable by definition, inefficient by design, financially ruinous, and ADDS to the cognitive load of the user by requiring them to be ever-vigilant. So, here’s a really easy way to deal with this: if a booster ever suggests you are stupid or ignorant, ask them why it’s necessary to demean you to get their point across! Even if you are unable to argue on a technical level, make them explain why the software itself can’t convince you. Boosters will do everything they can to pull you off course. If you say that none of these companies make money, they’ll say it’s the early days. If you say AI companies burn billions, they’ll say the cost of inference is coming down. If you say the industry is massively overbuilding, they’ll say that this is actually just like the dot com boom and that the infrastructure will be picked up and used in the future. If you say there are no real use cases, they’ll say that ChatGPT has 700 million weekly users. Every time there’s the same god damn arguments, so I’ve sat down and written as many of them as I can think of. Print this and feed it to your local booster today. Anytime a booster says “AI will,” tell them to stop and explain what AI can do, and if they insist, ask them both when to expect the things they’re talking about, and if they say “very soon,” ask them to be more specific. Get them to agree to a date, then call them on that date. There’s that “will” bullshit again. Agents don’t work! They don’t work at all. The term “agent” means, to quote Max Woolf, “a workflow where the LLM can make its own decisions, [such as in the case of] web search [where] the LLM is told “you can search the web if you need to” then can output “I should search the web” and do so.” Yet “agent” has now become a mythical creature that means “totally autonomous AI that can do an entire job.” if anyone tells you “agents are…” you should ask them to point to one. If they say “coding,” please demand that they explain how autonomous these things are, and if they say that they can “refactor entire codebases,” ask them what that means, and also laugh at them. Here’s a comprehensive rundown, but here’s a particularly important part: Long story short, agents are not autonomous, they do not replace jobs, they cannot “replace coders,” they are not going to do so because probabilistic models are a horrible means of taking precise actions, and almost anyone who brings up agents as a booster is either misinformed or in the business of misinformation. Let's start with a really simple question: what does this actually mean? In many cases, I think they're referring to AI as being "like the early days of the internet." "The early days of the internet" can refer to just about anything. Are we talking about dial-up? DSL? Are we talking about the pre-platform days when people accessed it via Compuserve or AOL? Yes, yes, I remember that article from Newsweek, I already explained it here: In any case, one guy saying that the internet won't be big doesn't mean a fucking thing about generative AI and you are a simpleton if you think it does. One guy being wrong in some way is not a response to my work. I will crush you like a bug. If your argument is that the early internet required expensive Sun Microsystems servers to run, Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs addressed that by saying that the costs "pale in comparison," adding that we also didn't need to expand our power grid to build the early Web. This is a straight-up lie. Sorry! Also, as Jim Covello noted, there were hundreds of presentations in the early 2000s that included roadmaps that accurately fit how smartphones rolled out, and that no such roadmap exists for generative AI. The iPhone was also an immediate success as a thing that people paid for, with Apple selling four million units in the space of six months. Hell, in 2006 (the year before the iPhone launch), there was an estimated 17.7 million worldwide smartphone shipments (mostly from BlackBerry and other companies building on Windows Mobile, with Palm vacuuming up the crumbs), though to be generous to the generative AI boosters, I’ll disregard those. The original Attention Is All You Need paper — the one that kicked off the transformer-based Large Language Model era — was published in June 2017. ChatGPT launched in November 2022. Nevertheless, if we're saying "early days" here, we should actually define what that means. As I mentioned above, people paid for the iPhone immediately, despite it being a device that was completely and utterly new. While there was a small group of consumers that might have used similar devices (like the iPAQ), this was a completely new kind of computing, sold at a premium, requiring you to have a contract with a specific carrier (Cingular, now known as AT&T). Conversely, ChatGPT's "annualized" revenue in December 2023 was $1.6 billion (or $133 million a month), for a product that had, by that time, raised over $10 billion, and while we don't know what OpenAI lost in 2023, reports suggest it burned over $5 billion in 2024. Big tech has spent over $500 billion in capital expenditures in the last 18 months, and all told — between investments of cloud credits and infrastructure — will likely sink over $600 billion by year's-end. The "early days" of the internet were defined not by its lack of investment or attention, but by its obscurity. Even in 2000 — around the time of the dot-com bubble — only 52% of US adults used the internet, and it would take another 19 years for 90% of US adults to do so. These early days were also defined by its early functionality. The internet would become so much more because of the things that hyper-connectivity allowed us to do, and both faster internet connections and the ability to host software in the cloud would change, well, everything. We could define what “better” would mean, and make reasonable predictions about what people could do on a “better” internet. Yet even in those early days, it was obvious why you were using the internet, and how it might grow from there. One did not have to struggle to explain why buying a book online might be useful, or why a website might be a quicker reference than having to go to a library, or why downloading a game or a song might be a good idea. While habits might have needed adjusting, it was blatantly obvious what the value of the early internet was. It's also unclear when the early days of the internet ended. Only 44% of US adults had access to broadband internet by 2006. Were those the early days of the internet? The answer is "no," and that this point is brought up by people with a poor grasp of history and a flimsy attachment to reality. The early days of the internet were very, very different to any associated tech boom since, and we need to stop making the comparison. The internet also grew in a vastly different information ecosystem. Generative AI has had the benefit of mass media — driven by the internet! — along with social media (and social pressure) to "adopt AI" for multiple years. According to Pew, as of mid-June 2025, 34% of US adults have used ChatGPT, with 79% saying they had "heard at least a little about it." Furthermore, ChatGPT has always had a free version. On top of that, a study from May 2023 found that over 10,900 news headlines mentioned ChatGPT between November, 2022 and March, 2023, and a BrandWatch report found that in the first five months of its release, ChatGPT received over 9.24 million mentions on social media. Nearly 80% of people have heard of ChatGPT, and over a quarter of Americans have used it. If we're defining "the early days" based on consumer exposure, that ship has sailed. If we're defining "the early days" by the passage of time, it's been 8 years since Attention Is All You Need, and three since ChatGPT came out. While three years might not seem like a lot of time, the whole foundation of an "early days" argument is that in the early days, things do not receive the venture funding, research, attention, infrastructural support or business interest necessary to make them "big." In 2024, nearly 33% of all global venture funding went to artificial intelligence, and according to The Information, AI startups have raised over $40 billion in 2025 alone, with Statista adding that AI absorbed 71% of VC funding in Q1 2025. These numbers also fail to account for the massive infrastructure that companies like OpenAI and Anthropic don't have to pay for. The limitations of the early internet were two-fold: In generative AI's case, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have built out the "fiber optic cables" for Large Language Models. OpenAI and Anthropic have everything they need. They have (even if they say otherwise) plenty of compute, access to the literal greatest minds in the field, the constant attention of the media and global governments, and effectively no regulations or restrictions stopping them from training their models on the works of millions of people, or destroying our environment. They have already had this support. OpenAI was allowed to burn half a billion dollars on a training run for GPT-4.5 and 5. If anything, the massive amounts of capital have allowed us to massively condense the time in which a bubble goes from "possible" to "bursting and washing out a bunch of people," because the tech industry has such a powerful follower culture that only one or two unique ideas can exist at one time. The "early days" argument hinges on obscurity and limited resources, something that generative AI does not get to whine about. Companies that make effectively no revenue can raise $500 million to do the same AI coding bullshit that everybody else does. In simpler terms, these companies are flush with cash, have all the attention and investment they could possibly need, and are still unable to create a product with a defined, meaningful, mass-market use case. In fact, I believe that thanks to effectively infinite resources, we've speed-run the entire Large Language Model era, and we're nearing the end. These companies got what they wanted. Bonus trick: ask them to tell you what “the fiber boom” was. So, a little history. The "fiber boom" began after the telecommunications act of 1996 deregulated large parts of America's communications infrastructure, creating a massive boom — a $500 billion one to be precise, primarily funded with debt: In one sense, explaining what happened to the telecom sector is very simple: the growth in capacity has vastly outstripped the growth in demand. In the five years since the 1996 bill became law, telecommunications companies poured more than $500 billion into laying fiber optic cable, adding new switches, and building wireless networks. So much long-distance capacity was added in North America, for example, that no more than two percent is currently being used. With the fixed costs of these new networks so high and the marginal costs of sending signals over them so low, it is not a surprise that competition has forced prices down to the point where many firms have lost the ability to service their debts. No wonder we have seen so many bankruptcies and layoffs. This piece, written in 2002, is often cited as a defense against the horrifying capex associated with generative AI, as that fiber optic cable has been useful for delivering high-speed internet. Useful, right? This period was also defined by a gluttony of over-investment, ridiculous valuations and outright fraud. In any case, this is not remotely the same thing and anyone making this point needs to learn the very fucking basics of technology. GPUs are built to shove massive amounts of compute into one specific function again and again, like generating the output of a model (which, remember, mostly boils down to complex maths). Unlike CPUs, a GPU can't easily change tasks, or handle many little distinct operations, meaning that these things aren't going to be adopted for another mass-scale use case. In simpler terms, this was not an infrastructure buildout. The GPU boom is a heavily-centralized, capital expenditure-funded asset bubble where a bunch of chips will sit in warehouses waiting for somebody to make up a use case for them, and if an endearing one existed, we'd already have it because we already have all the fucking GPUs. You are describing fan fiction. AI 2027 is fan fiction. Anyone who believes in it is a mark! It doesn’t matter if all of the people writing the fan fiction are scientists, or that they all have “the right credentials.” They themselves say that AI 2027 is a “guess,” an “extrapolation” (guess) with “expert feedback” (someone editing your fan fiction), and involves “experience at OpenAI” (there are people that worked on the shows they write fan fiction about). I am not going to go line-by-line to cut this apart anymore than I am going to write a lengthy takedown of someone’s erotic Banjo Kazooie story, because both are fictional. The entire premise of this nonsense is that at one point someone invents a self-learning “agent” that teaches itself stuff, and it does a bunch of other stuff as a result, with different agents with different numbers after them. There is no proof this is possible, nobody has done it, nobody will do it. AI 2027 was written specifically to fool people that wanted to be fooled, with big charts and the right technical terms used to lull the credulous into a wet dream and New York Times column where one of the writers folds their hands and looks worried. It was also written to scare people that are already scared. It makes big, scary proclamations, with tons of links to stuff that looks really legitimate but, when you piece it all together, is still fan fiction. My personal favourite part is “Mid 2026: China Wakes Up,” which involves China’s intelligence agencies trying to steal OpenBrain’s agent (no idea who this company could be referring to, I’m stumped!), before the headline of “AI Takes Some Jobs” after OpenBrain released a model oh god I am so bored even writing up this tripe! Sarah Lyons put it well, arguing that AI 2027 (and AI in general) is no different from the spurious “spectral evidence” used to accuse someone of being a witch during the Salem Witch Trials: Anyway, AI 2027 is fan fiction, nothing more, and just because it’s full of fancy words and has five different grifters on its byline doesn’t mean anything. Bonus trick: Ask them to explain whether things have actually got cheaper, and if they say they have, ask them why there are no profitable AI companies. If they say “they’re currently in growth stage,” ask them why there are no profitable AI companies. At this point they should try and kill you. In an interview on a podcast from earlier in the year, journalist Casey Newton said the following about my work: Newton then says — several octaves higher, showing how mad he isn't — that "[he] thought what [he] said was very civil" and that there are "things that are true and there are things that are false, like you can choose which ones you wanna believe." I am not going to be so civil. Other than the fact that Casey refers to "micro-innovations" (?) and "DeepSeek being on a curve that was expected," he makes — as many do — two very big mistakes, ones that I personally would not have said in a sentence that begun with suggesting that I knew how the technology works. Inference — and I've gotten this one wrong in the past too! — is everything that happens from when you put a prompt in to generate an output. It's when an AI, based on your prompt, "infers" meaning. To be more specific, and quoting Google, "...machine learning inference is the process of running data points into a machine learning model to calculate an output such as a single numerical score." Casey will try and weasel out of this one and say this is what he meant. It wasn't. Casey, like many people who talk about stuff without learning about it first, is likely referring to the fact that the price of tokens for some models has gone down in some cases. The problem, however, is that these are raw token costs, not actual expressions or evaluations of token burn in a practical setting. Worse still… Well, the cost of inference actually went up. In an excellent blog for Kilocode, Ewa Szyszka explained: Token consumption per application grew a lot because models allowed for longer context windows and bigger suggestions from the models. The combination of a steady price per token and more token consumption caused app inference costs to grow about 10x over the last two years. To explain in really simple terms, while the costs of old models may have decreased, new models cost about the same, and the "reasoning" that these models do actually burn way, way more tokens. When these new models "reason," they break a user's input and break into component parts, then run inference on each one of those parts. When you plug an LLM into an AI coding environment, it will naturally burn an absolute ton of tokens, in part because of the large amount of information you have to load into the prompt (and the "context window," or the information you load in with your prompt, with token burn increasing with the size of that information), and in part because generating code is inference-intensive. In fact, the inference costs are so severe that Szyszka says that "...combination of a steady price per token and more token consumption caused app inference costs to grow about 10x over the last two years." I refuse to let this point go, because people love to say "the cost of inference is going down" when the cost of inference has increased, and they do so to a national audience, all while suggesting I am wrong somehow. I am not wrong. In fact, software development influencer Theo Browne recently put out a video called "I was wrong about AI costs (they keep going up)," which he breaks down as follows: The price drops have, for the most part, stopped. See the below chart from The Information: You cannot, at this point, fairly evaluate whether a model is "cheaper" just based on its cost-per-tokens, because reasoning models are inherently built to use more tokens to create an output. Reasoning models are also the only way that model developers have been able to improve the efficacy of new models, using something called "test-time compute" to burn extra tokens to complete a task. And in basically anything you're using today, there's gonna be some sort of reasoning model, especially if you're coding. The cost of inference has gone up. Statements otherwise are purely false, and are the opinion of somebody who does not know what he's talking about. ...maybe? It sure isn't trending that way, nor has it gone down yet. I also predict that there's going to be a sudden realization in the media that it's going up, which has kind of already started. The Information had a piece recently about it, where they note that Intuit paid $20 million to Azure last year (primarily for access to OpenAI's models), and is on track to spend $30 million this year, which "outpaces the company's revenue growth in the same period, raising questions about how sustainable the spending is and how much of the cost it can pass along to customers." The problem here is that the architecture underlying Large Language Models is inherently unreliable. I imagine OpenAI's introduction of the router to ChatGPT-5 is an attempt to moderate both the costs of the model chosen and reduce the amount of exposure to reasoning models for simple queries — though Altman was boasting on August 10th about the "significant increase" in both free and paid users' exposure to reasoning models. Worse still, a study written up by VentureBeat found that open-weight models burn between 1.5 to 4 times more tokens, in part due to a lack of token efficiency, and in particular thanks to — you guessed it! — reasoning models: The findings challenge a prevailing assumption in the AI industry that open-source models offer clear economic advantages over proprietary alternatives. While open-source models typically cost less per token to run, the study suggests this advantage can be “easily offset if they require more tokens to reason about a given problem.” And models keep getting bigger and more expensive, too. Because model developers hit a wall of diminishing returns, and the only way to make their models do more was to make them burn more tokens to generate a more accurate response (this is a very simple way of describing reasoning, a thing that OpenAI launched in September 2024 and others followed). As a result, all the "gains" from "powerful new models" come from burning more and more tokens. The cost-per-million-token number is no longer an accurate measure of the actual costs of generative AI, because it's much, much harder to tell how many tokens a reasoning model may burn, and it varies (as Theo Browne noted) from model to model. In any case, there really is no changing this path. They are out of ideas. So, I've heard this argument maybe 50 times in the last year, to the point that I had to talk about it in my July 2024 piece "How Does OpenAI Survive." Nevertheless, people make a few points about Uber and AI that I think are fundamentally incorrect, and I'll break them down for you. I've seen this argument a lot, and it's one that's both ahistorical and alarmingly ignorant of the very basics of society. So, OpenAI got a $200 million defense contract with an "estimated completion date of July 2026," and is selling ChatGPT Enterprise to the US government for a dollar a year (along with Anthropic, which sells access to Claude for the same price, Even Google is undercutting them, selling Gemini access at 47 cents for a year). You're probably reading that and saying "oh no, that means the government has paid them now, they're never going away," and I cannot be clear enough that you believing this is the intention of these deals. These are built specifically to make you feel like these things are never going away. This is also an attempt to get "in" with the government at a rate that makes "trying" these models a no-brainer. ...and??????? "The government is going to have cheap access to AI software" does not mean that "the government relies on AI software." Every member of the government having access to ChatGPT — something that is not even necessarily the case! — does not make this software useful, let alone essential, and if OpenAI burns a bunch of money "making it work for them," it still won't be essential, because Large Language Models are not actually that useful for doing stuff! Uber used lobbyist Bradley Tusk to steamroll local governments into allowing Uber to operate in their cities, but Tusk did not have to convince local governments that Uber was useful or have to train people how to use it. Uber's "too big to fail" moment was that local cabs kind of fucking sucked just about everywhere. Did you ever try and take a yellow cab from Downtown Manhattan to Hoboken New Jersey? Or Brooklyn? Or Queens? Did you ever try to pay with a credit card? How about trying to get a cab outside of a major metropolitan area? Do you remember how bad that was? I am not glorifying Uber the company, but the experience that Uber replaced was very, very bad. As a result, Uber did become too big to fail, because people now rely upon it because the old system sucked. Uber used its masses of venture capital to keep prices low to get people used to it too, but the fundamental experience was better than calling a cab company and hoping that they showed up. I also want to be clear this is not me condoning Uber, take public transport if you can! To be clear, Uber has created a new kind of horrifying, extractive labor practice which deprives people of benefits and dignity, paying off academics to help the media gloss over the horrors of its platform. It is also now having to increase prices. What, exactly, is the "essential" experience of generative AI? What essential experience are we going to miss if ChatGPT disappears tomorrow? And on an enterprise or governmental level: what exactly are these tools doing for governments that would make removing them so painful? What use cases? What outcomes? Uber's "essential" nature is that millions of people use it in place of regular taxis, and it effectively replaced decrepit, exploitative systems like the yellow cab medallions in New York with its own tech-enabled exploitation system that, nevertheless, worked far better for the user. Sidenote: although I acknowledge that the disruption that Uber brought to the medallion system had horrendous consequences for the owners of said medallions — some of whom had paid more than a million dollars for the privilege to drive a New York taxi cab, and were burdened under mountains of debt. There is no such use case with ChatGPT, or any other generative AI system. You cannot point to one use case that is anywhere near as necessary as cabs in cities, and indeed the biggest use cases — things like brainstorming and search — are either easily replaced by any other commoditized LLM or literally already exist with Google Search. Nope! Sorry, this is a really simple one. These data centers are not, in and of themselves, driving much economic growth other than in the costs of building them. As I've discussed again and again, there's maybe $40 billion in revenue and no profit coming out of these companies. There isn't any economic growth! They're not holding up anything! These data centers, once built, also create very little economic activity. They don't create jobs, they take up massive amounts of land and utilities, and they piss off and poison their neighbors. If anything, letting these things die would be a political win. There is no "great loss" associated with the death of the Large Language Model era. Taking away Uber would genuinely affect people's ability to get places. So, the classic (and wrong!) argument about OpenAI and companies like OpenAI is that "Uber burned a bunch of money and is now "cash-flow positive" or "profitable." Let's talk about raw losses, and where people are making this assumption. Uber lost $24.9 billion in the space of four years (2019 to 2022), in part because of the billions it was spending on sales and marketing and R&D — $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion respectively in 2019 alone. It also massively subsidized the cost of rides — which is why prices had to increase — and spent heavily on driver recruitment, burning cash to get scale, the classic Silicon Valley way. This is absolutely nothing like how Large Language Models are growing, and I am tired of defending this point. OpenAI and Anthropic burn money primarily through compute costs and specialized talent. These costs are increasing, especially with the rush to hire every single AI scientist at the most expensive price possible. There are also essential, immovable costs that neither OpenAI nor Anthropic have to shoulder — the construction of the data centers necessary to train and run inference for their models, which I will get to in a little bit. Yes, Uber raised $33.5 billion (through multiple rounds of post-IPO debt, though it raised about $25 billion in actual funding). Yes, Uber burned an absolute ass-ton of money. Yes, Uber has scale. But Uber was not burning money as a means of making its product functional or useful. Furthermore, the costs associated with Uber — and its capital expenditures from 2019 through 2024 were around $2.2 billion! — are miniscule compared to the actual costs of OpenAI and Anthropic. Both OpenAI and Anthropic lost around $5 billion in 2024, but their infrastructure was entirely paid for by either Microsoft, Google or Amazon. While we don't know how much of this infrastructure is specifically for OpenAI or Anthropic, as the largest model developers it's fair to assume that a large chunk — at least 30% — of Amazon and Microsoft's capital expenditures have been to support these loads (I leave out Google as it's unclear whether it’s expanded its infrastructure for Anthropic, but we know Amazon has done so). As a result, the true "cost" of OpenAI and Anthropic is at least ten times what Uber burned. Amazon spent $83 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and expects to spend $105 billion in 2025. Microsoft spent $55.6 billion in 2024 and expects to spend $80 billion this year. Based on my (conservative) calculations, the true "cost" of OpenAI is around $82 billion, and that only includes capex from 2024 onward, based on 30% of Microsoft's capex (as not everything has been invested yet in 2025, and OpenAI is not necessarily all of the capex) and the $41.4 billion of funding it’s received so far. The true cost of Anthropic is around $77.1 billion, including all its funding and 30% of Amazon's capex from the beginning of 2024. These are inexact comparisons, but the classic argument is that Uber "burned lots of money and worked out okay," when in fact the combined capital expenditures from 2024 onwards that are necessary to make Anthropic and OpenAI work are each — on their own — four times the amount Uber burned in over a decade. I also believe that these numbers are conservative. There's a good chance that Anthropic and OpenAI dominate the capex of Amazon and Microsoft, in part because what the fuck else are they buying all these GPUs for, as their own AI services don't seem to be making that much money at all. Anyway, to put it real simple, AI has burned more in the last two years than Uber burned in ten, Uber didn't burn money in the same way, didn't burn much by way of capital expenditures, didn't require massive amounts of infrastructure, and isn't remotely the same in any way, shape or form, other than it burned a lot of money — and that burning wasn’t because it was trying to build the core product, but rather trying to scale. I covered this in depth in the Hater's Guide To The AI Bubble, but the long and short of it is that AWS is a platform, a necessity with an obvious choice, and has burned about ten percent of what Amazon et. al has burned chasing generative AI, and had proven demand before building it. Also, AWS was break-even in three years. OpenAI was founded in fucking 2015, and even if you start from November 2022, by AWS standards it should be break-even! Amazon Web Services was created out of necessity — Amazon's infrastructure needs were so great that it effectively had to build both the software and hardware necessary to deliver a store that sold theoretically everything to theoretically anywhere, handling both the traffic from customers, delivering the software that runs Amazon.com quickly and reliably, and, well, making sure things ran in a stable way. It didn't need to come up with a reason for people to run web applications — they were already doing so themselves, but in ways that cost a lot, were inflexible, and required specialist skills. AWS took something that people already did, and what there was a proven demand for, and made it better. Eventually, Google and Microsoft would join the fray. As I’ve discussed in the past, this metric is basically “monthx12,” and while it’s a fine measure for high-gross-margin businesses like SaaS companies, it isn’t for AI. It doesn’t account for churn (when people leave). It also is a number intentionally used to make a company sound more successful — so you can say “$200 million annualized revenue” instead of “$16.6 million a month.” Also, if they’re saying this number, it’s likely that number isn’t consistent! Also: Simple answer: why have literally none of them done this yet? Why not one? Why? There’s that “will” bullshit, once again, always about the “will.” We do not know how thinking works in humans and thus cannot extrapolate it to a machine, and at the very least human beings have the ability to re-evaluate things and learn, a thing that LLMs cannot do and will never do. We do not know how to get to AGI. Sam Altman said in June that OpenAI was “now confident [they knew] how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.” In August, Altman said that AGI was “not a super useful term,” and that “the point of all this is it doesn’t really matter and it’s just this continuing exponential of model capability that we’ll rely on for more and more things.” So, yeah, total bullshit. Even Meta’s Chief AI Scientist says it isn’t possible with transformer-based models. We don’t know if AGI is possible, anyone claiming they do is lying. This, too, is hogwash, nothing different than your buddy’s friend’s uncle who works at Nintendo that says Mario is coming to PlayStation. Ilya Sutskever and Mira Murati raised billions for companies with no product, let alone a product road map, and they did so because they saw a good opportunity for a grift and to throw a bunch of money at compute. Also: if someone from “deep within the AI industry” has told somebody “big things are coming,” they are doing so to con them or make them think they have privileged information. Ask for specifics. This argument is poised as a comeback to my suggestion that AI isn't particularly useful, a proof point that this movement is not inherently wasteful, or that there are, in fact, use cases for ChatGPT that are lasting, meaningful or important. I disagree. In fact, I believe ChatGPT — and LLMs in general — have been marketed based on lies of inference. Ironic, I know. I also have grander concerns and suspicions about what OpenAI considers a “user” and how it counts revenue, I’ll get into that later in the week on my premium newsletter, which you should subscribe to. Here’s a hint though: 500,000 of OpenAI’s “5 million business customers” are from its $15 million deal with Cal State University, which works out to around $2.50-a-user-a-month. It’s also started doing $1-a-month trials of its $30-a-month “Teams” subscription, and one has to wonder how many of those are counted in that total, and for how long. I do not know the scale of these offers, nor how long OpenAI has been offering them. A Redditor posted about the deal a few months ago, saying that OpenAI was offering up to 5 seats at once. In fact, I've found a few people talking about these deals, and even one adding that they were offered an annual $10-a-month ChatGPT Plus subscription, with one person saying a few weeks ago saying they'd seen people offered this deal for canceling their subscription. Suspicious. But there’s a greater problem at play. So, ChatGPT has 700 million weekly active users. OpenAI has yet to provide a definition — and yes, I've asked! — which means that an "active" user could be defined as somebody who has gone to ChatGPT once in the space of a week. This term is extremely flimsy, and doesn't really tell us much. Similarweb says that in July 2025 ChatGPT.com had 1.287 billion total visits, making it a very popular website. What do these facts actually mean, though? As I said previously, ChatGPT has had probably the most sustained PR campaign for anything outside of a presidency or a pop star. Every single article about AI mentions OpenAI or ChatGPT, every single feature launch — no matter how small — gets a slew of coverage. Every single time you hear "AI" you’re made to think of "ChatGPT” by a tech media that has never stopped to think about their role in hype, or their responsibility to their readers. And as this hype has grown, the publicity compounds, because the natural thing for a journalist to do when everybody is talking about something is to talk about it more. ChatGPT's immediate popularity may have been viral, but the media took the ball and ran with it, and then proceeded to tell people it did stuff it did not. People were pressured to try this service then under false pretenses, something that continues to this day. I'll give you an example. On March 15 2023, Kevin Roose of the New York Times would say that OpenAI's GPT-4 was "exciting and scary," exacerbating (his words!) "...the dizzy and vertiginous feeling I’ve been getting whenever I think about A.I. lately," wondering if he was experiencing "future shock," then described how it was an indeterminate level of "better" and something that immediately sounded ridiculous: In one test, conducted by an A.I. safety research group that hooked GPT-4 up to a number of other systems, GPT-4 was able to hire a human TaskRabbit worker to do a simple online task for it — solving a Captcha test — without alerting the person to the fact that it was a robot. The A.I. even lied to the worker about why it needed the Captcha done, concocting a story about a vision impairment. That doesn't sound remotely real! I went and looked up the paper, and here is the entire extent of what OpenAI shared: This safety card led to the perpetration of one of the earliest falsehoods — and most eagerly-parotted lies — that ChatGPT and generative AI is capable of "agentic" actions. Outlet after outlet — led by Kevin Roose — eagerly interpreted an entire series of events that took place that doesn't remotely make sense, starting with the fact that this is not something you can hire a Taskrabbit to do. Or, at the very least, without a contrived situation where you create an empty task and ask them to complete it. Why not use Mechanical Turk? Or Fiverr? They’ve tons of people offering this service! But I'm a curious little critter, so I went further and followed their citation to a link on METR's research page. It turns out that what actually happened was METR had a researcher copy paste the generated responses from the model and otherwise handle the entire interaction with Taskrabbit, and based on the plurality of "Taskrabbit contractors," it appears to have taken multiple tries. On top of that, it appears that OpenAI/METR were prompting the model on what to say, which kind of defeats the point. Emphases mine, and comments in [brackets]: It took me five whole minutes to find this piece — which is cited on the GPT-4 system card — read it, then write this piece. It did not require any technical knowledge other than the ability to read stuff. It is transparently, blatantly obvious that GPT-4 did not "hire" a Taskrabbit or, indeed, make any of these actions — it was prompted to, and they do not show the prompts they used, likely because they had to use so many of them. Anyone falling for this is a mark, and OpenAI should have gone out of its way to correct people. Instead, they sat back and let people publish outright misinformation. Roose, along with his co-host Casey Newton, would go on to describe this example at length on a podcast that week, describing an entire narrative where “the human actually gets suspicious” and “GPT 4 reasons out loud that it should not reveal that [it is] a robot,” at which point “the TaskRabbit solves the CAPTCHA.” During this conversation, Newton gasps and says “oh my god” twice, and when he asks Roose “how does the model understand that in order to succeed at this task, it has to deceive the human?” Roose responds “we don’t know, that is the unsatisfying answer,” and Newton laughs and states “we need to pull the plug. I mean, again, what?” Credulousness aside, the GPT-4 marketing campaign was incredibly effective, creating an aura that allowed OpenAI to take advantage of the vagueness of its offering as people — including members of the media — willfully filled in the blanks for them. Altman has never had to work to sell this product. Think about it — have you ever heard OpenAI tell you what ChatGPT can do, or gone to great lengths to describe its actual abilities? Even on OpenAI's own page for ChatGPT, the text is extremely vague: Scrolling down, you're told ChatGPT can "write, brainstorm, edit and explore ideas with you." It can "generate and debug code, automate repetitive tasks, and [help you] learn new APIs." With ChatGPT you can "learn something new...dive into a hobby...answer complex questions" and "analyze data and create charts." What repetitive tasks? Who knows. How am I learning? Unclear. It's got thinking built in! What that means is unclear, unexplained, and thus allows a user to incorrectly believe that ChatGPT has a brain. To be clear, I know what reasoning means, but this website does not attempt to explain what "thinking" means. You can also "offload complex tasks from start to finish with an agent," which can, according to OpenAI, "think and act, proactively choosing from a toolbox of agentic skills to complete tasks for you using its own computer." This is an egregious lie, employing the kind of weasel-wording that would be used to torture "I.R. Baboon" for an eternity. Precise in its vagueness, OpenAI's copy is honed to make reporters willing to simply write down whatever they see and interpret it in the most positive light. And thus the lie of inference began. What "ChatGPT" meant was muddied from the very beginning, and thus ChatGPT's actual outcomes have never been fully defined. What ChatGPT "could do" became a form of folklore — a non-specific form of "automation" that could "write code" and "generate copy and images," that can "analyze data," all things that are true but one can infer much greater meaning from. One can infer that "automation" means the automation of anything related to text, or that "write code" means "write the entirety of a computer program." OpenAI's ChatGPT agent is not, by any extension of the word, "already a powerful tool for handling complex tasks," but it has not, in any meaningful sense, committed to any actual outcomes. As a result, potential users — subject to a 24/7 marketing campaign — have been pushed toward a website that can theoretically do anything or nothing, and have otherwise been left to their own devices. The endless gaslighting, societal pressure, media pressure, and pressure from their bosses has pushed hundreds of millions of people to try a product that even its creators can't really describe. As I've said in the past, OpenAI is deliberately using Weekly Active Users so that it doesn't have to publish its monthly active users, which I believe would be higher. Why wouldn't it do this? Well, OpenAI has 20 million paying ChatGPT subscribers and five million "business customers," with no explanation of what the difference might be. This is already a mediocre (3.5%) conversion rate, yet its monthly active users (which are likely either 800 million or 900 million, but these are guesses!) would make that rate lower than 3%, which is pretty terrible considering everybody says this shit is the future. I also am tired of having people claim that "search" or "brainstorm" or "companions" are a lasting, meaningful business models. So, OpenAI announced that it has hit its first $1 billion month on August 20, 2025 on CNBC, which brings it exactly in line with my estimated $5.26 billion in revenue that I believe it has made as of the end of July. However, remember what the MIT study said: enterprise adoption is high but transformation is low. There are tons of companies throwing money at AI, but they are not seeing actual returns. OpenAI's growth as the single-most-prominent company in AI (and if we're honest, one of the most prominent in software writ large) makes sense, but at some point will slow, because the actual returns for the businesses aren't there. If there were, we'd have one article where we could point at a ChatGPT integration that at scale helped a company make or save a bunch of money, written in plain English and not a gobbledygook of "profit improvement." Also… OpenAI is projected to make $12.7 billion in 2025. How exactly will it do that? Is it really making $1.5 billion a month by the end of the year? Even if it does, is the idea that it keeps burning $10 billion or more every year into eternity? What actual revenue potential does OpenAI have long-term? Its products are about as good as everyone else's, cost about the same, and do the same things. ChatGPT is basically the same product as Claude or Grok or any number of different LLMs. The only real advantages that OpenAI has are infrastructure and brand recognition. These models have clearly hit a wall where training is hitting diminishing returns, meaning that its infrastructural advantage is that they can continue providing its service at scale, nothing more. It isn't making its business cheaper, other than the fact that it mostly hasn’t had to pay for it...other than the site in Abilene Texas where it’s promised Oracle $30 billion a year by 2028. I'm sorry, I don't buy it! I don't buy that this company will continue growing forever, and its stinky conversion rate isn't going to change anytime soon. How? Literally…how! How? How! HOW??? Nobody ever answers this question! “Efficiencies”? If you’re going to say GPT-5 — here’s a scoop I have about how it’s less efficient! It's very, very, very common for people to conflate "AI" with "generative AI." Make sure that whatever you're claiming or being told is actually about Large Language Models, as there are all sorts of other kinds of machine learning that people love to bring up. LLMs have nothing to do with Folding@Home, autonomous cars, or most disease research. A lot of people think that they're going to tell me "I use this all the time!" and that'll change my mind. I cannot express enough how irrelevant it is that you have a use case, as every use case I hear is one of the following: This would all be fine and dandy if people weren't talking about this stuff as if it was changing society. None of these use cases come close to explaining why I should be impressed by generative AI. It also doesn't matter if you yourself have kind of a useful thing that AI did for you once. We are so past the point when any of that matters. AI is being sold as a transformational technology, and I am yet to see it transform anything. I am yet to hear one use case that truly impresses me, or even one thing that feels possible now that wasn't possible before. This isn't even me being a cynic — I'm ready to be impressed! I just haven't been in three fucking years and it's getting boring. Also, tell me with a straight face any of this shit is worth the infrastructure. One of the most braindead takes about AI and coding is that "vibe coding" is "allowing anyone to build software." While technically true, in that one can just type "build me a website" into one of many AI coding environments, this does not mean it is functional or useful software. Let's make this really clear: AI cannot "just handle coding." Read this excellent piece by Colton Voege, then read this piece by Nik Suresh. If you contact me about AI and coding without reading these I will send them to you and nothing else, or crush you like a car in a garbage dump, one or the other. Also, show me a vibe coded company. Not a company where someone who can code has quickly spun up some features, a fully-functional, secure, and useful app made entirely by someone who cannot code. You won't be able to find this as it isn't possible. Vibe Coding is a marketing term based on lies, peddled by people who have either a lack of knowledge or morals. Are AI coding environments making people faster? I don't think so! In fact, a recent study suggested they actually make software engineers slower. The reason that nobody is vibe coding an entire company is because software development is not just "put a bunch of code in a pile and hit "go," and oftentimes when you add something it breaks something else. This is all well and good if you actually understand code — it's another thing entirely when you are using Cursor or Claude Code like a kid at an arcade machine turning the wheel repeatedly and pretending they're playing the demo. Vibe coders are also awful for the already negative margins of most AI coding environments, as every single thing they ask the model to do is imprecise, burning tokens in pursuit of a goal they themselves don't understand. "Vibe coding" does not work, it will not work, and pretending otherwise is at best ignorance and at worst supporting a campaign built on lies. If you are an AI booster, please come up with better arguments. And if you truly believe in this stuff, you should have a firmer grasp on why you do so. It's been three years, and the best some of you have is "it's real popular!" or "Uber burned a lot of money!" Your arguments are based on what you wish were true rather than what's actually true, and it's deeply embarrassing. Then again, there are many well-intentioned people who aren't necessarily AI boosters who repeat these arguments, regardless of how thinly-framed they are, in part because we live in a high-information, low-processing society where people tend to put great faith in people who are confident in what they say and sound smart. I also think the media is failing on a very basic level to realize that their fear of missing out or seeming stupid is being used against them. If you don't understand something, it's likely because the person you're reading or hearing it from doesn't either. If a company makes a promise and you don't understand how they'd deliver on it, it's their job to explain how, and your job to suggest it isn't plausible in clear and defined language. This has gone beyond simple "objectivity" into the realm of an outright failure of journalism. I have never seen more misinformation about the capabilities of a product in my entire career, and it's largely peddled by reporters who either don't know or have no interest in knowing what's actually possible, in part because all of their peers are saying the same nonsense. As things begin to collapse — and they sure look like they're collapsing, but I am not making any wild claims about "the bubble bursting" quite yet — it will look increasingly more deranged to bluntly publish everything that these companies say. Never have I seen an act of outright contempt more egregious than Sam Altman saying that GPT-5 was actually bad, and that GPT-6 will be even better. Members of the media: Sam Altman does not respect you. He is not your friend. He is not secretly confiding in you. He thinks you are stupid and easily-manipulated, and will print anything he says, largely in part because many members of the media will print exactly what he says whenever he says it. To be clear, if you wrote about it and actively mocked it, that's fine. But let's close by discussing the very nature of AI skepticism, and the so-called "void" between those who "hate" AI and those who "love" AI, from the perspective of one of the more prominent people in the "skeptic" side. Critics and skeptics are not given the benefit of grace, patience, or, in many cases, hospitality when it comes to their position. While they may receive interviews and opportunities to "give their side," it is always framed as the work of a firebrand, an outlier, somebody with dangerous ideas that they must eternally justify. They are demonized, their points under constant scrutiny, their allegiances and intentions constantly interrogated for some sort of moral or intellectual weakness. "Skeptic" and "critic" are words said with a sneer or trepidation — that the listener should be suspicious that this person isn't agreeing that AI is the most powerful, special thing ever. To not immediately fall in love with something that everybody is talking about is to be framed as a "hater," to have oneself introduced with the words "not everybody agrees..." on 40% of appearances. By comparison, AI boosters are the first to get TV appearances and offers to be on panels, their coverage featured prominently on Techmeme, selling slop-like books called shit like The Future Of Intelligence: Masters Of The Brain featuring 18 interviews with different CEOs that all say the same thing. They do not have to justify their love — they simply have to remember all the right terms, chirping out "test-time compute" and "the cost of inference is going down" enough times to summon Wario Amodei to give them an hour-long interview where he says "the models, they are, in years, going to be the most powerful school teacher ever built." And yeah, I did sell a book, because my shit fucking rocks. I have consistent, deeply-sourced arguments that I've built on over the course of years. I didn't "become a hater" because I'm a "contrarian," I became a hater because the shit that these fucking oafs have done to the computer pisses me off. I wrote The Man Who Killed Google Search because I wanted to know why Google Search sucked. I wrote Sam Altman, Freed because at the time I didn't understand why everybody was so fucking enamoured with this damp sociopath. Everything I do comes from genuine curiosity and an overwhelming frustration with the state of technology. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers and 60 views, and have written it as an exploration of subjects that grows as I write. I do not have it in me to pretend to be anything other than what I am, and if that is strange to you, well, I'm a strange man, but at least I'm an honest one. I do have a chip on my shoulder, in that I really do not like it when people try to make other people feel stupid, especially when they do so as a means of making money for themselves or somebody else. I write this stuff out because I have an intellectual interest, I like writing, and by writing, I am able to learn about and process my complex feelings about technology. I happen to do so in a manner that hundreds of thousands of people enjoy every month, and if you think that I've grown this by "being a hater," you are doing yourself the disservice of underestimating me, which I will use to my advantage by writing deeper, more meaningful, more insightful things than you. I have watched these pigs ruin the computer again and again, and make billions doing so, all while the media celebrates the destruction of things like Google, Facebook, and the fucking environment in pursuit of eternal growth. I cannot manufacture my disgust, nor can I manufacture whatever it is inside me that makes it impossible to keep quiet about the things I see.

Title: Former lottery boss Dermot Griffin to lead pension auto-enrolment agency
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/08/27/employers-face-tight-turnaround-preparing-for-auto-enrolment/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
Former National Lottery chief executive Dermot Griffin has been picked to lead the agency responsible for the automatic enrolment (AE) pensions system, which is set to come into force in January. Mr Griffin, a chartered accountant, served as head of the National Lottery from 2005 to 2019 before becoming chief executive of the Credit Union Service Organisation for Payments. He is also a non-executive director of the Irish Aviation Authority. The board of the new National Automatic Enrolemnt Retirement Savings Authority (Naersa) will be chaired by Roma Burke, an experienced actuary with extensive knowledge of the pensions industry. Ms Burke has previously served as chairwoman of the Pensions Council and was a member of the Pensions Commission, leading its technical subcommittee. Naersa will administer the auto-enrolment (AE) scheme, called My Future Fund, which will capture about 800,000 workers in the State who are not in a workplace or private pension plan. “We received a very high level of interest in these positions from very strong candidates. This shows that MyFuture Fund, and its importance to the future of Ireland, has resonated with people, and gives me the luxury of selecting individuals from a range of backgrounds and with diverse and extensive experience,” said Minister for Social Protection Dara Calleary. The introduction of the AE system – known as My Future Fund, which Naersa will run – has been subject to several delays in recent years. The system is now set to start on January 1st. AE will apply to workers aged between 23 and 60 who earn at least €20,000 per year across one or more jobs and who are not already members of an occupational pension scheme. Employers and employees will each initially contribute 1.5 per cent of gross earnings to their pension pot, with the Government adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions are due to increase in stages, reaching 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in year 10. Under auto-enrolment, funds will be managed by three investment providers: Irish Life Investment Managers, Amundi and BlackRock. The AE scheme is expected to hold more than €20 billion of assets on behalf of beneficiaries within 10 years, rising potentially to more than €300 billion over 30-40 years, according to the Government. “It will be my goal to make sure that employers are supported through the introduction of MyFuture Fund by ensuring that Naersa performs all of its functions,” said Mr Griffin. “However, the other side of this is making sure Naersa protects employees, and compliance will be a key area of my focus. This is a hugely important moment for Ireland, and I feel a great deal of pride to be the person in charge of getting Naersa on its feet and ensuring MyFuture Fund is up and running.” AE was first proposed in 2006 by then minister for social affairs Séamus Brennan, but has been through years of false dawns. Enabling draft legislation, originally scheduled to be published before the Dáil’s summer recess in 2023, was finally signed into law in July last year. Indian information technology company Tata Consultancy Services was hired in 2024 to build and run the system.

Title: Bitcoin Sentiment On Binance Turns Bullish – But Is The Market Setting A Trap?

Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped more than 7%, falling from around $117,400 on August 21 to a low of $108,666 earlier today. Despite the bearish slide, some encouraging exchange data suggests improving sentiment. However, analysts warn this could once again be a setup for institutions to trap retail buyers. According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisD, the Binance vs. Other Exchanges BTC Volume Delta turned positive on August 25, registering $676 million. This indicates that Binance users have shifted decisively into spot buying mode. Notably, this trend has not been observed on other major exchanges. Since Binance is the world’s largest exchange in terms of liquidity and user base, its flows are often considered a reflection of broader market sentiment. At present, retail investors appear to be fueling buying pressure. While this can support demand for BTC, it also creates an opening for institutional investors to drive prices lower, flushing out retail positions before the market resumes an upward move. BorisD highlighted that historically, when Binance users increase spot buying, Bitcoin’s price often declines. On the contrary, when selling pressure rises, BTC tends to recover in price. He explained: This dynamic highlights the clear difference between retail and institutional behavior. Retail traders often act emotionally and position themselves on the wrong side, while institutions strategically engineer liquidity around these flows. In conclusion, the analyst said that although rising spot buying on Binance is encouraging, a positive delta does not always mean a bullish signal. On the contrary, it can expose retail buying pressure than can be exploited as an opportunity by institutions. Analysts remain divided on whether Bitcoin can set a new all-time high (ATH) in the near term. Some stress that BTC must hold above the $100,000 level to preserve its overall bullish structure. In a separate analysis, crypto analyst Alphractal remarked that the BTC market seems to be getting ready for its next major move in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Bull Score Index is giving signs of fading momentum, increasing risk of further downside. The Bitcoin market is also witnessing early signs of exhaustion, as asset manager BlackRock recently went on a BTC selling-spree, dumping about $500 million of the digital asset. Still, a number of analysts remain optimistic, with some forecasting a potential ATH of as high as $183,000 later this year. At press time, BTC trades at $109,841, down 1.8% in the past 24 hours.

Title: AI’s $1 Trillion Shakeout: Bubble, Correction, Or Market Reset
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2025/08/26/ais-1-trillion-shakeout-bubble-correction-or-market-reset/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T00:32:46Z
Full Content:
ByMark Minevich, Contributor. In recent weeks, AI investors and enterprise leaders have felt the yo-yo effect of the AI market. Starting August 18, a four-day slide erased almost $1 trillion from the market caps of tech’s megacap companies. Nvidia, Palantir, and other so-called AI companies shed billions in value in a matter of days. Meta has announced a hiring freeze in its AI division. Even the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, casually remarked that “AI is a bubble.” The irony? Engineers in the sector continue to command $100 million pay packages. AI startups continue to raise funding at valuations that defy gravity. Additionally, companies from Microsoft to Google are integrating AI features across their products at a record speed. The real question isn’t whether AI is a bubble. The better question is: what kind of bubble—if any—are we in, and what comes after? For much of the past 18 months, AI stocks soared based on projections and expectations. Nvidia tripled in value. Palantir’s valuations are reminiscent of the dot-com era. In August, the S&P’s price-to-book ratio reached 5.3, which is higher than the 2000 bubble peak. When valuations stretch that far, even small doubts can trigger outsized sell-offs. The rotation out of AI has been partly seasonal. August is historically weak for equities, and funds have been taking profits in overcrowded trades. However, the speed and depth of AI’s decline reveal something deeper: investors are finally asking tough questions about the business impact. New data fueled that scrutiny. A report from MIT showed that 95% of generative AI pilots fail to deliver any measurable return on investment. McKinsey research similarly found that while 8 in 10 companies deploy generative AI tools, most see no bottom-line gains. AI may be everywhere in boardrooms and demos, but it remains conspicuously absent from earnings statements. This fact is what caused markets to dip. The MIT statistic shouldn’t surprise seasoned executives. Many companies are treating AI as a marketing checkbox rather than a strategic capability. Money is being funneled into headline-grabbing initiatives, such as customer-facing chatbots and generative content tools. At the same time, the real ROI lies hidden in back-office automation, supply chain optimization, and finance functions. The most significant determinant of success isn’t the model itself, but how it’s adopted and integrated. Companies that prioritize impressive demos without redesigning workflows inevitably fail. By contrast, enterprises that embed AI into core processes (expense reporting, claims processing, compliance checks) consistently see measurable productivity gains. Another issue is the obsession with building in-house. For many organizations, partnering with trusted vendors provides faster time-to-value and avoids the talent bottleneck. Trying to replicate what OpenAI, Microsoft, or Google has already done internally often results in wasted human hours and failed pilots. Then there’s the problem of “agent sprawl.” As different departments spin up their own AI pilots, enterprises risk a patchwork of ungoverned tools, inconsistent security, and rising costs. Without a governance model that scales, these initiatives collapse under their own weight. The reality is that adoption strategy, not AI hype, determines ROI. The mixed signals coming from industry leaders further complicate the picture. Sam Altman’s “AI is a bubble” remark spooked investors, although insiders suggest his comments were directed at the valuations of huge startups, not giants like OpenAI or Nvidia. Some even speculate it was a tactical move, cooling off competitors such as Meta, which had been luring OpenAI engineers with $100 million signing packages. Meta’s AI hiring freeze may appear ominous on the surface, but the company is actually spending more than ever on AI infrastructure. The shift isn’t about retreat, but about moving from a talent land-grab to execution. In fact, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are quietly doubling down on AI integration across products that generate real revenue. Plus, Nvidia, despite stock swings, reported data center revenue up nearly 70% year-over-year. This further drives home the point that the infrastructure layer of AI is delivering tangible profits. The signs of a bubble are undeniable with valuations stretched to dot-com levels, engineers signing contracts worth nine figures and a 95% project failure rate in enterprise pilots. But there are equally strong signs that this is merely a correction. Unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders are not speculative bets; they’re profitable, cash-rich companies building foundational technologies. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google are not Pets.com. A more useful analogy may be the early internet. In 1995, valuations were huge, startups were burning cash, and most experiments failed. But beneath the noise, the infrastructure for a digital economy was being laid. The productivity payoff lagged the hype, but when it arrived, it reshaped the global economy. AI is following a similar trajectory. In the near term, volatility is unavoidable. Valuations will continue to be tested. Venture funding will tighten, forcing weak AI startups into consolidation or collapse. Public companies that heavily rely on AI marketing without demonstrating effective adoption will remain under pressure. The headlines and hype around $100 million salaries and “AI everywhere” marketing will cool. Many projects will be quietly wound down as the easy money phase of AI comes to an end. AI is not a feature, it is a general-purpose technology on par with electricity and the internet. It is already transforming healthcare, energy, finance, defense, logistics, and education. The productivity paradox is fundamental, as significant investments must come first and measurable gains follow later. Just as the internet required massive infrastructure before creating trillions in value, AI requires time to mature and integrate. By 2030, analysts project AI will add trillions of dollars to the global economy. Most startups will vanish, but the survivors (likely fewer than 5%) will dominate entire industries. The next decade will see the rise of new global giants, and the reshaping of competition across every sector. We’re not witnessing the end of AI, we’re witnessing the end of its hype cycle. The startup bubble is deflating. The talent war is cooling. But the underlying trend of AI as a driver of productivity, transformation, and new business models is only beginning. This is not a dot-com bus, but a recalibration of expectations. Execution will matter more than narrative. The adoption strategy will matter more than the experiments. Enterprises that focus on back-office productivity, integration, and governance will capture real ROI. In the short term, expect volatility, pain, and consolidation. In the long term, expect AI to weave into every industry and redefine productivity, creativity, and competition. Yes, some air is coming out, but AI itself is no bubble. The future belongs to AI. The only question is which enterprises will survive the shakeout and lead the next industrial revolution.

Title: AI Revolution Will Crush the Blue States

“The first step onto the corporate ladder is vanishing for many new graduates,” argued a recent Fortune report. As a result, CEOs are warning that entry-level jobs are on the brink of extinction, with internships and opportunities for college graduates drying up. Of course, not everyone will feel the impact in the same way. At the top of the pyramid are investors, entrepreneurs, and elite programmers who now command salaries on par with professional athletes. But artificial intelligence — fuelled by a huge infusion of Wall Street cash — threatens to eliminate many software jobs, along with high-end professional roles that involve routine analysis. Young people are acutely aware of this. In the class I teach with Marshall Koplansky at Chapman University, several students predicted that the jobs they currently hold will soon disappear. Among them were a game designer, two human-resources executives, and a manufacturing and warehouse manager. My engineering colleagues report a similar trend. While opportunities remain strong for mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as for those designing robotics, the outlook is far less certain for computer science students. Despite soaring profits at the largest tech companies, AI programming tools have enabled sweeping layoffs at firms such as Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Today, among college graduates aged 22-27, computer science and computer engineering majors face some of the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In response, many firms are now focusing on building tangible products rather than merely shifting algorithms for commerce or generating more social media. In the aerospace and defence sectors, for example, AI is seen not as an end but a tool. It is a means to enhance human creativity and productivity rather than replace it. “Software is not in the greatest position with AI,” Delian Asparouhov, who runs a firm focused on in-space manufacturing, told me. “Now people are shifting to hard tech. Designing and building spaceships still needs people.” This could spell trouble for elite universities, but represents a major advantage for schools that teach the practical skills companies actually need. So far, these opportunities are largely concentrated in red and purple states in the Midwest and South — the regions most focused on reshoring manufacturing and other industries from overseas. Attitudes are shifting alongside these economic changes. One recent survey found that roughly 83% of Generation Z feel that learning a skilled trade can be a better pathway to economic security than college — including 90% of those already holding college degrees. Indeed, as college enrolment has dropped between 2020 and 2023, trade school enrolment grew by 10%. These changes suggest that as practical skills gain value, regions offering them are likely to attract both talent and jobs. Read the rest of this piece at: UnHerd.

Title: Betting on Brazil’s Most Disruptive Stock

By Adam Sharp PostedAugust 26, 2025 Here at the Daily Reckoning, we love contrarian investments. Back in February, we highlighted an idea that fits the bill nicely: buying Brazilian stocks. Specifically, we mentioned the iShares Brazil ETF (EWZ), which was yielding around 8% at the time, and Nubank (NU), a fast-growing digital bank. Brazil had been in a slump since its stock market peaked in 2008. The country’s stock market is heavily tilted towards banks and commodities (especially oil and iron ore). Its currency has been volatile and generally fallen in value versus the dollar. So most investors have steered clear of the country. But this is starting to turn around. The largest Brazilian ETF, EWZ, is up around 10% since February and looking good. It remains dirt cheap with fat yields. The plan is to hold this one for many years, and possibly decades, to come. Let the magic of compounding do its work. But today we’re going to focus on Nubank, which at the time was a small position in my portfolio. Since that time, I’ve learned a lot more about Nubank (and bought more). And the outlook for this company is bright. Let’s dig into this remarkable growth story. Nubank is a fully-digital bank based in Brazil. It boasts a remarkable 122 million customers, nearly all of which use its popular mobile app. It offers checking and savings accounts, credit cards, personal loans, investment accounts, and more. The company just reported Q2 2025 results, and they handily beat expectations. This company’s growth has been wildly consistent. Since 2020, they’ve grown from around 20 million active customers to more than 102 million: Source: Fiscal.ai When we first highlighted Nubank back on February 25, 2025, shares were trading around $11.20. Today NU is up 23% to $14.20. But I don’t plan to sell anytime soon. This growth story looks to still be in its early stages. Nubank is currently used by around 60% of Brazilian adults, a remarkable achievement. Management has been focused on further monetizing these customers with loans, investment services, crypto offerings, insurance, business lending, and more. Nubank has many ways to further monetize its growing Brazilian user base. But the company is also expanding into Mexico and Colombia, with significant progress so far. In Mexico, Nubank has 12 million customers representing 13% of the total population. In Colombia, the company has 3.4 million customers, or nearly 10% of that country’s total population. It seems likely that Nubank will continue expanding across Latin America. Its digital banking model is low cost, with no physical locations or real estate expenses. The model is beautiful and Nubank has the potential to gobble up market share from existing banks across Latam (and possibly beyond). Brazil has been in an economic slump for a while now. Innovative growth stories like Nubank are few and far between. So the market generally pays less for Brazilian stocks than they do for American equivalents. Today Nubank trades at a trailing P/E ratio of around 30. For a company growing revenue and earnings around 40%, that’s a very fair price. If Nubank were an American firm, I can’t even imagine how high its valuation would be. Suffice to say 4x higher might be on the low side. On the whole, I think Nubank is trading at an extremely fair price today and don’t plan to sell anytime soon. Of course, NU is still an emerging market investment. If Brazil were to go through a currency or banking crisis, Nubank would almost certainly take a big hit in the short-term (along with everything else). Still, it’s a risk I’m willing to take in order to access the potential upside. We’ll keep readers updated on Nubank and the larger Brazil investment theme.

Title: Sens. Alsobrooks & Hagerty Are Attempting To Make Banks Big By Decree

ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. Through the CFPB’s anti-progress attempt to price control some of the financial products of the U.S.’s most successful financial institutions (see attempts to maintain Rule 1033), we’ve happened upon a truth about what makes big banks big: they invest staggering sums on infrastructure meant to improve the customer experience, and they similarly spend staggering sums to protect the accounts and information of those who bank with them. It’s a crucial reminder of what politicians are all-too-frequently unaware of: there are no shortcuts to success. Success doesn’t just happen, and it’s certainly not an effect of governmental decree. Instead, the big get that way by not just meeting the needs of existing and would-be customers, but well exceeding them. The truths about the corporate cultures that lend themselves to greatness are truths that Sens. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD) and James Hagerty (R-TN) would be wise to internalize. That’s because at present, the two senators are trying to make financial institutions big by decree. The speculation here is that they’ll fail. Evidence supporting the above claim can be found in the Senators’ proposal to alter Deposit Insurance Fund coverage. Specifically, they would increase deposit insurance per account to $20 million for institutions with assets under $250 billion, all the while maintaining the $250,000 per account deposit insurance cap for institutions with more than $250 billion in assets. What’s most galling about the proposed legislation isn’t the blatant regulatory favoritism, it’s that it aims to make smaller financial institutions bigger not through competitive advances, but just because. Yes, the Senators are regulating a shortcut to success that won’t just likely fail, but that is quite simply dangerous. Perhaps not asked enough by the Senators is why some banks are enormous by U.S. standards, some are medium size, and some are small. This doesn’t just happen, as much as it’s an effect of highly effective banking practices at the top of the U.S. size pyramid. If readers doubt any of the above, they need only travel back in time to the Spring of 2024 when J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon broached the possibility of moving his retirement time up. The instant reaction from the stock market was a 4.5% correction in JPM’s shares that shaved $25 billion off the institution’s market capitalization. Well, there’s your answer. J.P. Morgan and other banks at the top that compete with it aren’t big for random reasons, but because they can lay claim to some of the best financial talent in the world. Please contemplate this truth as Sens. Alsobrooks and Hagerty pursue regulatory favoritism that would allow smaller banks to offer customers deposit insurance at a level that JPM, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and many other large banks presently cannot. Assuming the favoritism works even a little, banks that were small for a variety of reasons would suddenly be faced with the challenging prospect of putting much more sizable amounts of money to work. This is no easy feat, and since it’s not, banks and the system more broadly would be imperiled by the favoritism. Let’s not do it. Instead, let’s encourage banks to compete on product and services, not regulatory handouts. Specifically, smaller banks have been hamstrung since 2008 by all manner of price controls on debit, credit and other services that have limited their ability to compete. In short, remove regulations rather than impose them. For all banks. And let the competition begin. As J.P. Morgan Chase’s growth under Dimon attests, there’s no reason that small and medium-sized can’t grow large. Just the same, there are no shortcuts to success.

Title: How Overworked CFOs Can Focus On What’s Most Important

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. The U.S. has always tied the success of its companies to the success of the country to some degree. Last week, President Donald Trump made a literal connection between the two, brokering a deal for the U.S. to take a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel. With this deal, the federal government will be the third-largest stakeholder in the publicly traded company, with its 10% share only behind a pair of 13% stakes held by Blackrock and Vanguard. Intel had been promised close to $11 billion to support its manufacturing facilities through former President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act. The equity stake is being cast as a redirection of those funds. While there is precedent for the government taking a stake in private companies, it’s generally only happened in times of widely recognized crisis. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the U.S. Treasury received stock warrants to prop up struggling commercial airlines—which were sold at an auction last year. During the Great Recession, the federal government purchased assets from failing banks to prevent a collapse of the financial system. And during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency during the Great Depression, the federal government provided financial support for banks, railroads and other companies in danger of collapse. Intel, which was one of the world’s hottest companies during the PC boom in the ‘90s, has had a relatively slow spell, but it’s nowhere near the point of imminent collapse. CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been working to reinvigorate and refocus the chip maker since he took the helm in March, laying off employees, slowing down new facilities, and focusing on finding customers before increasing manufacturing capacity. Many policymakers and economists criticized Trump’s decision, saying it exposed the government to market risk, takes a step toward state-controlled industry and socialism, and is bringing unprecedented government intrusion into business. Trump dismissed those critics as “stupid,” and promised to make more deals like the one with Intel. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick identified defense contractor Lockheed Martin as a potential recipient in a Tuesday morning interview with CNBC. This is only the latest example of Trump’s involvement in the business sector. In June, he allowed Nippon Steel’s merger with U.S. Steel to proceed by claiming a “golden share” in the business, giving the federal government special powers over how the U.S. part of the company is run. Last month, the Defense Department became the largest shareholder in rare earth mining company MP Materials. And a deal he made with Nvidia and AMD to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from chip sales to China came to light earlier this month. It’s clear that Trump does not follow a traditional governing playbook, but the administration’s heavier hand in business operations could impact both corporate bottom lines and the economy as a whole going forward. With other factors at play—including tariffs, interest rates, currency values and a potentially volatile stock market—the next three and a half years will be interesting for corporate finance. In today’s world, there are many things competing for the CFO’s attention, and it can be difficult to prioritize. I talked to Chris Sands, InvoiceCloud CFO, about how he drowns out the noise of everything else going on and harnesses the CFO’s ability to bring change to an organization. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday. President Donald Trump has been very direct in his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which has held baseline interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5% since December. But on Monday night, he took his boldest step against the Fed yet, sending Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook a letter immediately firing her from her position. The letter, which Trump shared on his Truth Social platform, says that the president can remove governors for cause. Trump writes he believes Cook may have committed mortgage fraud, potentially making a false statement on a mortgage agreement. Cook has denied the accusation, and said in a statement shared with several news organizations that there is no cause under the law for her to be fired, and that the president has no authority to do so. She also said she will not resign, and will continue to serve out her term. Cook’s attorney Abbe Lowell said she will file a lawsuit challenging “this illegal action.” Experts say that Trump’s reasoning is legally dubious. Cook hasn’t been formally charged with a crime, hasn’t been given a chance to respond to accusations, and the alleged misconduct happened before Cook was confirmed to her Fed position, meaning the Senate and president could have vetted it during the advice and consent process. Previous Supreme Court rulings about firing members of independent boards found that they could only be fired for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Trump has been steadily attacking the Fed, and specifically Chairman Jerome Powell, since he took office. He reportedly weighed firing Powell outright, and is already searching for the person to succeed him when his term ends next year. Economists, scholars and critics told the Wall Street Journal that Trump’s actions put the U.S. into “uncharted waters,” since the Federal Reserve was designed to regulate financial policy outside of politics. Stocks have been volatile since Trump’s announcement regarding Cook, but are roughly unchanged from Monday. The irony is that the current Fed Governing Board may be poised to give Trump the interest rate cut he wants. At the Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming last week, Powell said, “With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” According to CME FedWatch, 87.3% of economists predict a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed’s meeting next month. The stock market has recently been on a tear, with the S&P 500’s total value up 83% in the last five years. But some wary investors are looking at the rapid rise and the big players, and envisioning a replay of the dotcom bubble a quarter century ago, writes Forbes’ Hank Tucker. Today, much like the late ‘90s, the IT sector makes up more than 33% of the S&P 500 index. And just like investors a quarter century ago bought up shares in internet companies, today’s investors are going all in on AI. Rob Arnott, founder and chairman of investment advisor Research Affiliates, told Tucker that today’s top companies tend to be great companies with great products, but bubbles burst when the margins are wrong—and they seem unrealistically optimistic around some of today’s high flyers. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told The Verge he thinks the AI market is in a bubble. Considering that Altman is one of the primary figures that started the boom, Forbes contributor Paulo Carvão writes, it’s worth heeding the warning. The wage gap between CEOs and workers at the 100 lowest-paying firms on the S&P 500 widened nearly 13% between 2019 and 2024, according to a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies. Starbucks had the largest gap—CEO Brian Niccol made $95.8 million last year, while the median pay for a worker was just $14,674. In the last five years, the report found that CEO pay at those companies increased 34.7%. Average median worker pay, on the other hand, was up just 16.3%. At 22 of those companies, median worker pay actually dropped since 2019. The report found that these wide salary gaps tend to widen gender and racial disparities at large, since many low wage workers are women and people of color, and few large companies have female or minority CEOs. There’s always a lot going on in today’s business world, and companies are counting on their CFOs to not only balance the books, but provide strategy to help them succeed going forward. Chris Sands, CFO at billing and payment solutions company InvoiceCloud, has focused on drowning out the noise that gets to the CFO’s office and concentrating on what’s the most important. I talked to him about how to find those functions and make sure that’s the work that a CFO does. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What are some things that today’s CFOs are getting wrapped up in that are adding unnecessary complexity to their jobs? Sands: Using AI today as an example, it’s a very topical, very important, powerful technology that has a lot of implications. We’re an AI-forward organization, and there’s pressure on all of our leaders across the different functional areas to figure out what the best AI use cases are, how to adopt that, how to deploy that. But when I think about finance, and the use cases that exist today, and the maturity of the solutions out there to address it and the opportunity, it is not necessarily the area where I think there’s the most bang for the bucks. I think about how I use my time as a CFO. Is it better spent trying to be way ahead of the curve on AI use cases in the finance function, or figure out where, broadly across the business, we can deploy AI to get the biggest bang for the buck in the overall return on the business? I think it’s the latter, using my purview from the org as well as the skillset that comes with finance and FP&A and the like to help the org figure out how to best deploy AI, as opposed to becoming too myopic. I’d say most of the things that come across the desk are important, and there’s value in doing them, but there’s a finite amount of hours in the day. It’s all about how do you understand what’s most impactful, and then prioritize accordingly and follow through on that. If you’re not super disciplined about understanding what the most important drivers of the business are, prioritizing them and making progress on those, you could easily slip into spending too much time with less-impactful things, and that’s overall going to be bad for the business. What should the CFO’s priorities be? There’s a CFO that can tell you what’s going on in the business, and that’s probably an okay person. There’s a person that can tell you what’s going on and what should happen in the business, and that’s pretty good. The top tier would be people that can tell you what needs to happen in the business, and then go make it happen. I strive to be the top one. To me, the most important part of the job is understanding how the business works and what matters for the business. Being not just the custodian of the finance function, financial statements, board reporting and all of that, but being kind-of like the chief analyst of the business. Understanding for each business what makes it tick? Where are the opportunities? And then how do you make improvements against where those opportunities are? It starts there from there as you determine what the top priorities are, what the potential impact on the business is. How do you kind of ruthlessly prioritize and say no to other things? I find that to be the hardest part of it, because there’s always demands from different angles on how to spend the time, and things that need to be done in the business. Oftentimes, the biggest, most strategic things that are potentially needle-moving for the business don’t have a firm timeline or pressure coming from the board, CEO or others, so it’s easy to deprioritize those—but that is to the detriment of the business. By relentlessly prioritizing and following up, you’re much more likely to make sure you’re spending your time in the right way. Once you’ve identified where the opportunities are and what the business needs to do, how do you actually become a change agent? I find that the storytelling piece is maybe the hardest for folks with the finance DNA, just because it’s a little more creative and not necessarily typical for the profile. But by crafting the narrative around what’s important for the business—how to do it—and winning over the hearts and minds of colleagues and board is how you start to influence change. How can a CFO put together a finance department that reinforces the focus that they need to have? Having folks that are grounded in what they need to do, good at what they do, probably gets you 80%, 90% of the way there. The way you set goals and motivate the org is incredibly important. Most organizations go through annual goal setting, but setting up a framework to set goals that are achievable will help in sticking with those through the year. I think it helps keep people grounded. If all of a sudden, you’re just reacting to everything that’s coming up, you’re doing folks a disservice. Something I see all the time, especially in the private equity landscape, is a request comes down from the board and the CFO says, ‘I got this request. I don’t fully understand what exactly they want it for or what they’re looking for, but boy, are we going to blow them away with the analysis we’re going to do.’ As opposed to having the ability to interact with the board or CEO in and say, ‘Help me understand what it is you want to get to and what you’re after, and I’ll help you figure out the best way to get there.’ I find that is a huge stress reliever on the finance org, who typically comes up with all of these things falling in their lap. It just creates a ton of churn in the org. Having the ability to understand what matters, not just for the business, but to your investors, what they’re after and what you’re able to do to help them get what they need. That’s the No. 1 piece of advice I give to first-time CFOs in the private equity setting: Build that relationship and dynamic with the board and investors, so you’re not unnecessarily burdening and taxing your org. It just is exhausting for everyone, and it deludes from the focus on things that actually matter more for the business. Financial software can be vital to your company’s operations, but it can also make things less efficient and more costly. Here’s how you can take a look at what you have and try to make it work best for your company. (And no, that doesn’t mean just add AI.) It doesn’t matter if you agree with President Trump that “tariff” is the most beautiful word in the dictionary. They’re coming and will impact your business. If you’re a small business, here are three ways to prepare to keep your finances afloat as big changes are coming. This week, Keurig Dr Pepper announced its plans to acquire which beverage company? A. La Croix parent National Beverage Corp B. Coffee and tea giant JDE Peet’s C. Energy drink maker Monster Beverage Corporation D. Fiji Water parent The Wonderful Company See if you got the right answer here.

All eyes are on Nvidia heading into the artificial intelligence chip giant's second-quarter earnings report, due after markets close later today. As the world's most valuable public company, Nvidia (NVDA) has more influence than any over the value of the S&P 500 and the more than $1 trillion indexed to it. With a market capitalization of about $4.4 trillion, Nvidia accounts for about 8% of the benchmark index, a whole percentage point more than its next largest component, Microsoft (MSFT). Nvidia's stock is expected to post its biggest post-earnings stock move in over a year, according to recent options pricing. That could translate into a market response that resembles that of a pivotal piece of economic data more than a single company's earnings report. Options data suggests traders expect the S&P 500 to move about 0.9% in either direction on Thursday, the first day of trading after Nvidia's report. The S&P 500 moved more than 0.9% on nearly a third of all trading days this year through Tuesday. But that figure is inflated by the tariff tumult that gripped markets in March and April, when the index jumped or fell by at least 1 percentage point on more than half of trading days. So far in the relatively calmer second half of the year, the index has moved more than 0.9% approximately one out of every 10 days. Nvidia's size isn't the only reason its earnings might move the whole market. It has also become an AI bellwether that can move the stocks of AI beneficiaries spanning a range of industries. The company's results, as a gauge of AI demand, exert significant influence over other semiconductor stocks. When Nvidia's results sent its shares plunging more than 8% in late February, the benchmark PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 6%, and not just because Nvidia accounts for about 9% of the index. The stocks of fellow chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) tumbled more than 7% the same day, as did chip fabrication equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT). As the notion of what constitutes an "AI stock" has expanded, so has Nvidia's influence. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST), nuclear power providers that have struck major data center deals with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOGL), plunged more than 7% and 12%, respectively, following Nvidia's results in February. Server makers Dell (DELL) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) saw their shares fall nearly 7% and 16%, respectively, while software provider Palantir (PLTR) slid 5%. The ripple effects of Nvidia's earnings could be even more pronounced now because AI beneficiaries and the "Magnificent Seven," after big gains this year, make up more of the S&P 500 than they did in February. Palantir has added roughly three-quarters of its value in the past 6 months, while Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained more than 50%. Broadcom, one of just nine U.S. companies worth more than $1 trillion, has climbed by more than a third in the same period. Before Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech sent stocks soaring last Friday, tech and AI stocks were having a rough week. Palantir last Wednesday notched its longest losing streak in more than a year. An ETF tracking the "Magnificent Seven" stocks slid 3.5% over the first four days of the week. Investor concerns about an AI bubble, which have repeatedly bubbled up over the past few years, resurfaced last week. Wall Street was unnerved by an MIT survey that found nearly all companies have seen no material benefits from their AI investments. And Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, reportedly said the prior week that investors had become “overexcited” about AI. Those headlines amplified worries that tech valuations had become stretched after a strong rebound off April's "Liberation Day" lows. The S&P 500 IT sector index has risen about 50% since bottoming out on April 8, far outpacing the 30% gain for the S&P 500 as a whole. UPDATE—Aug. 27, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent options and stock prices.

Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaking giant at the center of the artificial intelligence revolution, has delivered huge returns for investors since its meteoric rise in 2023 and 2024. But the world's most valuable company, led by the so-called "Godfather of AI," CEO Jensen Huang, has investments of its own. The company is required to disclose its portoflio information every quarter using the SEC Form 13-F. This filing offers only a snapshot of Nvidia's portfolio at the end of the quarter. It does not provide any details about gains or losses made from any sales made during the quarter. Here's what Nvidia's AI best looked like at the end of June— By far Nvidia's most valuable holding is CoreWeave Inc. (CRWV), an AI cloud computing provider that went public in March. At the end of June, Nvidia held 24.3 million shares, that amounts to roughly 7% stake in the company, worth a little over $3.9 billion. As of Aug. 26, that stake is valued is close to $2.2 billion, after Coreweave saw almost a third of its share value disappear following disappointing quarterly earnings results. However, shares of CoreWeave have more than doubled from their IPO price of $40 in March to more than $90 in late August. Arm Holdings plc (ARM) is a U.K.-based developer of CPU chip designs whose clients include Nvidia, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google. Nvidia reported a stake of 1.1 million Arm shares worth $178 million in June (about $154 million as of Aug. 26). Applied Digital Corp. (APLD) provides data center space to companies seeking AI compute infrastructure. Its shares have more than doubled this year, including a huge gain after the company agreed to lease data center operations to fellow Nvidia partner CoreWeave. Nvidia held 7.7 million shares of Applied Digital. That position, which was worth about $77 million at the end of June, has grown to over $125 million as of Aug. 26. Nebius Group NV (NBIS) is an Amsterdam-based provider of AI infrastructure. Nvidia first disclosed its 1.2 million-share stake in the company in February, and its stock has jumped more than two-thirds since. That means Nvidia's investment has only grown, from nearly $65 million in June to about $85 million at the end of August. Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RXRX), a biotech firm focused on AI-powered drug discovery. It's also another Nvidia investment that has seen its stock fall this year, dropping 27%. Nvidia held 7.7 million shares of Recursion as of June 30. Chinese autonomous vehicle manufacturer WeRide Inc. (WRD) operates a fleet spanning 30 cities across nine countries. Its shares spiked after Nvidia revealed a 1.7-million share stake in February, but they've lost about a third of their value in 2025. Nvidia's portfolio has largely been successful this year, with stocks like CoreWeave actually outperforming the chipmaker itself so far in 2025. Nvidia stock has been no slouch, though, gaining 33% this year and hitting a record high of $182.70 earlier this month. The company is due to report quarterly results after the market closes Wednesday, and AI investors will be watching for clues from Huang about the state of the sector.

Title: S&P 500's Weight In Mag 7 Stocks Passes 30%. Is This A Diversification Risk?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/sp-500-weight-mag-7-stocks-diversification-risk/

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, but only a small percentage have the power to move the index on their own. Among those elite companies are the Magnificent 7—seven stocks that helped drive the S&P 500 to 20%-plus gains in 2023 and 2024. Thanks to their collective success, the Magnificent 7 stocks comprise over one-third of the S&P 500—prompting many investors to wonder if it’s time to worry about concentration risk. Let’s answer that question by reviewing the key factors, potential diversification strategies and expert commentary about the historically high Mag 7 concentration. The Magnificent 7 Stocks are: These seven stocks comprised about 36% of the S&P 500 large-cap index. The remaining 64% of the index was spread across 493 other companies. The Mag 7 concentration first stretched above 30% in 2023. Only eight years prior, these stocks accounted for 12.4% of the S&P 500. By 2022, the concentration had risen to 21.6%. In those years, the collective market capitalization of the Mag 7 companies rose from $2.2 trillion to $6.9 trillion. Today, their total market cap exceeds $19 trillion. The growth has been driven by technology innovation and leadership. Nvidia's success in AI has been particularly influential. It encouraged other tech leaders to sharpen their AI focus and positioned AI as a major wealth opportunity for investors. The S&P 500 weights its constituents using a free-float market capitalization method, which assigns higher weights to larger companies. As a result, larger companies have greater influence over the index than smaller companies. Free-float market cap is the market value of a public company, calculated as the share price times the number of available shares. A stock’s free-float market capitalization relative to the aggregate market cap of the index determines its weight. The total market cap of the S&P 500 is about $54.3 trillion. The largest index member is Nvidia, which has a market cap of $4.4 trillion. To calculate Nvidia's weight in the index, divide $4.4 trillion by $54.3 trillion—which equates to about 8%. Stock price changes affect a company's market capitalization, which in turn influences the index. A company’s weighting in an index can increase when its stock performs better than others, assuming there's no corresponding change in share count. A change to one company's weighting changes all the weightings, since the weighting total is always 100%. Equal-weighted indexes give each constituent the same influence over the group. For example, an equal-weighted S&P 500 fund weights each company at 0.2%. In practice, this means a price increase from Nvidia is as influential as a price increase from Enphase Energy (ENPH), the smallest company in the S&P 500. Note that the S&P 500 contains 503 stocks representing 500 companies. The three additional stocks relate to companies with multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's (GOOG) and (GOOGL). Invesco's S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) splits Alphabet's total weighting across its two share classes. Since 2023, Mag 7 concentration has contributed to a cumulative S&P 500 gain of 68.4%. In the same timeframe, Invesco’s RSP ETF gained 34.2%. That means market-cap weighting of the Mag 7 concentration has roughly doubled the gains for S&P 500 investors over the last two years. Some of the Mag 7 have continued to be among the best stocks of 2025. As long as the group outperforms, the high concentration enhances S&P 500 returns. Securities that can rise quickly can also fall quickly. There is a chance investors will become disillusioned with AI and technology stocks. Some analysts suggest this is already happening. Last week, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks dipped after an MIT report suggested that AI investments are not producing measurable returns. These quick pullbacks happen because investors have high growth expectations for these tech leaders. Any sign of a more modest growth trajectory can prompt investors to sell. So, just as Mag 7 outperformance can lift the S&P 500, underperformance of this group can drag the entire S&P 500 down. You can reduce your Mag 7 concentration risk by eliminating redundant funds, reallocating capital to an equal-weight fund or adding exposures to asset types that don't overlap with the S&P 500. The first step to managing Mag 7 concentration risk is understanding how much exposure you have. Review your holdings and note any funds with overlapping portfolios. If you have an S&P 500 fund, market-cap weighted funds targeting any of the following groups will have overlapping Mag 7 exposure: More specifically, if you're worried about Mag 7 concentration risk, you shouldn’t have your entire net worth split between, say, SPY and QQQ. Pick one or reduce your exposure to both. You can also shift some of your existing S&P 500 exposure to an equal-weighted fund. The amount you move depends on your outlook for the Mag 7. If you believe the technology run is largely played out, you could drop the market-cap-weighted exposure entirely. Or, you could take a more modest approach and move 25% of your market-cap-weighted S&P 500 funds into an equal-weighted fund. This would dilute your concentration slightly but still provide upside if Nvidia and friends continue creating value. The S&P 500 is a large-cap index. It has no exposure to small caps, mid caps or international stocks. You could therefore dilute your Mag 7 exposure by investing in these categories via individual stocks or funds. If you are investing in a taxable account with unrealized gains, this reallocation will have tax consequences. You could delay the tax liability by changing the composition of your future trades instead of selling to rebalance. This would shift your exposure gradually. Or, if you're worried about an imminent dip in Mag 7 stocks, sell off a chunk of your S&P 500 exposure and use the proceeds to pay taxes and add the new holdings. In interviews, two experts characterized the Mag 7 concentration risk as worthy of caution, but not panic. Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement, notes that most of the Mag 7 companies have strong business models and healthy balance sheets. And while their valuations are high, they are “not overly outlandish,” in Yoshioka’s view. She says concentration risk is a concern, “but timing when it will become a material consequence to overall index returns is difficult to predict.” Dion Hinchcliffe, vice president and CIO practice lead at Futurum Group, believes Mag 7 dominance will continue to enhance returns in the short term. But longer term, the dynamic will change. Signs to watch for include slowing AI monetization and rising investor interest in lagging sectors. Hinchcliffe says, “The danger isn’t just the Mag 7 falling, it’s that the rest of the index is simply too weak to pick up the slack when they do.” Bottom Line The high concentration of the Mag 7 in the S&P 500 increases the index’s potential volatility, but also enhances returns. While there aren’t definitive signs the Mag 7 stocks are losing momentum, they won’t remain dominant forever. Diversification into other asset types can prep your portfolio for that shift. Who Are the Mag 7 Stocks in the S&P 500? The Mag 7 stocks in the S&P 500 are Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA). Is It A Concern If 30% Of The Index Is In 7 Stocks? A 30% concentration of seven stocks in one index is a concern if all seven stocks share similar behaviors. The Mag 7 stocks are technology-focused growth companies that have, at times, risen and fallen together. That behavior can encourage excess volatility in the S&P 500. How Can I Diversify Away from Mag 7 Risk? You can diversify away from Mag 7 risk by adding small-cap, mid-cap and international stock exposure to your portfolio. You could also opt for an equal-weight S&P 500 fund instead of a traditional market-cap-weighted S&P 500 fund. Has This Level of Concentration Happened Before? The concentration of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 has historically remained below 30%, averaging 24% according to Visual Capitalist. Before 2023, the last high point in the concentration of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks was 28% in 1970.

In practice, this means a price increase from Nvidia is as influential as a price increase from Enphase Energy (ENPH), the smallest company in the S&P 500. Note that the S&P 500 contains 503 stocks representing 500 companies. The three additional stocks relate to companies with multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's (GOOG) and (GOOGL). Invesco's S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) splits Alphabet's total weighting across its two share classes. Since 2023, Mag 7 concentration has contributed to a cumulative S&P 500 gain of 68.4%. In the same timeframe, Invesco’s RSP ETF gained 34.2%. That means market-cap weighting of the Mag 7 concentration has roughly doubled the gains for S&P 500 investors over the last two years. Some of the Mag 7 have continued to be among the best stocks of 2025. As long as the group outperforms, the high concentration enhances S&P 500 returns. Securities that can rise quickly can also fall quickly. There is a chance investors will become disillusioned with AI and technology stocks. Some analysts suggest this is already happening. Last week, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks dipped after an MIT report suggested that AI investments are not producing measurable returns. These quick pullbacks happen because investors have high growth expectations for these tech leaders. Any sign of a more modest growth trajectory can prompt investors to sell. So, just as Mag 7 outperformance can lift the S&P 500, underperformance of this group can drag the entire S&P 500 down. You can reduce your Mag 7 concentration risk by eliminating redundant funds, reallocating capital to an equal-weight fund or adding exposures to asset types that don't overlap with the S&P 500. The first step to managing Mag 7 concentration risk is understanding how much exposure you have. Review your holdings and note any funds with overlapping portfolios. If you have an S&P 500 fund, market-cap weighted funds targeting any of the following groups will have overlapping Mag 7 exposure: More specifically, if you're worried about Mag 7 concentration risk, you shouldn’t have your entire net worth split between, say, SPY and QQQ. Pick one or reduce your exposure to both. You can also shift some of your existing S&P 500 exposure to an equal-weighted fund. The amount you move depends on your outlook for the Mag 7. If you believe the technology run is largely played out, you could drop the market-cap-weighted exposure entirely. Or, you could take a more modest approach and move 25% of your market-cap-weighted S&P 500 funds into an equal-weighted fund. This would dilute your concentration slightly but still provide upside if Nvidia and friends continue creating value. The S&P 500 is a large-cap index. It has no exposure to small caps, mid caps or international stocks. You could therefore dilute your Mag 7 exposure by investing in these categories via individual stocks or funds. If you are investing in a taxable account with unrealized gains, this reallocation will have tax consequences. You could delay the tax liability by changing the composition of your future trades instead of selling to rebalance. This would shift your exposure gradually. Or, if you're worried about an imminent dip in Mag 7 stocks, sell off a chunk of your S&P 500 exposure and use the proceeds to pay taxes and add the new holdings. In interviews, two experts characterized the Mag 7 concentration risk as worthy of caution, but not panic. Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement, notes that most of the Mag 7 companies have strong business models and healthy balance sheets. And while their valuations are high, they are “not overly outlandish,” in Yoshioka’s view. She says concentration risk is a concern, “but timing when it will become a material consequence to overall index returns is difficult to predict.” Dion Hinchcliffe, vice president and CIO practice lead at Futurum Group, believes Mag 7 dominance will continue to enhance returns in the short term. But longer term, the dynamic will change. Signs to watch for include slowing AI monetization and rising investor interest in lagging sectors. Hinchcliffe says, “The danger isn’t just the Mag 7 falling, it’s that the rest of the index is simply too weak to pick up the slack when they do.” Bottom Line The high concentration of the Mag 7 in the S&P 500 increases the index’s potential volatility, but also enhances returns. While there aren’t definitive signs the Mag 7 stocks are losing momentum, they won’t remain dominant forever. Diversification into other asset types can prep your portfolio for that shift. Who Are the Mag 7 Stocks in the S&P 500? The Mag 7 stocks in the S&P 500 are Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA). Is It A Concern If 30% Of The Index Is In 7 Stocks? A 30% concentration of seven stocks in one index is a concern if all seven stocks share similar behaviors. The Mag 7 stocks are technology-focused growth companies that have, at times, risen and fallen together. That behavior can encourage excess volatility in the S&P 500. How Can I Diversify Away from Mag 7 Risk? You can diversify away from Mag 7 risk by adding small-cap, mid-cap and international stock exposure to your portfolio. You could also opt for an equal-weight S&P 500 fund instead of a traditional market-cap-weighted S&P 500 fund. Has This Level of Concentration Happened Before? The concentration of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 has historically remained below 30%, averaging 24% according to Visual Capitalist. Before 2023, the last high point in the concentration of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks was 28% in 1970.

Title: Banking On Financials - 3 Undervalued Bank Stocks

ByJohn Buckingham, Contributor. The banking sector has hardly been on a smooth ride in recent years. Between rate volatility, regulatory uncertainty and heightened investor skepticism following the regional banking crisis of 2023, many bank stocks remain deeply discounted relative to their long-term earnings power. Yet when I look at the numbers today, I see plenty of reasons to be optimistic about what lies ahead. A terrific signal of confidence came in June, when the Federal Reserve released its annual Stress Test results. Even under a hypothetical scenario of 10% unemployment, a 50% equity market decline, and steep drops in commercial and residential real estate prices, the nation’s largest banks maintained capital levels well above regulatory minimums. That resilience has allowed management teams to raise dividends and restart or continue share repurchases. Let’s take a closer look at three names I believe are especially well-positioned today: U.S. Bancorp (USB) - USB has long been known for its conservative credit culture and steady fee income from payments, wealth management and mortgage banking. After a tough stretch, earnings are expected to rebound meaningfully, with EPS projected to grow from $3.98 in 2024 to $5.16 in 2027. Shares currently trade for less than 11x the estimate for the next 12 months, among the lowest in the large-cap bank group, while they yield a healthy 4.2%. With its broad Midwest and Western footprint, and strong partnerships with State Farm and Edward Jones, I see USB as a quality franchise available at an attractive price. PNC Financial (PNC) - PNC has leaned into its “brilliantly boring” brand, and the numbers for the large regional bank back it up. After a flat 2024, EPS is forecast to climb 10% in 2025 and another 12% in 2026, reaching $19 by 2027. At less than 11x forward earnings, the stock looks inexpensive relative to that trajectory. The dividend yield of 3.4% provides additional support, and with capital levels robust, I wouldn’t be surprised to see stepped-up buybacks in the coming quarters. I’m also encouraged by new leadership, as the addition of former BlackRock executive Mark Wiedman signals a greater emphasis on wealth and asset management integration—areas that could lift growth further. Bank OZK (OZK) - Smaller in size but no less impressive in execution, Arkansas-based regional bank OZK continues to deliver industry-leading profitability, supported by its Real Estate Specialties Group and conservative underwriting discipline. Earnings are expected to grow steadily, from $6.04 in 2024 to nearly $7.00 in 2027. Even after a strong run from the April lows, shares trade for only 8x estimated earnings, a deep discount for a bank with peer-leading returns on equity. The dividend yield stands at 3.4% and has grown at a double-digit rate over the past five years. Despite exposure to Commercial and Industrial lending, OZK offers a combination of conservative underwriting and a cost-conscious culture, as long-tenured management has long stressed credit discipline and risk-adjusted returns. Across these three institutions, I see a compelling mix of earnings momentum, strong capital positions, disciplined management and valuations that remain appealing. Inexpensive forward P/E ratios that we think should be higher and generous dividend yields compensating investors for their patience make for a compelling combination. No doubt, challenges remain as credit costs could rise and the policy backdrop is never static, but the combination of strong fundamentals and modest valuations makes me believe these banks should be included in a diversified portfolio of undervalued stocks. ***** For those who like what I have to say in this forum, further market analytics and stock picks can be found in my newsletter, The Prudent Speculator.

Title: Trump offers Cracker Barrel simple piece of advice to become 'WINNER' again after 'woke' logo rebrand backfires

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/26/2025 9:35:10 AM PDT by Morgana President Donald Trump could not resist offering his opinion on the great Cracker Barrel rebrand debate, urging the iconic American restauranteur to capitalize on their negative publicity for maximum brand awareness. 'Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,' Trump said. Cracker Barrel ignited a firestorm of criticism on social media last week after it announced their decision to remove 'Uncle Hershel' from the company logo in favor of a more minimalist design. 'Uncle Herschel' is the real-life relative of the brand's founder Dan Evins. The old emblem showed him sitting on a chair in front of the famous cracker barrel. Republicans loudly protested the redesign, complaining it amounted to the abandonment of American values. Trump urged the company to leverage the controversy for maximum profits. 'They got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right,' he wrote. 'Very tricky to do, but a great opportunity.' He proposed that the company announce a major news conference to announce changes to the greatly criticized rebrand. (Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ...

While Pepsi had been beating them in the supermarkets, Coke completely dominated restaurant (both chains and diners, etc.) fountains, leaving Pepsi with those brands they owned at the time (Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken). I am sure McDonald's pushed back on New Coke.

'Uncle Herschel' is the real-life relative of the brand's founder Dan Evins. The old emblem showed him sitting on a chair in front of the famous cracker barrel. Republicans loudly protested the redesign, complaining it amounted to the abandonment of American values. Trump urged the company to leverage the controversy for maximum profits. 'They got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right,' he wrote. 'Very tricky to do, but a great opportunity.'

Title: Nearly half of workers feel they’re stagnating, SurveyMonkey data shows

Let HR Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Between the need for skilled workers and employee demand for training, HR may want to prioritize L&D and agitate for a bigger budget next year. After several years of an employee-friendly economy, the pivot back to an employer’s market may feel like whiplash for many workers. Anxiety is up, and employees are fumbling for security in a time of widespread layoffs and shrinking opportunity. Benefits and salary budgets generally have stagnated, and employers have seemingly pared back learning and development as well. Respondents to HR Dive’s Identity of HR survey said training had dropped in importance at their organization, with only 5% saying it was a top priority this year, compared to 12% last year. As a result, recruiters have been looking for highly qualified candidates to fill certain roles, while some say overlooked talent can’t access the learning opportunities that might help them rise into those positions — creating a catch-22. AI skills have commanded much of the conversation around training, and reports have shown that few employers are investing in learning programs on the topic. A July report from BambooHR found roughly one-third of employers have offered such training, and a May report from Amazon Web Services showed many employers don’t even know what such training would look like. Between the need for skilled workers and employee demand for training, some HR professionals have shifted from a recruiting focus to one of retention and development; those eyeing a similar path may need to agitate for a bigger L&D budget next year. Concerned about the encroachment of AI on entry-level opportunities, Gen Z has shown it will particularly prioritize employers who can offer skill-building and continuous learning opportunities, with more than half of Gen Z workers telling Flexa as much.

Title: Rumored Ripple NDA Suggests Trump, BlackRock, And JP Morgan Are Working With XRP Ledger

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Rumors are spreading fast in the crypto world after a supposed leaked NDA linked Ripple to big names like Trump, BlackRock, and JPMorgan. According to a post by Stellar Rippler on X, the XRP Ledger may have ties to projects that connect digital identity, healthcare, and global settlement systems. At the same time, BlackRock’s new ETF, Trump’s healthcare policy moves, and JPMorgan’s focus on digital identity appear to fit into the same plan. The story began when an ex-banker using the alias @LordBelgrave claimed he had leaked one of Ripple’s NDAs with UBS. Most of the details were already in circulation, but one shocking part stood out, a reference to “Biometric Identity Mapping.” This idea points to technology connecting personal identity with global financial systems. It goes far beyond what many assumed Ripple was building. According to the leak, Ripple may be developing tools that link digital identity with payments despite CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s earlier warnings about government control. At the time, most thought he was only talking about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Healthcare already shows evidence of this. Wellgistics Health recently announced an XRP Ledger–based payment system that will serve 6,500 U.S. pharmacies. JPMorgan has already said that digital identity is the foundation of Web3. The World Economic Forum (WEF), describing how digital ID, compliance tracking, healthcare, and supply chains connect, promotes the same vision with its Blockchain Toolkit. Ripple’s involvement at high levels suggests it has a seat at the table. The leak looks even more critical when placed next to recent moves by global power players. BlackRock’s $XDNA ETF was launched on July 4th, the same day Trump pushed his “One Big Beautiful Bill” aimed at cutting healthcare costs. At the same time, Trump introduced his Digital Health Tech Ecosystem, while BlackRock’s ETF went live directly on the XRP Ledger. The timing makes it look like the moves are connected. JPMorgan continues to drive forward with digital identity projects that match what Ripple is building. Ripple’s DNA Protocol connects to healthcare, identity, and payments, and tries to bring these systems onto the blockchain. Ripple’s deals in Africa and the MENA region could not have happened randomly. Deals with Chipper Cash and Onafriq, plus DNA Protocol onboarding labs in African nations, show Ripple is not expanding randomly but appears to be using a targeted adoption strategy to spread the new system globally. Finally, photos of Brad Garlinghouse standing with leaders from the IMF, SWIFT, and Christine Lagarde raise a big question: was Ripple always meant to be the chosen rail for the coming identity-health-finance merger? The rumored NDA, combined with these strategic moves, leads many in the crypto world to believe the answer could be yes.

August 26, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Aug. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: $25 for that? Consumers are going elsewhere for lunch.

Time Published: 2025-08-26T15:30:38Z

Good morning. Last night, US President Donald Trump said he was firing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook "effective immediately." In a letter shared on Truth Social, Trump said there was "sufficient reason" to believe Cook had made false statements on mortgage agreements. In response, Cook said Trump has no authority to fire her and she will not resign. Meanwhile, in today's newsletter, fast casual chains like Chipotle and Cava are losing their freshness. What's on deck: Markets: Why Sydney Sweeney's jeans ad won't save American Eagle's stock. Tech: A mix of AI FOMO and fear is sweeping Hollywood. Business: Why Labubus are a billion-dollar bubble ready to burst. But first, the rise and fall of the fast-casual slop bowl. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Let's grab lunch — my treat. Anywhere you want, as long as it's not Chipotle, Cava, or Sweetgreen. You expect me to pay $25 for … that? They've been dubbed "slop bowls," those mounds of vegetables, grains, and a protein or two. They were all the rage in the 2010s. Now, they could be why some fast casual chains are losing out, BI's Emily Stewart writes. The complaints are piling up: warm, weird salads; ingredients combined in the wrong way; portions so small, customers are filming employees just to try and get more food. And for the privilege? A price tag that makes you want to hurl. "Value is front of mind for nearly every consumer right now, and I think these restaurants just don't have a sharp enough value proposition," says Zak Stambor, a senior retail and e-commerce analyst at EMARKETER. So consumers appear to be going elsewhere, to places where, if they're spending that kind of money, they can sit down and get a better experience. Places that feel more affordable, more satisfying. Places like Chili's. Chili's has been on a hot streak. In its most recent earnings report, the CEO of Chili's parent company, Brinker, took a victory lap, declaring: "Chili's is officially back, baby back." The chain posted impressive sales growth, pushing Brinker's revenue past Wall Street's expectations to $1.46 billion. Alex Fasciano, a senior equity research analyst at CFRA Research, noted that Darden Restaurants (which owns Olive Garden) and The Cheesecake Factory have also had a strong year. Part of that growth may come from value-conscious diners tired of paying more for less. "Why am I paying $25 for a burrito and chips and guac when I could pay maybe a little bit more and have full service?" Fasciano says. With more of us heading back into the office, many are only just realising how expensive these slop bowls have gotten. What started as a slightly more expensive, healthier alternative to fast food now feels overpriced and underwhelming. As America's slop bowl moment fades, the next big thing might just be a full plate and a fair price. 1. Trump has bought $100 million in bonds since starting his second term. That's according to a new filing from the Office of Government Ethics. The president's bond purchases could stand to benefit if the Federal Reserve cuts rates, which Trump has been pressuring the central bank to do for months. 2. Behind Palantir's bad month. The tech titan's stock was flying high in 2025, reaching a record high in mid-August before shares fell 17%. Investors are feeling hesitant about Palantir's stock for three reasons, but optimism remains strong around its long-term trajectory. 3. Sydney Sweeney can't keep American Eagle's stock afloat. Bank of America analysts cut their rating on the stock to "underperform," citing the negative impact of tariffs. Any positive impact from Sweeney's jeans ad, including its rise to meme stock fame last month, will get canceled out, the firm said. 1. How Hollywood is using AI on the hush. Entertainment giants like Netflix and Lionsgate have recently touted their embrace of AI, but the tech still has a stigma among the creative community. Five Hollywood insiders told BI they dread being associated with AI, and those who are using it are doing so in secret. 2. Meta continues to poach AI talent for its superintelligence team. Meta has recruited at least 10 previously unreported researchers from Google's DeepMind since July, according to LinkedIn data reviewed by BI. The tech giant has also targeted Scale AI, with six of its AI researchers announcing their departures to join Meta in recent weeks. 3. OpenAI ramps up its healthcare push with a new hire. The company has tapped Doximity cofounder Nate Gross to lead its growing healthcare business. OpenAI aims to sell directly to healthcare customers rather than power other companies' products, reflecting a larger pivot: it wants to own not just foundation models, but AI infrastructure and applications, too. 1. Why Labubus are a billion-dollar bubble ready to burst. The popular dolls are on track to do $1 billion in sales this year, according to EMARKETER. And although they are no Beanie Babies, it's hard to imagine that Labubus will still be popular years from now, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. 2. Burning Man kicks up business deals, too. Tech moguls, celebrities, and models flock to the Black Rock Desert every year for the Burning Man festival. But they do more than just party: Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and DreamWorks cofounder Jeffrey Katzenberg, are among the leaders who have made key business decisions amid the dusty festivities. 3. Why this app's CEO will cancel a user's $25K subscription. Dorsia lets its users snag reservations at top restaurants for either $175, $5,175, or $25,175 a year. CEO Marc Lotenberg says he's kicked several users off the platform since its launch in 2022, and told BI "being rude to servers" is a bannable offense. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI models to securely access external data and tools. Let us delve into understanding how to secure Spring AI MCP Servers with OAuth2. Spring AI is an extension of the popular Spring Boot framework that allows developers to integrate large language models (LLMs) and AI capabilities directly into their applications. It simplifies building intelligent features such as chatbots, recommendation engines, and natural language understanding within Spring-based systems. OAuth2 is an open-standard authorization framework that allows applications to securely access resources on behalf of a user. In the context of Spring AI MCP servers, OAuth2 ensures that only authorized clients can interact with AI services, protecting sensitive data and AI endpoints. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications connect LLMs to data and tools, like how USB-C connects devices to peripherals. It enables building agents and complex workflows by linking models with the world. Learn more about MCP here. Spring Security is a powerful framework for securing Spring applications. In the context of MCP servers, it ensures that only authorized clients can access AI model endpoints, protecting sensitive data and services. Key features of Spring Security for MCP servers: Using Spring Security, developers can: Overall, Spring Security provides the backbone for safely exposing AI model endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized clients can interact with the MCP server. Add these dependencies to your pom.xml: Define a controller that provides realistic stock data in MCP format. In production, you could fetch real stock data from APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance. This Spring Boot controller, annotated with @RestController and @RequestMapping("/stocks"), provides a simple API to fetch stock information. It stores stock symbols and their prices in an immutable Map called stockPrices. The @GetMapping("/{symbol}") method takes a stock symbol as a path variable, looks up the price, and if not found, throws a ResponseStatusException with a 404 status. If the stock exists, it creates a Map containing the symbol, price, currency (“USD”), company name (determined by the private getCompanyName method using a switch expression), and the current timestamp. The resulting map is returned as JSON when the API endpoint is called. Enable OAuth2 security for your MCP server: This Spring configuration class, annotated with @Configuration, sets up security for the application using Spring Security. It defines a SecurityFilterChain bean that customizes HTTP security. CSRF protection is disabled with csrf().disable() and CORS support is enabled using cors(). The configuration requires that any request to endpoints under /stocks/** must be authenticated. Finally, it configures the application as an OAuth2 resource server using JWT tokens (oauth2ResourceServer().jwt()), ensuring that only requests with valid JWTs can access the secured stock endpoints. To enable your MCP server to authenticate and authorize clients using OAuth2, you need to configure a client in application.properties. This configuration registers a client with the authorization server, specifying the client ID, secret, authentication method, and allowed grant types. With this configuration, your MCP server can request JWT tokens from the authorization server and include them in requests to secured endpoints. This setup ensures that only authorized clients can access your stock data API. For this tutorial, we will use Keycloak as the authorization server to register the client. The focus is on the MCP server, so Keycloak setup is not covered here. Note: Before configuring the OAuth2 client, you need to register your MCP server as a client in Keycloak. Create a new client, set the client ID (e.g., stocks-client), configure the client secret, and enable the client_credentials grant type. This allows your MCP server to obtain access tokens to secure its endpoints. After adding the dependencies, creating the controller, and configuring security, you can run your MCP server as a standard Spring Boot application. Use your IDE or execute mvn spring-boot:run from the command line in the project directory. Once the application starts, it will listen on the default port 8080. Obtain an access token using the client_credentials grant: Use the token to query stock information. Please note localhost:8080 will act as the mcp.example.com. The server will return a JSON response like: Unauthorized requests will be rejected with a 401 error. This setup ensures that only authenticated clients can access stock data, making the MCP server production-ready and secure. We created a Stocks Info MCP Server with Spring AI and secured it using OAuth2. The server returns stock data only to authorized clients, ensuring secure access while keeping the setup simple and easy to use. We will contact you soon. Δ Δ This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Yet, according to experts, this revolutionary potential raises profound concerns, from surgical risks and device failures to deeper ethical questions about identity, autonomy, data ownership, algorithmic bias, and accessibility. In August, Noland Arbaugh, the first recipient of a Neuralink brain implant, revealed the technology had transformed his life 18 months after surgery. Arbaugh was left paralysed below the shoulders following a swimming accident that dislocated two vertebrae, and underwent the procedure in 2024. The Neuralink chip in his brain connects over 1,000 electrodes to his neurons, reads and decodes his brain’s electrical signals, translating them into digital commands. Dr Anusheel Munshi, MD (PGI Chandigarh), DNB(Gold Medal), MNAMS, Principal Director and Head, Radiation Oncology, BLK MAX Hospital, New Delhi, explained that these devices can connect computers to brains and hold transformative potential for medicine, promising breakthroughs in treating neurological disorders like paralysis, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s. By enabling direct communication between the brain and machines, they could restore lost functions and revolutionise neuroprosthetics. These devices can potentially increase human memory and intelligence by a quantum leap. “Neuralink’s claims are ambitious and increasingly realisable, being grounded in credible neuroscience research for decades, but far from being comprehensive. The company’s ‘Telepathy’ implant has already enabled participants to control computers and smartphones purely by thought. These are not just proof-of-concept demonstrations; patients like Arbaugh are reporting sustained, meaningful improvements in quality of life over many months,” Lakshay Sahni, the co-founder & CTO, Marbles Health, said. He continued that the human brain is too intricate for a “one-interface-fits-all” solution. While the technology can be revolutionary for conditions such as paralysis or locked-in syndrome, in disorders like depression, anxiety, addiction, and Alzheimer’s, the evidence remains speculative. With risk inherent in every neurosurgical implant, infection, scar tissue (gliosis), device malfunction, and the need for replacement surgeries are genuine medical concerns. Psychological risks include the possibility of a permanent brain implant altering a person’s sense of self or identity. Other ethical questions include algorithmic bias in decision-making, shared accountability for interventions, equitable access to such life-changing tools, and the long-term implications for human identity and autonomy. Alongside, non-invasive brain technologies are already available to several patients. The FDA has approved Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat depression, whereas transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) devices have been approved in India for various neuropsychiatric disorders. None of the methods requires surgery and can be safely offered in outpatient clinics, and in some cases, even at home. In India, several startups have efforts focused on non-invasive BCIs. Marbles Health is a medically approved startup for portable neuromodulation for psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and ADHD. These technologies are safer, more affordable, and scalable within the Indian healthcare system. Sid Das, the co-founder of eGenome, an AI-powered platform for analysing genomic data, shared that non-intrusive, AI-driven technologies like its own eGenome.ai can already reverse up to 99% of disorders by decoding biomarkers, predicting risks early, and guiding precision interventions tailored to each individual. “Unlike surgical interfaces, they are safer, scalable, and accessible, allowing for broad adoption without exposing patients to unnecessary risks. In cases where non-intrusive methods may not suffice, brain-computer interfaces such as Neuralink can still hold promise at the margins. But our priority is harnessing non-invasive, precision AI diagnostics to deliver personalised care at scale, striving for 100% curability,” he said. Alongside, Neuralink-related surgeries are a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars endeavour, and only a few in the U.S. currently have access to the technology. The timeline from discovery to an accessible standard of care is lengthy, and equitable access will likely pose an obstacle. On the other hand, non-invasive brain health devices that are portable, clinic-ready, and safe will remain the opening to accessibility for the next decade. The technology is still expensive and limited even in the U.S., so widespread adoption in India will take time. “Building another Neuralink in India faces hurdles like cost, infrastructure, investment, regulatory, talent gaps, and patient acceptance. While India is unlikely to see a “copycat Neuralink” soon, maybe it should not. The country is positioned to lead in scalable, non-invasive brain health technologies that can reach millions. Instead of replicating Neuralink’s invasive path, India’s opportunity may be to complement it, developing accessible, approved, non-invasive neurotech solutions,” the Marbles Health co-founder said.

Nvidia's earnings report is here — but clarity on its future chip sales in China isn't. Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05. Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company. Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region. Nvidia is ready to ship between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, the CFO added. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she said. Nvidia provided a revenue range for the current quarter of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion, compared to expectations of $53.46 billion. While the revenue forecast may seem in line, some analysts had put the figure closer to $60 billion. Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he said. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong. "Everything's sold out," he said. Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. The stock's year-to-date gain was 35% at market close. Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play. In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid. "Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. "Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out." Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note. "The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another robust quarter after the bell beating the Street estimates on the top and bottom-lines again while providing stronger guidance than Street expectations," he wrote. On China, Ives wrote that Nvidia beat revenue expectations despite a $4 billion decline in China H20 sales. The company also has supplies ready to be shipped when the geopolitical situation clears up. "This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China," Ives wrote. David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the "AI platform the world's been waiting for." He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is "ramping at full speed." Eventually, he said Nvidia will need to build two factories, one for the machines and another for robotic AI. Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024. Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that "everything's sold out," including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips. He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals. Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on "annual rhythm," but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026. "Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now," Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. He says the chipmaker is talking to the administration about "the importance of American companies" getting access to China's market. Earlier in the call, Kress said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chip sales to China. Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he says. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI. "Where chatbots used to be one-shot, you give it a prompt, and it would generate the answer," Huang says. "Now, the AI does research, it thinks, it does a plan, and it might use tools." Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be "a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more." As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year. "And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously," he says. "The amount of hallucination has dropped significantly." Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks for the first time on the call. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.) Nvidia's gaming revenue reached a record $4.3 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase, Kress says. While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell. Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion. CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks. She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia is excluding China's H20 revenue from its Q3 outlook while Nvidia continues to work through geopolitical issues. A key update: If restrictions ease, the CFO estimates $2 to $5 billion in H20 sales could flow in the third quarter. Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030. "The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia," she says. CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which begins with the executives reading prepared remarks. Afterward, the executives will field questions from analysts. "Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around," wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. "Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat." "And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop," he added. In a sign of its financial strength, Nvidia says its board approved $60 billion in share repurchases on Tuesday. That's the company's largest repurchase to date, topping the $50 billion it authorized last year. It also ranks among the biggest in US history — Apple holds the record with a $110 billion announcement in 2024. Share repurchases let companies buy back their own stock, reducing the number of shares on the market. That can boost earnings per share and often lifts a company's stock price — a win for investors. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D. Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business. For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance. It did, however, still sell some H20 chips outside of the region in the current quarter. "In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted customer outside of China," the company said. "There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter." CEO Jensen Huang or CFO Colette Kress may go into greater detail on H20 on the 5 p.m. ET analyst call. Revenue: $46.74 billion, +56% y/y, estimate $46.23 billion (Bloomberg Consensus) Source: Bloomberg The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high. The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs. All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants. Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending. William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. By 2028, the firm expects that to grow to $503 billion. — Brent D. Griffiths Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China. Nvidia is working on a chip would be more powerful than the H20 to sell to China, according to a recent Reuters report. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology. — Ana Altchek Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings. Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. If the chipmaker shows signs of slowing, it could also dial up the bubble talk even further. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth. During a dinner with reporters, Altman compared the current situation to the dot-com era. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, roughly $5 trillion in market cap was wiped out. Some companies, including WorldCom and Pets.com, never returned. Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology. — Brent D. Griffiths In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports. The kingdom has poured billions into Humain, which is building some of the world's largest data centers. CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access. Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. They've already sold out of capacity, in another sign of massive global demand for AI chips. The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported. — Charles Rollet President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. The reversal reportedly came with an agreement for the US government to get a 15% cut of the revenue from H20 sales to the region. Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though. Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Despite the deal with the Trump administration to resume selling its H20 chips to China, the Chinese government gave a directive to local tech companies to stop buying the GPUs due to security concerns, the report said. Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions. — Ana Altchek Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Now, the rival chipmaker has the US government in its corner. Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips. "They are going to put us out of business," Huang said, according to the book. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel." Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline. Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call. — Brent D. Griffiths Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note. Nvidia is also readying to release its GB300 AI chip, which could launch as soon as late September. "The AI GPU competitive landscape remains very favorable to Nvidia for the second half as well as next year," the firm wrote in a note on Monday. Baird reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $225 from $195 a share, implying 25% upside. In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference. The CEO said Nvidia would be increasing its supply chain in the US and "building it here on shore." While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress. — Ana Altchek Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter. The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending. This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries," the bank said in a note to clients on Monday. Analysts reiterated their "overweight" rating on the stock. Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon reported record profit in the first half of the year, with revenue reaching $402 million. Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. — Ana Altchek Analysts at Stifel said they expected Nvidia to beat earnings estimates for the quarter and post "healthy" guidance for the third quarter, thanks to strong demand for its chips. "The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote. They continued: "As it stands today, we lean more toward the bull case, while underscoring that supply-side risk (including tariffs and trade regulations) is the key overhang to the name." Analysts reiterated their "Buy" rating on the stock and raised their price target to $212 from the prior $202, implying 18% upside. Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises." Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models. "NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. At the time analysts wrote the note, Nvidia made up around 8% of the benchmark index. Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels. Second quarter Revenue estimate: $46.23 billion Third quarter Full year 2026 Source: Bloomberg Correction, Wednesday, August 27 — An earlier version of this post incorrectly presented previous remarks from Nvidia's Q1 analyst call as being said on the Q2 call — those quotes have been removed.

Organizations are prioritizing seamless, user-friendly digital environments to boost employee engagement, productivity, and satisfaction. Businesses are increasingly moving away from legacy systems to cloud-based workplace models that support hybrid work, enable real-time collaboration, and simplify IT service delivery. Companies are also deploying AI-powered service desks and automation to reduce response times and improve support efficiency, making the workplace more responsive and employee-focused. Trend: AI-driven Employee Experience Platforms AI-driven employee experience platforms are reshaping how organizations support their workforce by delivering personalized, intelligent services. Infosys, through its Infosys Wingspan platform, leverages AI to provide customized learning paths, foster collaboration, and offer performance insights tailored to employee roles and goals. TCS has developed Ignio, an AI-led cognitive automation solution that helps streamline employee services, from IT support to HR workflows. These platforms analyze behavioral data to recommend actions that improve productivity and well-being. For instance, Infosys uses AI-powered tools to proactively address employee concerns, enhancing satisfaction and retention. This reflects a growing shift toward intelligent, experience-centric workplace services. Digital workplace market in the US The digital workplace market in the US is evolving rapidly as enterprises shift toward hybrid work models and cloud-first strategies. Large organizations across industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing are investing in digital workplace services to enhance collaboration, streamline IT support, and improve employee engagement. In May 2024, TCS expanded its Smart Workplace offerings for US clients, integrating AI-driven service desks and personalized digital experience monitoring. Infosys has also deepened its presence in the US through localized digital transformation hubs, helping enterprises modernize employee services using cloud and analytics. Enterprises are increasingly focusing on experience-level agreements (XLAs) rather than traditional service-level agreements (SLAs), emphasizing employee satisfaction and productivity. The growing demand for seamless digital onboarding, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and enterprise mobility is pushing service providers to deliver more tailored and responsive workplace solutions. This transformation reflects how US businesses are rethinking workforce enablement and digital service delivery. By organization size, the SMEs segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have become the most active consumers of digital workplace services as they require scalable and economically viable services to support the dynamic business requirements. SMEs do not have as many legacy systems as large enterprises, so they can be more responsive to cloud-based digital workplace tools. Remote collaboration, endpoint management, and security without the burden of operating complex in-house IT systems are becoming top priorities for these organizations. The SMEs are being pursued by vendors with streamlined service packages that encompass a unified communication platform, device provisioning, support services, and employee experience tools, and they are provided as managed services. It is attractive because of predictable pricing, rapid implementation, and the ability to scale services as business needs increase or workforce models change. Providers who provide localized services and industry-specific customization are also valued by SMEs, particularly within retail, professional services, and education markets. With digital workplace solutions becoming increasingly modular and service-driven, SMEs enjoy the same functionality previously available to large enterprises, including automated help desks, monitoring on experience levels, and cloud desktops. Inquire Before Buying: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=81457101 By vertical, the BFSI segment is estimated to have the largest market share during the global forecast. The BFSI sector leads the digital workplace services market due to its focus on modernization, security, and employee-centric transformation. In April 2024, Wipro implemented an AI-powered digital workplace platform for Allianz, a leading European insurance company, automating over 60% of IT helpdesk interactions and streamlining service delivery. Cognizant partnered with BlackRock in June 2024 to deploy a cloud-native virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and intelligent automation, enhancing secure remote access for investment teams across regions. IBM collaborated with BNP Paribas in January 2025 to implement its digital workplace framework integrated with Watson AI, significantly reducing incident resolution times and delivering predictive insights on IT asset utilization. These examples show how BFSI firms are actively investing in scalable and intelligent digital workplace ecosystems to support remote operations, maintain compliance, and boost workforce efficiency. Opportunity: Integration with digital twin and IoT technologies The integration of digital twin and IoT technologies presents a significant opportunity in the digital workplace services market, particularly for industries seeking real-time operational insights. In March 2025, TCS collaborated with Siemens to implement a digital workplace solution integrated with digital twin models for a major European automotive manufacturer. This enabled remote monitoring of production lines and predictive maintenance using IoT sensor data. Infosys, in partnership with PTC, deployed an IoT-enabled smart workplace solution in January 2024 for a global energy enterprise, connecting employee devices with industrial assets to improve workspace efficiency and safety. HCLTech has also partnered with IBM to offer digital twin-powered workplace solutions that simulate facility usage and support proactive infrastructure management. These collaborations demonstrate how technology and service providers are combining strengths to build intelligent workplace environments that are more adaptive, predictive, and efficient, marking a shift toward experiential and insight-driven employee ecosystems.

Title: RKLB Stock To $85?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) has shown exceptional growth in 2025, with its stock climbing nearly 90% year-to-date. This surge has been driven by the company’s recent successful rocket launches and its ability to secure major new contracts, particularly related to its upcoming Neutron rocket program. But what could drive another sharp rally from current levels to targets above $85? The following analysis explores the main factors that could fuel such significant upside over the next three years. That said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than holding a single stock, take a look at the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has generated returns of more than 91% since inception. Separately, see – UNH Stock To $600? Rocket Lab’s revenue outlook points to substantial expansion. With last-twelve-month revenues of $504 million, the company could more than double its revenue base to around $1.2 billion by 2027. This growth is supported by several drivers: Rocket Lab’s valuation multiple highlights its trajectory. Trading at nearly 50 times trailing revenues, RKLB reflects the premium placed on high-growth space companies. Yet, multiple compression suggests strong upside: If revenues double in three years while the stock price holds steady, the revenue multiple would fall to 25x. Given the company’s growth and positioning, a more realistic scenario is a multiple near 35x by 2027. At that multiple applied to expected 2027 revenues above $1.2 billion, the implied share price is about $85—nearly 80% higher than today. This reflects Rocket Lab’s growth story and the valuation premium typically afforded to leading space firms. Several catalysts could accelerate Rocket Lab’s trajectory: Potential challenges could slow this trajectory: This analysis outlines an upside case for Rocket Lab based on its growth and positioning. While a move to $85+ offers attractive potential, investors must weigh these gains against real risks. The 2022 correction, when RKLB lost 83% of its value, underscored the volatility inherent in space investments. This bullish case depends on successful execution in Neutron development, contract wins, and global expansion. Investors should size positions carefully, recognizing both the large upside and the risks tied to this high-growth sector. As always, investing in just one or a few stocks carries risk. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, a diversified collection of 30 stocks that has consistently beaten the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? Because HQ Portfolio stocks deliver stronger returns with less risk, offering smoother performance, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. This reinforces the value of diversification, particularly when considering high-growth but volatile names like RKLB.

A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton’s Shimon Kogan unpacks the behavioral and economic dynamics behind token value, investor psychology, and the rise of meme coins in this special series on the “Future of Finance.” Itay Goldstein Itay Goldstein Listen to the podcast. What determines whether a cryptocurrency succeeds or fades into obscurity? In this episode, Wharton professor Itay Goldstein speaks with Shimon Kogan, adjunct associate professor of finance at Wharton and longtime instructor of Wharton’s fintech course, to explore the economic and behavioral forces behind token success. From network effects and user adoption to coordination challenges and the phenomenon of meme coins, this conversation dives into the mechanics of tokenomics and what drives value in the world of fintech. This discussion is part of a special series called “Future of Finance: The Rise of Crypto and Digital Money.” Listen to this episode on Spotify or Apple Podcasts. Itay Goldstein: Welcome everyone. This is the Future of Finance series. This is our second season, and we are talking about digital assets, cryptocurrencies, tokens, decentralized finance, and everything related to that space. I am Itay Goldstein, professor of finance here at Wharton, and I’m currently the chair of the finance department. We are going to devote this episode to thinking about the economics of tokenization. This is a term that is now known as tokenomics. We’re going to try to understand what are the fundamental forces that are driving the market for tokens and coins, and how these forces are different from some of the other markets, financial assets that we are used to and that we have been thinking about in the past. I have the perfect guest today to think about those issues. Shimon Kogan has been with us at Wharton for the last 10 years or so, teaching the fintech course. He was one of the first movers into the area of fintech when few places had fintech courses. He already designed one and came to teach it for us, and has been doing it since then with great success. He also worked on related issues in his own research, and we are going to talk about that as well. Welcome Shimon. It’s great to have you. Let’s dive right in and try to understand some of the terms that we are talking about. Can you help us understand, what do we think about when we think about tokens and coins? What are the common uses for them? How are they potentially going to change the financial system? A lot of it is maybe just a pipe dream, things that we are aspiring to but have not been realized yet. How much is real and how much is still just a fantasy? Shimon Kogan: I’ll try to deliver on that, at least at a high level, because I’m sure that we’re going to dive into some of the more specifics during the conversation. But the top is a good place to start because there are lots of terms in this field and it gets quite confusing. In the world of crypto, I think it’s important to distinguish between different class of assets, because it tells you something about the underlying technology and the underlying structure. At the core level, we have cryptocurrencies. And each of these cryptocurrencies is associated with a particular blockchain. [For example,] bitcoin is the blockchain protocol. BTC is the native currency for that. Here as well, I think it’s helpful to distinguish between transactional only blockchains like bitcoin or litecoin, where the primary use case of the coin, aside for paying for the security, but the primary use case in these kinds of blockchains is payments. We want to separate that from the second generation, if you will, of blockchains, and those are programmable blockchains like ethereum, solana, and many other competitors where the primary use case of the native digital coin is to pay for the execution of smart contracts. So, we have cryptocurrencies as the main type of asset. Now, notice that when we talk about cryptocurrencies, because each of them is native to its own blockchain, you cannot take bitcoin and transact in ethereum and vice versa without some third-party offering, kind of like bridge services. We can talk about that if you’re interested. Now, on programmable blockchains, there are lots of things you can do. As it turns out, you can create tokens. We want to distinguish between, again, the cryptocurrency like ethereum and tokens that live on ethereum. These are assets that are created by applications around various use cases. Some of them could be payments for services, could be voting, could be control. We’ll come back to when we talk about tokenomics. The fact that this sort of Turing complete programming language means that you can create lots and lots of different varieties of contracts, and we see that in practice. That also introduces vulnerability. Many of my examples are going to be from ethereum because it’s simply the largest programmable blockchain. They created templates of types of tokens just to make developer’s life easier, so you don’t have to figure out from scratch all the features and open yourself up to security vulnerabilities. You may be familiar with ERC-20, which is the fungible token standard that was behind the ICO boom, or heavily used during the ICO boom. We have ERC-721 tokens. That’s the template oftentimes used in nonfungible tokens. More recently, we have ERC-1400, which now advances as a format to offer tokenization of off-chain assets. Again, we have cryptocurrencies and we have tokens. Now, those tokens inherent the security of the blockchain on which they were developed. So as a developer, you have to ask yourself where you want to develop your application and where these tokens are going to live. Because, again, they don’t port from one protocol to another. Naturally, there’s a lot of competition around kind of eyeballs and attention of developers by these, what we call layer ones, by these programmable blockchains. Goldstein: But if you want to think about the main economic uses for them, how would you classify that? Kogan: The first is, and that’s a very specific type of token, but it’s so specific that has its own name, and those are stablecoins, right? Stablecoins are tokens that are designed to keep a peg to, typically, the U.S. dollar, but could be, in principle, anything. It’s a big business. Circle went public, went from like $30 to $200 overnight. It’s a real big business. There’s another big business around and some real traction around tokenization, because that’s the idea of representing non-crypto native assets on crypto infrastructure, blockchain infrastructure. BlackRock, for example, partnered with Securitize to offer its money market fund, Biddle. That was the relative success. Goldstein: What you’re saying is taking financial assets and putting them on token. What is the advantage of doing that? Kogan: There could be few advantages. First of all, what you get is instantaneous settlement. Even if you’re an institutional player, once you have stablecoins and you have these crypto-native securities, or representation of them, then you have 24/7 instantaneous settlement, which we still don’t have even if you’re a large sort of corporation. If you’re moving money about a settlement, it takes time, depending on what kind of asset you’re looking at. But obviously, the ambition is much bigger than that. RobinHood announced that they’re going to offer tokens associated with private equity. So, they’re going to take, I don’t know, SpaceX, and OpenAI, etc., and represent them as tokens. People are talking about what’s called tokenizing real-world assets. Those are not securities at all. This could be anything from collectibles to real estate. Goldstein: It allows us to trade on things that otherwise we wouldn’t be able to trade. And things that we could trade, it allows us to do it more efficiently? Kogan: That’s right. Look, this is not a [panacea]. I have a lot of conversations with people in the industry about this. I think [there are] the parts of it that makes sense, [and] the parts of it that people are not thinking carefully through. Like, for example, there are fundamental reasons why some of these assets are illiquid. That illiquidity I don’t think is going to go away by creating a digital representation and offering people to trade it 24/7. That’s not a solution to the fundamental problem that causes these assets to be non-tradable. I’ll take the other side of this, but you can take assets that have a fairly infrequent price discovery, and you’re still not going to solve the problem of that price being stale. Again, this is not a fiction, this is happening. You can allow owners of these assets to pledge them as collateral, and that could be a partial solution for the liquidity problem. I have an asset that you have a hard time valuing, and you’re saying, “Look, I don’t know if it’s worth $80 or $90 or $100, but the probability that it’s worth less than $20 is very low. If you lock this asset in a smart contract, I’ll lend you $20 against this, with appropriate interest.” I think it’s an interesting solution of — kind of indirect way of giving some liquidity and by making these assets, at the very least, legible. Goldstein: When we are thinking about tokenomics, the economics of tokens, we would like to understand supply, demand, how prices are formed. If we are thinking about other financial assets, like stocks, I think we have very well-established frameworks. You’re thinking about future earnings, future cash flows, you’re discounting them, and so on. Those rules are not working exactly like that when it comes to tokens, and this is what makes the economics a little richer and more interesting. What do you think are the other forces, and how should we think about the economics here? Kogan: It’s a good question. First of all, let me say that it should be obvious from our channel so far that this flexibility allows us to create all sorts of tokens with lots of different features. I think one of the challenges of this industry is that there’s very little theory and not that much of an empirical work from academia to guide, say, new platform builders for how do their structure. They often come and ask these questions like, “How should I control supply? What is the emission rate, burn rate?” Basically, the dimensions along which they have choices are quite broad. I think that there’s more that we don’t understand about optimal contract design, if you will, in the context of tokenomics than we do. That’s my personal opinion on this. Now, I think it’s helpful to draw parallels to equities. There are some similarities and some differences. They look a little bit like each other because both, under some circumstances, give you some control rights and ownership rights, and some of them, although they don’t declare that, give you some cash flow rights. But let’s understand what world each of these live in. In the world of securities or equities, essentially what you have is a legal structure that safeguards the holders of securities against exposed bad behavior by managers or controls. Obviously, you do not have that legal protection when it comes to tokens, at least not under the current legal framework. What you do have with tokens is the ability to what we call pre-commit. What you can do, for example, with tokens, that you cannot do with equities, is to say, “I’m going to program in the rate by which new tokens are going to be issued, and it’s going to be a function of these conditions.” Take bitcoin, for example. It’s purely a condition. Like, it’s function of time, right? The price of bitcoin doesn’t affect the mission of bitcoin, how many miners there are. They don’t matter. That’s a particular choice that you can do in crypto world that you cannot easily implement with equities. Goldstein: This leads me to something related that people would think maybe is on the fringe but is getting a lot of attention, which is meme coins. You have coins that are kind of based on nothing. If you think about dogecoin or shiba inu, others, you basically have a token that has value just because other people think it has value and not because it represents anything that is underlying it that would be valuable. Would you think about that also using the same framework, or do you think this is something completely different? Kogan: I think that’s a good question. If you want to be provocative, you can ask whether bitcoin is a meme coin as well, right? Goldstein: Do you think that bitcoin is a meme coin? Kogan: No, I personally don’t, but — Goldstein: No, because at least with bitcoin, at the beginning, there was this idea that it’s going to be a new currency people are going to use it to buy things, and so on. I don’t think it really panned out this way so far, but there were some use cases. Kogan: Absolutely. I’m not suggesting that bitcoin is meme coin. All I’m saying is that if you take a few steps back and look from high-level perspective, you can ask yourself, what is the tangible utility? You’re absolutely right. By the way, with some of the meme coins, the process was kind of fake-it-until-you-make-it, in some sense. I don’t think it was designed. But, dogecoin now, Elon Musk is suggesting that it’s going to be the payment rail maybe for X. You have now kind of a mini-ecosystem around shiba inu. Again, I don’t think it was there in the first place. And I do think that there’s a lot of other factors at play here that are more coming from behavioral finance than anything else, in terms of thinking about valuation. I do want to mention something that we found, that I think is relevant for this discussion, in a paper where we had access to a really interesting dataset from eToro. EToro is a publicly traded company. It’s basically a retail broker that has operations in over 100 markets. One of the neat features of eToro is that from the get-go they offered retail investors the ability to invest in lots of different types of assets. They were one of the first to actually embrace crypto. The question we asked was really simple. Do people seem to behave different in cryptos than in, say, equities or gold? We wanted to ask that very simple question. More specifically, what we’re interested in is how expectations of future returns of these asset classes actually respond to prices, which is kind of what you’re getting at, right? Under some assumptions, what we can do is back out the share in the portfolio for users dedicated to each of these asset classes, and you can estimate how these portfolio shares respond to past returns. Very robust finding, right? Lots of different specifications. We find that when you look at equities and people have retail investors, in our sample, have contrarian beliefs. Equity prices go up, people believe that future returns are going to be lower than they were before. By the way, that’s true for gold as well, but not for crypto. So, they appear to have kind of momentum, like beliefs in crypto, and we try to understand where it’s coming from. For example, we looked at whether people have momentum beliefs when you focus on lottery-like stocks, those are stocks that have positive skewness. Maybe young stocks, smaller ones. There are various known proxies for this. And interestingly, we don’t find that. We still find contrarian beliefs, even in these lottery-like stocks. So, there’s something specific about crypto. Goldstein: This is the role of adoption and coordination, I think. This speaks very clearly to that. You say this can also support meme coins that might not have any underlying value, but the value is just coming from the fact that others are using it? Kogan: That’s true, although I think that with meme coins it’s a very extreme case because there’s not even a pretense. I think it’s for regulatory reasons, right? Part of it, I think, started as a way of avoiding being classified as a security. There’s no pretense of anything underpinning its value. It’s a very kind of extreme case of not where we push fundamentals to the future, where we have no fundamentals at all. There are some really interesting studies done in the ‘70s and ’80s looking at experimental markets where they tried to do this. They tried to see what happens when you push fundamentals further out into the future, and they found two things that could be actually relevant for these markets. They found that, first of all, you can create these bubbles in a lab, in a very controlled, very simple environment, in a reputable way. They found that expectations are adaptive. When these bubbles happen and you ask traders what they think the price is going to happen, many of them understand that prices get detached from fundamentals. But these fundamentals are not going to show up until later in the future, so they exhibit these adaptive expectations. The second thing is that they underestimate how quickly the bubble will burst, on average. Because it’s clear that, because there’s something anchoring prices. Goldstein: There is some parallel also to meme stocks, right? In the previous season, I talked to Matt Levine about meme stocks and social behavior in the financial market, and clearly that is a very strong force here as well. Maybe even more extreme, because with meme stocks, there is a grain of fundamental, whereas here there isn’t. These are maybe the same underlying forces, bit even more extreme that we see them here in tokenomics. Kogan: I agree. With GameStop, AMC, you would think that at some point there are fundamentals that are going to anchor the price of a stock with meme coins. It’s not obvious what that anchor is. I think they really lean on similar drivers for users, this sense of community, shared narrative, in some cases, this idea that they are collectively rebelling against traditional powers. I think that’s very important to note as well, and we see this elsewhere. There’s a great appetite for gambling. Goldstein: I want to go back a little bit to ICO, initial coin offerings. A few years ago, there was a wave of ICOs, and I think at that point there was hope that there is real economic value behind it. Because those are firms that, instead of issuing equity, they are issuing coins, and that is a way to raise capital and also supports the products of the firms. But unfortunately, there was also a lot of fraud associated with that, and then it came to halt. Now, there’s a lot of regulatory uncertainty where it’s going to go. Where do you think we are headed with that? You think there is still a future for this? Kogan: I very much agree with your assessment, but I also want to point out that there are some legitimate platforms that were built around that. Goldstein: Yeah, absolutely. There were some of them that were certainly legitimate, but there was also a lot of fraudulent ones around them. And the fact that it was hard to tell which is which, I think this is what caused the crash in activity. Kogan: I agree. It was sort of combination of that. And it kind of coincided, roughly around the same time, with the Terra Luna debacle, the FTX, Celsius. There are a bunch of notable cases of what you would legally or otherwise probably classify as fraud. That led to an obvious response by the regulator, the SEC. I think the regulatory environment now looks very different in the U.S., and I think that’s worth mentioning, and I think there’s hope that under that new framework there will be ways in which you can actually do this with proper disclosure and guidelines and consumer protection. That’s what we’re concerned about. The audience may be familiar with the GENIUS Act, which is standing for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoin Act. It’s basically a framework for, how do you issue payment stablecoins, etc.? Again, I’m happy to talk more about that if you’re interested. And there’s another, even more ambitious and broader attempt to clarify what is a security, what is a commodity — under the Clarity Act — and provide safe harbor to developers, and establish market rules, and compliance rules, etc. These two may get combined eventually, and that’s part of the political discussion that’s taking place right now. We see very different frameworks slightly, but we see Europe being a bit ahead of the U.S. in that way through MiCA framework. It doesn’t cover everything, but it’s quite comprehensive and talks about guidelines for how you issue tokens and stable coins, and what custody services look like, etc. I think that, yes, in the U.S. — I think everywhere, right? We’ve seen some regulatory lag, because the industry moves very, very quickly. It’s fascinating to see how quickly the evolution cycles in this industry are. There are some legitimate issues around that, or concerns around regulatory capture and regulatory arbitrage. I work as an expert witness for a number of crypto-related cases, and I see how the level of understanding on the supervisory and regulatory side, it’s very different from what it was a few years ago. There’s catching up to do, but I’m hopeful that it’s happening, and I think that this can actually lead to, at least from an entrepreneur’s perspective, a more sensible framework that’s based on activity and not based on type of institution.

Title: Can ADA rally to $1.20 despite SEC’s latest Cardano ETF delay?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/can-ada-rally-to-1-20-despite-secs-latest-cardano-etf-delay/
Time Published: 2025-08-26T13:00:19Z
Full Content:
Will Cardano, XRP, and PENGU ETFs finally break through, or stay trapped in regulatory limbo? The SEC has postponed its review of the Cardano ETF until the 26th of October, extending delays on multiple altcoin products. ADA, XRP, and PENGU continue to feel the pressure of regulatory delays. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again paused its review of the proposed Cardano [ADA] exchange-traded fund (ETF). It extended the decision deadline from the 27th of August to the 26th of October 2025. The move adds Cardano to the growing roster of altcoin ETF applications facing regulatory delays, as the agency continues to take a cautious approach toward approving new crypto investment products. If approved, the Cardano ETF would allow investors to access ADA through a regulated vehicle, eliminating the need to hold the cryptocurrency directly. The SEC’s latest delay has fueled speculation about how an eventual approval or denial could shape Cardano’s market trajectory. In fact, BlackRock has not yet sought a Cardano ETF; its existing Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] products have already attracted billions in inflows and lifted market prices. If BlackRock pursued an ADA-backed product, the token could rally toward $1.20, based on Fibonacci extension levels. For Cardano, the outcome of this review carried significant weight. A greenlight would mark a major step in boosting ADA’s accessibility for mainstream investors through traditional brokerages. On top of that, growing institutional recognition is already evident, with Cardano recently climbing in Grayscale’s asset rankings. By contrast, a rejection would be a setback for Grayscale and other firms seeking regulated exposure to the cryptocurrency. The SEC emphasized that the extension is intended to provide more time for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposal, echoing its cautious stance toward other crypto-related applications. Needless to say, this is not an isolated case. Alongside Cardano, the regulator has also delayed its decisions on the Canary PENGU and WisdomTree Ripple [XRP] ETFs, both of which are now slated for a ruling by the 12th of October. By then, the SEC must either approve, reject, or initiate formal disapproval proceedings. The ripple effects of the SEC’s cautious stance are already being felt in the market. ADA slipped 5.15% to $0.8389, XRP dropped 1.73% to $2.91, and PENGU fell 5.59% to $0.03054 over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Ripple’s August 2025 legal win cleared the way for new spot ETF filings from Grayscale and Franklin Templeton. Still, the path forward remained uncertain. Under new SEC Chair Paul Atkins, and with crypto laws on the horizon, optimism for approval rose. Yet risks remained.

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in IRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs post $219 million rebound while Ethereum funds attract twice the inflows

Fidelity and BlackRock drive $219 million rebound for Bitcoin ETFs, but Ethereum continues to shine. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States ended a difficult run of redemptions with their first day of inflows in more than a week. According to Coinperps data, the products collectively drew $219 million on Aug. 25, marking a shift in investor sentiment after six consecutive trading sessions of withdrawals. This rebound was led by Fidelity, BlackRock, and Ark 21Shares, which each attracted over $60 million. Fidelity’s FBTC logged the largest daily intake at $65.6 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $63.4 million and Ark’s ARKB with $61.2 million. Smaller allocations flowed into Bitwise’s BITB ($15.2 million), Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ($7.3 million), and VanEck’s HODL ($6.3 million). Meanwhile, ETFs offered by Invesco, Valkyrie, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton registered no new capital on the day. The return of positive flows comes after a bruising stretch in mid-August. Between Aug. 15 and Aug. 22, the group of funds shed roughly $1.2 billion, reflecting a wave of profit-taking and caution among institutional holders. So, this reversal suggests that some investors are seeing renewed opportunity in Bitcoin despite its recent loss of momentum. Meanwhile, Ethereum products continued to overshadow Bitcoin ETFs in terms of investor demand. On the same day, spot Ethereum ETFs attracted $443.9 million in net inflows, more than double their BTC counterparts’ total. BlackRock’s ETHA dominated with $314.9 million, while Fidelity’s FETH drew $87.4 million. Smaller contributions came from Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust and offerings by Bitwise, 21Shares, and Invesco, adding about $17 million together. The strong showing follows a turbulent prior week when Ethereum ETFs saw outflows equivalent to 105,000 ETH, breaking a multi-week streak of steady demand. Glassnode data indicates that the tide has turned again, with institutions adding back 16,900 ETH at the start of this week. The split in flows highlights how investor positioning is evolving in the current market conditions. Bitcoin ETFs are showing early signs of stabilization after heavy redemptions, while Ethereum funds are attracting stronger conviction in the short term. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Reminds Investors of Novo, Altimmune, SelectQuote, and Spectrum that Lawsuits Have Been Filed and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm

August 26, 2025 08:11 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Aug. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Novo lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the SelectQuote lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SLQT Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI) Class Period: March 17, 2022 to September 22, 2022 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 24, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Spectrum’s Pinnacle Study of poziotinib for the treatment of lung cancer was less positive than it portrayed to investors. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

Title: Why Everyone Is Buying Bitcoin, And What You Need To Know
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/beccabratcher/2025/08/26/why-everyone-is-buying-bitcoin-and-what-you-need-to-know/

ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. Bitcoin’s appeal has shifted between speculation, ideology, and innovation. But in 2025, the reasons for owning the world’s first decentralized digital currency appear more rooted in macroeconomics and politics than ever before. Inflation data continues to plague households, job markets face an uncertain future shaped by AI’s rapid expansion, and a growing divide in perspectives over the U.S. dollar’s direction. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin’s narrative as “hard money” is becoming clear. This article examines three converging forces, persistent inflation, economic stagnation, and political uncertainty, that are driving renewed demand for Bitcoin. July 2025’s inflation report showed consumer prices landing just under the Federal Reserve’s target, despite the added pressure of tariffs. While the month’s figures suggest some progress, longer-term data show inflation trending higher over time. For households, that continued upward slope means costs for essentials such as groceries, energy, and housing remain elevated, underscoring the ongoing challenge for policymakers. For investors, inflation diminishes the purchasing power of traditional savings. Cash in the bank is worth less tomorrow than today. This reality has revived interest in scarce assets that can hold value over time. Historically, gold served this role, but Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins offers a modern alternative. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be expanded through central bank policy, Bitcoin’s issuance is predetermined by code. Economist Saifedean Ammous often describes this feature as “hard money.” A system resistant to inflationary debasement. Ammous argues that in an era of rising deficits, ballooning government spending, and a Federal Reserve still wielding extraordinary influence over markets, digital scarcity offers reassurance. Institutional adoption further supports this narrative. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, launched in the U.S. in 2024, have attracted billions in inflows, making it easier for retirement accounts, pensions, and retail investors alike to gain exposure. Another factor driving Bitcoin interest is less about money and more about work. 2025 labor-market data show slowing job creation, with wage growth struggling to keep pace with living costs. AI’s acceleration adds another layer of uncertainty. From automated call centers to AI-driven logistics, companies are investing heavily in efficiency. While AI adoption may boost productivity in the long run, it also raises questions about displacement and stagnant pay in the short term. The extent to which AI directly suppresses job growth is difficult to determine, but the perception of instability is real. This sense of economic unease has fueled interest in money perceived as both “hardest” and most accessible. Bitcoin, unlike stocks or bonds, does not require a brokerage account or financial advisor. It is open-source, borderless, and available to anyone with internet access. In uncertain times, accessibility matters. For younger generations, Bitcoin is not just an investment but a parallel system outside traditional financial gatekeepers. In a survey by Bank of America, people age 44 or younger consistently rank Bitcoin and other digital assets as preferred long-term holdings. The logic is straightforward. If the job market no longer guarantees stability, building resilience through alternative assets becomes a personal strategy. Politics can shape how economic challenges are perceived. President Donald Trump has repeatedly faulted the Federal Reserve for America’s financial strains, arguing that its interest rate policies have weakened confidence in the dollar. Against this backdrop, the divide is clear. some investors turn to Bitcoin as a hedge outside government control. Taken together, these forces, chronic inflation, job market anxiety, and political division, are creating momentum for Bitcoin. What was once a niche interest has entered mainstream financial conversations. ETF commercials run on prime-time television, professional athletes request salaries in Bitcoin, and major corporations continue to hold it on their balance sheets. However, Bitcoin’s volatility is not trivial. Prices continue to reach new highs, but can fall just as quickly. Investors must balance its potential as “hard money” with the reality that its market is still in infancy. Yet the trajectory of its adoption signals underlying strength. Each cycle of volatility brings new participants who hold through the turbulence, strengthening its base. As with gold in the 1970s or internet stocks in the 1990s, Bitcoin is moving from fringe asset to fixture in the global financial system. The question of why everyone is buying Bitcoin in 2025 has no single answer. It reflects a convergence of forces as inflation erodes savings, job stagnation challenges household stability, and political division raises doubts about the dollar’s future. For some, Bitcoin represents a hedge against inflation. For others, it is a tool of financial independence in an uncertain job market. And for many, it is an escape from political and institutional distrust. Together, these motivations create a powerful narrative of Bitcoin as hard money for uncertain times.

Title: OpenAI taps Instagram and Doximity execs to lead its next AI healthcare push
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-taps-doximity-cofounder-to-lead-its-next-healthcare-push-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-26T09:00:01Z

OpenAI is ramping up its push into healthcare with two high-profile new hires. The AI powerhouse has tapped Nate Gross, the cofounder and former chief strategy officer of Doximity, and Ashley Alexander, former co-head of product at Instagram, to lead the next phase of its healthcare business. Gross joined OpenAI in June, while Alexander assumed her role on Tuesday, according to their LinkedIn profiles. An OpenAI spokesperson said Gross will lead OpenAI's healthcare strategy, with early goals including co-creating new healthcare technologies with clinicians and researchers. Alexander will be a vice president of product in OpenAI's health business, building tech for individual consumers and clinicians, the spokesperson said. Until now, OpenAI has mostly powered other companies' products and partnered on medical AI research, rather than competing directly with its own healthcare tech. But the company has been telegraphing its expanding healthcare ambitions for months. CEO Sam Altman spotlighted ChatGPT's healthcare skills during the August launch of GPT-5, calling the model "a legitimate Ph.D. expert." "It can help you understand your healthcare and make decisions on your journey," Altman said, adding that GPT-5 performed "exceptionally well" on health-related questions. That performance was validated by HealthBench, OpenAI's first stand-alone healthcare tool, released in May. The open-source benchmark lets health systems, startups, and tech firms evaluate the accuracy and safety of health AI applications. OpenAI's healthcare ambitions reflect a larger pivot: OpenAI wants to own not just foundation models but also the infrastructure and AI applications built on top of them. In education, it launched Study Mode, a ChatGPT spinoff for students, in July to compete with Google's Gemini for Education. It demoed an AI sales agent in February, and rolled out an agentic tool that books reservations and shops for users in July. Healthcare AI is already crowded with tech giants. Palantir began developing AI for hospitals in 2021. Microsoft launched cloud-based clinician tools in 2020 and has since deepened ties with medical-records giant Epic to use AI in notetaking. Gross and Alexander's new roles at OpenAI aim to help the AI juggernaut pick up the pace. The OpenAI spokesperson said the company thinks "improving human health will be one of the defining impacts of AGI." Gross has deep roots in digital health. He cofounded Doximity 15 years ago as a "LinkedIn for doctors." In 2023, Doximity launched Doximity GPT, built on OpenAI tech, to help physicians with administrative tasks. So far this year, Doximity has acquired AI clinical evidence company Pathway Medical for $63 million and launched its own free AI scribe to compete with the likes of Microsoft and $5.3 billion startup Abridge. Doximity is one of the few healthcare companies that went public in 2021's IPO frenzy that isn't currently in the red. Despite significant share price fluctuations in the past four years, Doximity's stock is up over 60% above its opening price at IPO. Gross is also the cofounder of digital health investment and research firm Rock Health. Alexander worked at Meta for 12 years, 11 of which she spent on Instagram's product team, building out many of the app's features for advertising, creator monetization, and video content. OpenAI's health AI research to date has been spearheaded by Karan Singal, a former Google researcher who helped lead the development of the tech giant's medical LLM Med-PaLM. Singal will continue to run OpenAI's healthcare AI research, the OpenAI spokesperson said. OpenAI is hiring for at least two other roles in its health business. Its careers page lists openings for a health AI research scientist and a healthcare software engineer. Despite its plans to compete more directly with health startups, OpenAI isn't ditching its partnerships. The company most recently announced a collaboration with Kenyan primary care provider Penda Health in July to assess Penda Health's AI clinical copilot built on OpenAI's GPT-4o. It also continues to power the technology behind companies like pediatric care startup Summer Health and health insurtech Oscar Health. Jump to

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/25/2025 6:33:00 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Fox Business’s Larry Kudlow expressed concern on Friday over the Trump administration’s move to take a 10 percent stake in mega chipmaker Intel. “I am very, very uncomfortable with that idea. I’m very uncomfortable with that one, but that’s a conversation for another meal on another day,” Kudlow told economist Stephen Moore, in an interview highlighted by Mediate. Moore himself, a Trump economic adviser, earlier in the appearance, also criticized the administration’s decision, calling it “terrible.” “I hate corporate welfare. That’s privatization in reverse. We want the government to divest of assets, not buy assets. So terrible, one of the bad ideas that’s come out of this White House,” Moore told Kudlow, who served under President Trump as the director of the National Economic Council during his first term. Trump on Friday announced that the U.S. government now owns 10 percent of Intel shares. “The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL. Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” he wrote on social media. (Excerpt) Read more at thehill.com ...

Come for the politics, stay for the snark. by Anne Laurie| August 25, 20256:53 pm| 11 Comments This post is in: Excellent Links, Grifters Gonna Grift, Science & Technology, Trump Crime Cartel Palantir has been getting a huge number of deals like this, in what is extremely obviously self-dealing. [image or embed] — Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@reichlinmelnick.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 2:47 PM === I mean, when you wear the VP on your arm like the skin-puppet he is, why wouldn't you capitalize on that? — David (@dkboyd.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 3:27 PM I’ve been curious, and I thought y’all might be too. From Wired, “What Does Palantir Actually Do?”: Palantir is arguably one of the most notorious corporations in contemporary America. Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm’s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance. But a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it’s a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist… The problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It’s really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it’s hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?” Xia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is… Juan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS. Another former staffer says Palantir provides “really extravagant plumbing with data.” Xia calls Foundry, one of Palantir’s flagship software platforms, “a collection of different applications” that customers use to “operationalize data.” A fourth ex-employee dubbed Foundry a “super-charged filing cabinet.” While all of these descriptions are technically accurate, they could also apply to products from hundreds of other tech companies. So what sets Palantir apart? Part of the answer may lie in Palantir’s marketing strategy. Pinto says he believes that the company, which recently began using the tagline “software that dominates,” has cultivated its mysterious public image on purpose. Unlike consumer-facing startups that need to clearly explain their products to everyday users, Palantir’s main audience is sprawling government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. What it’s ultimately selling them is not just software, but the idea of a seamless, almost magical solution to complex problems. To do that, Palantir often uses the language and aesthetics of warfare, painting itself as a powerful, quasi-military intelligence partner. “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world,” Palantir CEO Alexander Karp says in a February 2025 earnings call, “And when it’s necessary, to scare enemies, and on occasion, kill them.”… Underneath the jargon and marketing, Palantir sells tools that its customers—corporations, nonprofits, government agencies—use to sort through data. What makes Palantir different from other tech companies is the scale and scope of its products. Its pitch to potential customers is that they can buy one system and use it to replace perhaps a dozen other dashboards and programs, according to a 2022 analysis of Palantir’s offerings published by blogger and data engineer Ben Rogojan. Crucially, Palantir doesn’t reorganize a company’s bins and pipes, so to speak, meaning it doesn’t change how data is collected or how it moves through the guts of an organization. Instead, its software sits on top of a customer’s messy systems and allows them to integrate and analyze data without needing to fix the underlying architecture. In some ways, it’s a technical band-aid. In theory, this makes Palantir particularly well suited for government agencies that may use state-of-the-art software cobbled together with programming languages dating back to the 1960s. Palantir began gaining steam in the 2010s, a decade when corporate business discourse was dominated by the rise of “Big Data.” Hundreds of tech startups popped up promising to disrupt the market by leveraging information that was now readily available thanks to smartphones and internet-connected sensors, including everything from global shipping patterns to the social media habits of college students. The hype around Big Data put pressure on companies, especially legacy brands without sophisticated technical know-how, to upgrade their software, or else risk looking like dinosaurs to their customers and investors… Palantir’s software is designed with nontechnical users in mind. Rather than relying on specialized technical teams to parse and analyze data, Palantir allows people across an organization to get insights, sometimes without writing a single line of code. All they need to do is log into one of Palantir’s two primary platforms: Foundry, for commercial users, or Gotham, for law enforcement and government users. Foundry focuses on helping businesses use data to do things like manage inventory, monitor factory lines, and track orders. Gotham, meanwhile, is an investigative tool specifically for police and government clients, designed to connect people, places, and events of interest to law enforcement. There’s also Apollo, which is like a control panel for shipping automatic software updates to Foundry or Gotham, and the Artificial Intelligence Platform, a suite of AI-powered tools that can be integrated into Gotham or Foundry. Foundry and Gotham are similar: Both ingest data and give people a neat platform to work with it. The main difference between them is what data they’re ingesting. Gotham takes any data that government or law enforcement customers may have, including things like crime reports, booking logs, or information they collected by subpoenaing a social media company. Gotham then extracts every person, place, and detail that might be relevant. Customers need to already have the data they want to work with—Palantir itself does not provide any. A former Palantir staffer who has used Gotham says that, in just minutes, a law enforcement official or government analyst can map out who may be in a person’s network and see documents that link them together. They can also centralize everything an agency knows about a person in one place, including their eye color from their driver’s license, or their license plate from a traffic ticket—making it easy to build a detailed intelligence report. They can also use Gotham to search for a person based on a characteristic, like their immigration status, what state they live in, or whether they have tattoos… In some ways, Palantir can be seen as an amplifier of people’s intentions and biases. It helps them make evermore precise and intentional decisions, for better or for worse. But this may not always be obvious to Palantir’s users. They may only experience a sophisticated platform, sold to them using the vocabulary of warfare and hegemony. It may feel as if objective conclusions are flowing naturally from the data. When Gotham users connect disparate pieces of information about a person, it could seem like they are reading their whole life story, rather than just a slice of it. “It’s a really powerful tool,” says one former Palantir employee. “And when it’s in the wrong hands, it can be really dangerous. And I think people should be really scared about it.” ****** I quite enjoyed the Economist's article on Palantir: "Palantir might be the most overvalued firm of all time What would make it worth buying?" So sad to see the bubble bursting at bit. So very sad. www.economist.com/finance-and-… [image or embed] — notsewmot.bsky.social (@notsewmot.bsky.social) August 20, 2025 at 6:34 PM The Economist asks, “What Would Make It Worth Buying?” … No one can accuse Palantir, a data-analysis outfit and the most searingly hot stock of 2025, of unspectacular growth. It reported revenue of $1bn for the second quarter of this year, 48% higher than for the second quarter of 2024 and quadruple the figure for the same period in 2020. Silicon Valley types seek out companies satisfying the “rule of 40”, meaning that the sum of their operating margin and year-on-year sales growth, both expressed in percentage points, is higher than 40. Palantir’s score on that measure is 94: higher than any other enterprise-software firm with equivalent or greater sales. Among the world’s 25 biggest companies by market value—of which Palantir is one—only Nvidia, with its near-monopoly on artificial-intelligence chips, scores higher. Any investor would want a piece of that. The trouble is that Palantir’s market value has already soared to $430bn (see chart 1), more than 600 times its past year’s earnings and nearly triple the equivalent multiple for Cisco (or, indeed, Nvidia) at its peak. Software firms often prefer to express their valuation in terms of underlying sales, which puts Palantir’s multiple at around 120. For comparison, in 2005, the year before the Oxford English Dictionary added the verb “Google”, Google’s price-to-sales ratio peaked at 22. You need not look far to explain why Adam Parker of Trivariate Research, an investment firm, has published a note entitled “Could Palantir be the best short idea?” Writing in late May, he examined the ratio of enterprise value (which adjusts market value to account for debt and cash on the balance-sheet) to forecast sales for the coming year. On this measure Palantir then scored 73 and now scores 104. Mr Parker looked for other listed companies that had hit a multiple of 70 since 2000. Excluding financial firms and those with annual revenue of less than $50m, he found 14, the largest of which has a market value around a quarter of Palantir’s. That was Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a firm that sells some software but pitches itself to investors as a “bitcoin treasury company”, with a value derived from its cryptocurrency holdings rather than its sales… What, then, would it take to make Palantir’s shares worth buying? The firm helps everyone from spooks to fast-food chains analyse their data better and thereby improve their operations. Its blistering recent growth comes, in large part, from enthusiasm over adopting AI for such purposes. Palantir’s competitive advantage derives not just from its software and clever engineers, but from a high-level security clearance allowing it to process classified information from America’s defence and intelligence agencies. This gives it a “moat” with which to fend off competitors… Sustained revenue growth of that magnitude or more is possible, even at Palantir’s scale: Google (now called Alphabet), Meta and Nvidia have all managed it. Yet none was priced to do so in advance—and they are, after all, among the most successful firms in history. On a call with analysts and investors after announcing Palantir’s most recent results, Alex Karp, the chief executive (pictured), admitted that “this is a once in a generation, truly anomalous quarter.” The remarkable thing is that shareholders need the company’s revenue to continue to grow at a similar rate just to have a good chance of breaking even. There is no allowance for an upstart competitor, a scandal that makes clients wary or even a mere slowdown. If any of those strike, Cisco will need to make way for a new cautionary tale. Once we turf out the current batch of malefactors, could an honest administration pull Palantir’s vaunted security clearance, possibly while Peter Thiel stands before a Truth & Reconciliation Commission? ****** Fairness requirement: Strenuous argument against Palantir’s whole existence: Palantir: the world’s most evil company open.substack.com/pub/politica… [image or embed] — Ck (@ck-100.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 6:40 PM Filter No commenters available.

Carlo Graziani August 25, 2025 at 7:28 pm There’s also Apollo, which is like a control panel for shipping automatic software updates to Foundry or Gotham… …which makes it sound like the highest-value nation-state cyberattack target in the observable universe. Get into Apollo, and you can covertly push malware into the data analytics software of securocracies and tech companies in the US and abroad. I sincerely hope they take their security very seriously. Dorothy A. Winsor August 25, 2025 at 7:35 pm I saw the headline and thought “the palantir is a communication device.” But no. Wrong universe. Martin August 25, 2025 at 7:54 pm @Old School: Hard to tell without more details. But Palantir basically specializes in recognizing a companies technical debt, and rather than helping a company solve it, just layer a new system on top that uses AI, etc. to try and replicate what your system ought to be doing, but in a different way. For instance in my career I was fairly notorious for building tools that could solve problems that the maintainers of the data couldn’t do. Their systems were collect information on students, or research expenditures, or payroll, etc but the tools weren’t designed to give broad insights on what was happening in those areas. They were useful for tracking A student, or A grant, or AN employee, but not seeing larger patterns. One way to solve that problem is to rework your tools so they are capable of doing that, but these tools are generally designed to enforce processes, and as such they are the laws of your organization in code, and reworking them can be very expensive, because any departures from how they worked before are effectively rewriting the laws of your organization. When I wasn’t part of the group responsible for the tool, but was tasked with providing the insight, rewriting the tools wasn’t an option – I didn’t own that system. Instead, I’d scrape that system in one way or another – pull from their dataset if I could get that permission, but as a last resort simply build a tool that emulated an employee accessing their tool and just scrape records from their UI. And from their data build a new tool that was designed to give the insight we needed – focusing on groups of students, demographics, categories of research or faculty, etc. You don’t need to rewrite the tool this way. It’s a way for an organization to neglect their technical debt a while longer but also can help an organization see the need to abstract their policy enforcement through code from their data from their code analysis. This is kind of what the microservices design pattern seeks to do as well. It’s not a bad approach, though if you are using it to neglect your technical debt it’s bad. Palantir does two things, from what I understand: Marc August 25, 2025 at 8:32 pm A year or so after 9/11 I was working on code with the PhD students for an “NSF” grant (we used to go to the sponsor’s meetings at the Ft Meade Travelodge) to look at communications flow between teams of workers on massive construction projects (nuclear plants, transit systems, etc.). This involved collecting massive amounts of metadata (no content) associated with email, CAD file updates, project change orders, and milestone completions. With some statistical analysis that could converted into an abstract model of the actual (as opposed to formal) organizational structure that would drive a simulation. Then we’d run the simulation thousands of times using genetic and ML algorithms to determine the “optimal” organizational structures for cost/schedule on future similar projects. Or, you could also figure out whom to remove to ensure that a project would never reach completion. That, among other things, is what Palantir does. JaneE August 26, 2025 at 12:33 am I don’t understand how Palantir could “overhaul antiquated human resources systems” if all it does is extract the old data from the existing antiquated system and give the users tools to generate analyses and give them better access to the old data. It would be a band-aid for the old system to let the users have better data until the system were overhauled. At that point the users would have the choice of whatever the newer system offered or let Palantir hoover up the new data to generate their analyses and reports. How does Palantir add new information if they don’t actually change the old system? I worked on those antiquated systems when they were new. Unless they actually have been updated to the newer languages and database structures getting information out is limited by what can be put in in the first place. If they already have all the data they need and just want to get additional views of the information without the time of programming it this might be a good solution, but that doesn’t sound like what the scrapped project was doing. Even if the Palantir solution is a good fit for what they want(ed) to do, this scrapping 12 years (and who knows how many man-years) of work because they want a specific (well connected politically) company to be given a chance to bid sounds like a totally corrupt deal. They didn’t bid 12 years ago – for whatever reason – so scrapping the current contractor really is nothing but political. Do the procurement regulations allow that type of patronage contracting?

Title: 350,000 Black Women Were Ousted From The Workforce—For Millennials, Where Are They Going Next?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasminebrowley/2025/08/25/350000-black-women-were-ousted-from-the-workforce-for-millennials-where-are-they-going-next/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T22:42:24Z
Full Content:
ByJasmine Browley, Contributor. As I’ve stated time and time again, millennials know how to hustle. From the time we reached our formative years, our identities were melded into our professions. So imagine what happens when our merit is systemically attacked at a government level. When the most recent jobs report revealed that 350,000 Black women had left the labor force, I resisted the instinct to call those exits voluntary. “I personally term that as being ousted,” I told the experts I interviewed, “because a lot of those exits were not optional.” Behind that staggering number are women who are losing not only paychecks but also the stability, health access, and professional pathways that keep families and communities afloat. What happens next for them? Some are rebuilding through entrepreneurship, others are demanding systemic reforms, and all are navigating the intersection of workforce inequity and personal resilience. “Job loss directly translates into reduced income and potentially a loss of health insurance,” explained Fade Adetosoye, who helped lead a recent McKinsey study on Black maternal health and workforce participation. “That makes it harder for women to afford prenatal and postpartum care, medications, and services for conditions like gestational diabetes or hypertension—things that disproportionately impact Black women.” The ripple effects are profound. McKinsey’s research estimates that addressing the Black maternal health gap could add $25 billion to the U.S. economy annually and save $385 billion in healthcare costs. Without intervention, Black mothers lose an average of 14–15 healthy days per year for the rest of their lives due to childbirth-related conditions. “We’re talking 350,000 healthy years lost that women could be spending participating in the economy, investing in their families and communities,” Adetosoye told me. Her conclusion is stark: “The gold standard for birthing people should not be survival. It should be thriving. And there is absolutely a tie between Black maternal health disparities and economic mobility.” For Michelda Castro, the ousting wasn’t theoretical. She had climbed through finance and government program management roles, even overseeing a $69 million loan fund for underserved communities. But repeated experiences with bias, systemic barriers, and finally, layoffs tied to shifting federal priorities, left her searching for something more sustainable. “I was stressed, having panic attacks at work, working 60, 70 hours a week,” she recounted to me. “They told me I was doing a great job, but when the director role opened up—the one I’d been running for nine months—they didn’t even give me an interview. Then they asked me to train the white man they hired instead.” After another corporate stint ended in layoffs due to federal grant cuts handed down by the Trump administration, Castro leaned fully into entrepreneurship. More than a decade ago, she founded Versatile Image, a nonprofit that hosts the Unity Block Party in Utah, an annual cultural and economic festival that now generates over $100,000 in revenue. With the layoff, she focused renewed energy and focus into making the once side hustle into her full-time career. Still, she says the uphill climb is relentless: federal grants have been slashed and are continuing to be so, corporate sponsors have pulled out due to DEI alignment concerns, and banks remain reluctant to extend capital. “If I were a white man, the struggle would be glamorized—like starting Amazon in a garage,” she said. “But when it’s a Black woman, people call it complaining.” The broader context, says Jocelyn Frye, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families and co-leader of the 75 Million Campaign, is that today’s job losses are less about performance and more about politics. “When you lose a job not because of your work but because of a political agenda, it can feel demoralizing,” Frye told me. “And for Black women, particularly Black mothers—more than 80% of whom are the primary breadwinners—it threatens the stability of entire families.” She points to the rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as both a cause and a consequence. “This administration has deployed a different narrative, but the purpose is the same as always: to erode the pathways that allowed Black women even a chance at the middle class,” Frye told me. Her call to action: don’t internalize the systemic failures. “This is not about individual deficiencies. It’s an ideological agenda. And we must push back—not only to protect jobs, but to protect the progress that got us here in the first place.” Despite the structural barriers, Black women continue to lead in entrepreneurship. According to American Express data, Black women are the fastest-growing demographic of entrepreneurs in the U.S., a trend likely to accelerate as traditional pathways constrict. “I don’t want to just survive pregnancy, or layoffs, or discrimination,” Adetosoye told me. “I want to thrive. And thriving means being able to build wealth, plan estates, and contribute fully to the economy.” Castro echoed the same sentiment, this time through the lens of her community. “When I couldn’t find joy in corporate America, I built it myself. That’s what the Unity Block Party is—it’s our refusal to be erased.” This year, she was sure to lean in on the joy element by tapping headliner Durand Bernard, a popular singer that often weaves messages of self-care in his songs. “I am so excited‚” Castro told me. “We need this happiness more than ever.” The exodus of 350,000 Black women from the labor force is more than a statistic—it’s a referendum on whether the U.S. economy values their contributions. For Adetosoye, Castro, and Frye, the answer is to build new systems: of care, of capital, of narrative. “Black women, especially younger generations, like millennials, are resilient,” Frye said. “But resilience should not be the requirement for survival in this economy. We deserve systems that work for us, not against us.”

Title: Levi & Korsinsky Reminds Shareholders of a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of September 30, 2025 in Novo Nordisk A/S Lawsuit – NVO

Full Content:
August 25, 2025 17:54 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=163051&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients. For seven years in a row, Levi & Korsinsky has ranked in ISS Securities Class Action Services’ Top 50 Report as one of the top securities litigation firms in the United States.

August 25, 2025 17:02 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: 11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Aug. 26, 2025)

Growth in the use of ETFs and SMAs is changing how muni portfolios are constructed, reports Bond Buyer. Morningstar gives investors a closer look at potential pitfalls of using funds of funds. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. August 25, 2025 ETF and SMA Growth Is Reshaping How Muni Portfolios Are Built and Managed “At The Bond Buyer's Buy-Side Summit, panelists from BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Invesco, and BAM Mutual explore how demand for customization, transparency, and active strategies is transforming the muni fund landscape.” (Bond Buyer) Funds of Private Funds for the Masses? What Investors Need to Know About the SEC’s Latest Guidance “Secondary managers have a habit of buying these funds at discounts to their net asset values and then immediately marking them back up to their NAVs once they own them. This can create illusory returns, as the apparent gains are just on paper and the result of an accounting trick. Secondary managers who do this are essentially pulling future returns into the present by assuming they can at least get the private fund’s NAV if they have to sell it today, even though they may have bought it yesterday at a discount.” (Morningstar) What Barron Capital’s Newest ETFs Say About Interest in Active Investing “Dave Nadig, Nadig.com independent ETF expert, joins CNBC’s Frank Holland on ‘Halftime Report’ to discuss Baron Capital’s entrance into the ETF market and why going active could work for the firm.” (CNBC) Stanger: Private Non-Traded REITs Outraise Publicly Traded Counterparts by 45% “Private non-traded real estate investment trusts outraised their publicly registered non-traded counterparts by over 45% to start the year, attracting over $4.2 billion of investor capital compared to $2.9 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2025. This is according to the latest analysis by Robert A. Stanger & Company Inc., an investment banking firm and leader in alternative investment industry research. In Q2 2025, private non-traded REITs grew their aggregate net asset value to $24 billion, a 10.5% quarter-over-quarter increase, further cementing their expanding share of the non-traded REIT market.” (AltsWire) It’s Not Too Early to Look at Tax-Exempt Bond ETFs “Fall is just around the corner, and with it comes the start of portfolio preparation for the end of the year. For many investors and advisors, that means adding investments that can help reduce the tax bill from portfolios. Tax exempt bond ETFs in particular can provide a powerful tool in meeting that goal. Leaning on the ETF wrapper, those funds may be worth adding now amid continued interest rate uncertainty.” (VettaFi) Fintech Upstarts Are Powering a Boom—and Ecosystem—for Private Markets “Sophisticated platforms—typically catering to private-wealth advisers—aim to ease their clients’ ownership and management of assets in private credit, real estate, private equity and other alternative investments that, until recently, were reserved for institutional investors and the super-wealthy. New software tools, digital tokenization and AI are being put to work to remove longstanding pain points in everything from making products discoverable to executing transactions, managing ownership stakes and educating advisers and their clients.” (PitchBook) Beleaguered Private Investment B-D Draws More Regulatory Scrutiny “Linqto Capital, a private stock investment platform that last month filed for bankruptcy protection after drawing scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.” (Financial Advisor IQ) The Democratization of Private Equity Could Create a “Systemic Risk Machine” “Private equity’s success depends on patient, locked-up capital insulated from the mood swings of public markets. Retail flows bring the opposite: liquidity demands, shorter investment horizons, and a political reflex for heavier oversight. Regulatory tripwires abound: Once retirement-plan investments exceed 25 percent of a fund’s assets, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) rules apply, dragging in the kind of compliance costs and fiduciary constraints that sap agility.” (Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research) Yieldstreet’s Real Estate Struggles Could Shake Fractional Ownership Market “Yieldstreet, a once-heralded platform promising to democratize access to private real estate, recently disclosed steep losses and defaults in a large swath of its real estate deals. The ripple effects of these bad investments extended beyond its investor base. A recent review of 30 real-estate offerings revealed that four deals ended in total loss and another 23 are on watchlists and have triggered approximately $78 million in defaults in just the past year.” (Propmodo) This Classic Investment Strategy Is Still Alive in 2025 “The merit of a classic portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has been a matter of debate in recent years. A diversified 60/40 strategy failed to protect investors in 2022’s broad market crash—in fact, an all-stock portfolio would have held up better. However, a historical deep dive from Morningstar concluded that the tried-and-true approach lessened the pain in almost all of the worst market crashes in 150 years better than an all-stock portfolio. Morningstar Inc Portfolio Strategist Amy Arnott discusses the 60/40 portfolio’s ups and downs and its performance in 2025.” (Morningstar) Thoma Bravo Secures Leeway from Backers to Hand Slice of PE Deals to Other Investors “US software-focused private equity group negotiated broad carve-out in recent funds’ terms.” (Financial Times) Related:FTSE Russell: In a Volatile Year, Investors Remain Happy with Their Advisors Elaine Misonzhnik Senior Editor, Investments, WealthManagement.com Elaine Misonzhnik is Senior Editor, Investments at WealthManagement.com, focusing on alternative investments.

Title: Nvidia Stock May See Its Biggest Post-Earnings Move in a Year This Week

Artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) is slated to report quarterly results after markets close later today, with traders prepared for a big stock move. Nvidia's stock is expected to move approximately 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to options pricing data. That big of a move from Tuesday's close would put shares at either $192.88, an all-time high that translates to a $4.7 trillion market capitalization, or $170.66, its lowest price since mid-July. Nvidia has reported earnings 10 times since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked the AI craze that’s made it the world’s most valuable company. The stock posted double-digit gains in the days after four of those reports, most recently in May 2024. But Nvidia’s earnings have struggled recently to clear the exceptionally high bar set by Wall Street. In the past four quarters, Nvidia stock has moved an average of 3.2% between reporting earnings and the end of the week. On only one of those occasions—the most recent report in May—did Nvidia finish the week above where it was before reporting earnings. Investors will be scrutinizing Nvidia’s report Wednesday for confirmation that AI demand remains strong. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) all recently stood by plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year on data center infrastructure and other capital goods, citing robust demand for AI and cloud computing. Nvidia, with an estimated 80% to 90% share of the AI chip market, should be the biggest beneficiary of that spending. Wall Street will also be hoping for updates on sales to China. Nvidia warned in May that the Trump administration’s decision to tighten China export controls could cost it up to $8 billion in the second quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) struck a deal with the Trump administration that allows them to resume sales of key AI chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut. That deal came too late to have any impact on Wednesday’s results, but it should be factored into Nvidia’s guidance. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia. Of the 14 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current ratings on Nvidia’s stock, 13 rate it a “buy” and one gives it a neutral “hold” rating. Their targets range from $155 to $225, with the majority above $200. The stock was little changed near $182 in early trading Wednesday ahead of the results. UPDATE—Aug. 27, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest options and share prices.

Nvidia, with an estimated 80% to 90% share of the AI chip market, should be the biggest beneficiary of that spending. Wall Street will also be hoping for updates on sales to China. Nvidia warned in May that the Trump administration’s decision to tighten China export controls could cost it up to $8 billion in the second quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) struck a deal with the Trump administration that allows them to resume sales of key AI chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut. That deal came too late to have any impact on Wednesday’s results, but it should be factored into Nvidia’s guidance. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia. Of the 14 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current ratings on Nvidia’s stock, 13 rate it a “buy” and one gives it a neutral “hold” rating. Their targets range from $155 to $225, with the majority above $200. The stock was little changed near $182 in early trading Wednesday ahead of the results. UPDATE—Aug. 27, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest options and share prices.

Title: Nvidia Stock May See Its Biggest Post-Earnings Move in a Year This Week

Artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) is slated to report quarterly results after markets close later today, with traders prepared for a big stock move. Nvidia's stock is expected to move approximately 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to options pricing data. That big of a move from Tuesday's close would put shares at either $192.88, an all-time high that translates to a $4.7 trillion market capitalization, or $170.66, its lowest price since mid-July. Nvidia has reported earnings 10 times since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked the AI craze that’s made it the world’s most valuable company. The stock posted double-digit gains in the days after four of those reports, most recently in May 2024. But Nvidia’s earnings have struggled recently to clear the exceptionally high bar set by Wall Street. In the past four quarters, Nvidia stock has moved an average of 3.2% between reporting earnings and the end of the week. On only one of those occasions—the most recent report in May—did Nvidia finish the week above where it was before reporting earnings. Investors will be scrutinizing Nvidia’s report Wednesday for confirmation that AI demand remains strong.

ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle

A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk significantly lowered its sales outlook for 2025. The Company attributed the reduction to “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” On this news, Novo Nordisk’s American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) price fell $15.06 per ADR, or 21.83%, to close at $53.94 per ADR on July 29, 2025.

August 25, 2025 10:14 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: CrowdStrike: Buy Or Sell CRWD Stock Ahead of Its Upcoming Earnings?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), a cybersecurity firm, is slated to release earnings on Wednesday, August 27, 2025. For event-driven traders, reviewing how the stock has behaved around prior earnings announcements can offer useful perspective. Over the past five years, CrowdStrike’s one-day move after earnings has been evenly split between gains and losses. In 50% of instances, the stock posted a positive one-day return with a median gain of 9.8%. In the remaining 50%, it recorded a negative one-day return with a median decline of -5.6%. Although the actual results and management guidance typically drive the largest moves, these historical tendencies can still inform positioning. Given the equal split between positive and negative one-day outcomes, trading solely on the event is challenging. Traders might weigh two broad approaches: While earnings can introduce volatility, the longer-term picture has favored investors: since early January 2021, CrowdStrike has advanced about 100%, rising from roughly $210 to $420, far outpacing the S&P 500’s approximately 70% increase over the same span. Analysts currently expect earnings of $0.83 per share on revenue of $1.15 billion for the latest quarter, versus $1.04 per share on revenue of $964 million a year ago. From a fundamentals angle, CrowdStrike’s market capitalization stands at $104 billion. Over the last twelve months, the company generated $4.1 billion in revenue but was not operationally profitable, with operating losses of $252 million and a net loss of $172 million. That being said, if you prefer upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 91% since inception.

See earnings reaction history of all stocks Some observations on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively lower-risk tactic (though not helpful if correlations are weak) is to study relationships between short-term and medium-term moves after earnings, identify the pair with the highest correlation, and trade accordingly. For example, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest link, a trader could lean “long” for the following 5 days when the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data using a 5-year history and a more recent 3-year window. Here, 1D_5D denotes the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. At times, peer outcomes can influence post-earnings reactions—sometimes even before the report as expectations get priced in. The chart below compares CrowdStrike’s past post-earnings one-day (1D) returns with peers that reported just ahead of CrowdStrike. Peer returns also reflect post-earnings 1D moves for a fair comparison. Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), to produce strong returns for investors. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like CrowdStrike, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception.

Title: Forbes Daily: The U.S. Takes Unusual $10 Billion Tech Stake In Intel

Time Published: 2025-08-25T11:56:00Z
Full Content:
ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled long-awaited rate cuts could be coming, the world’s wealthiest became even richer. Powell’s comments at the central bank’s symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming spurred a broader stock market rally, as lower rates are expected to jolt the economy. The world’s richest person, Elon Musk, gained $9.3 billion in net worth, bringing his total to around $417 billion on Friday, while the second-wealthiest, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, got a $4.4 billion boost. President Donald Trump has demanded a rate cut, but Powell warned that despite U.S. economic resilience, tariffs could “spur a more lasting inflation dynamic.” In an unusual move for the federal government, President Donald Trump said the U.S. will take a 10% stake in Intel worth roughly $10 billion, making it the third-largest shareholder in the struggling chipmaker. It’s one of the largest government interventions in an American company in more than a decade, when the U.S. injected billions of funds into automakers during the 2008 financial crisis. Judges in two courts have now found that the president of the United States took part in a yearslong fraud that deceived financial institutions about his net worth, but they differed on how much Trump should pay as a penalty. Last week, appellate justice Peter Moulton reduced Trump’s roughly $500 million penalty imposed by a judge in February to zero. Neither did much math to arrive at those numbers. MORE: The wiping out of Trump’s fine was also a win for billionaire Don Hankey, whose specialty insurance firm put up a $175 million bond for Trump last year while he was appealing the ruling. While Trump and Hankey had never met or directly done deals, Hankey, worth $7.8 billion, confirmed to Forbes last year that he supported Trump’s political campaigns and was the largest individual owner of the lender that refinanced mortgages for some of Trump’s properties. Most people invest in an index fund to diversify their portfolio—but when it comes to the benchmark S&P 500 these days, 28% of the value of the index is in just five stocks: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta, all of which have high price tags. To take a step back from the S&P 500, investors can instead purchase a total market fund, blend U.S. and foreign stocks, purchase bonds or consider ETFs that hold small- and mid-cap stocks. President Donald Trump said he would fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she doesn’t resign, as a Trump Administration official has accused her of mortgage fraud. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte alleges Cook claimed two properties as her primary residence, but Cook has denied wrongdoing and said the mortgage application was from before she joined the Fed. The billionaire owner of OnlyFans is now worth $7.8 billion, double Forbes’ estimate from a year ago, as he earned more than $1.9 million a day from the site in 2024. And Leonid Radvinsky may be in for his biggest payout yet, as he is reportedly in talks to sell OnlyFans in a deal that would value the company at about $8 billion. President Donald Trump suggested he could again delay the deadline for TikTok to secure a U.S. buyer or face a ban. Trump called the national security concerns over the app owned by Chinese company ByteDance “highly overrated,” and suggested there are buyers lined up for TikTok. MORE: Even as TikTok continues to face the threat of a ban in the U.S., its business is growing elsewhere in the world. Outside the U.S., TikTok saw its revenues surge 38% to $6.3 billion last year, though it’s facing a litany of lawsuits and investigations from regulators globally. The theme park industry, like the broader travel sector, is on a bit of a roller coaster ride this year: Data shows that overall spending at U.S. theme parks was down 5% this summer compared to last year, mostly driven by a pullback from low- and middle-income parkgoers. Meanwhile, pricier destination theme parks run by Disney and Universal got a boost from affluent visitors, a trend mirrored in the rest of the industry. These days, Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, America’s best-known pothead entertainers, are playing by the rules, as long as you ignore the federal laws regarding marijuana. In 2020, the duo, along with their business partners, launched two companies, California-based Cheech and Chong Cannabis Co., which licenses its brand, genetics, formulas and retail designs to marijuana companies, and Cheech and Chong’s Global Holding Company, a Nevada-based endeavor that sells hemp-derived products ranging from gummies to THC-infused drinks. In 2025, the companies’ combined revenue will hit nearly $100 million from both marijuana and hemp, up from about $50 million last year. The companies, which outsource manufacturing to third parties, are worth roughly $150 million. And as the U.S. cannabis market posted $32 billion in sales last year across 40 states, Cheech and Chong, if anybody, deserve a taste of the action. The pair are the godfathers of the stoner comedy genre thanks to Up In Smoke, their 1978 debut film followed by Nice Dreams and other movies, all of which influenced generations of films from Dave Chappelle’s Half Baked to Seth Rogen’s Pineapple Express. Celebrity cannabis brands do not typically do well, other than a few exceptions such as Mike Tyson’s Tyson 2.0 and Wiz Khalifa’s Khalifa Kush. But Cheech and Chong have a unique advantage—not only are they synonymous with weed, but they also have a massive fan base that spans generations. WHY IT MATTERS “Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong have been making people laugh for decades, but their cannabis business is no joke,” says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. “With $100 million in combined revenue from their companies that sell marijuana and hemp products, Cheech and Chong are standouts when it comes to celebrity-founded cannabis companies. The duo’s fame and influence spans decades—from their 1978 debut film Up In Smoke to That 70s Show to Zootopia. While most celebrity weed brands flounder on the market, Cheech and Chong have built a strong brand with impressive sales within five years.” MORE The Kings Of CBD Are Now Cooking Up Plans To Make Billion-Dollar Meds From Cannabis And Mushrooms The gap between the earnings of workers and CEOs among the lowest-paying firms on the S&P 500 is growing, according to a report from the progressive think tank Institute for Policy Studies. The report found CEO pay is rising more than twice as quickly as that of the average worker: 12.9%: How much the average CEO-to-worker pay ratio widened between 2019 and 2024 6,666 to 1: Last year’s pay ratio gap at Starbucks, the company with the largest such disparity in the S&P 500 32: The number of billionaires who owe their wealth directly to companies in the Low-Wage 100, the S&P 500 corporations with the lowest median worker pay Gen Z is facing one of the worst job markets in recent history, but if you apply the right strategy to your search, it’s still possible to secure an offer. Branch out beyond jobs related only to your college degree, you might find possibilities you hadn’t considered. Don’t be afraid to pivot, and try to target recession-proof industries. A retail business that previously went bankrupt and closed its stores nationwide is planning a comeback, with 300 new locations in the works. What chain is it? A. Party City B. Bed Bath & Beyond C.

A Change Of Heart Publishers are hopeful that Meta may have changed its tune at least somewhat when it comes to how – or whether – the platform reimburses publishers for content contributed to its LLM models. Following up on an IAB Tech Lab event at which Meta and Google participated alongside publishers, Digiday reports on cautious optimism among pubs that Meta’s recent hiring spree of AI engineering leaders has led to a greater appreciation of the value of original written content. That’s quite a different vibe than Meta was putting out there as recently as last year. Last September, on The Verge’s Decoder podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that “creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content.” Reading between the lines, if creators don’t want to participate in feeding AI models because they’re not being properly compensated, then maybe the AI models will just skip over them. Although, not to be a cynic, that might be a moot point, considering all the data scraping that’s been going on. Also, we’ll believe it when we see it – publicly. “They [Meta] were very clear that their stance on this has changed,” one anonymous publisher tells Digiday. “Even though it may not have outwardly turned into action yet.” Data (Fee) Leak Times are tough for The Trade Desk. Its stock price sank after investors questioned its strategy for competing with walled gardens. Meanwhile, competitors are gunning for their slices of open web advertising and the growing CTV and retail media markets. Now, a document leak has revealed what advertisers pay for targeting data sourced from TTD’s retail media partners, Adweek reports. The document, which was last updated June 15, also includes the minimum ad spend required to create custom audiences or conduct campaign measurement using retailer data. When advertisers use retail media data to target ads, they pay the retailer a percentage of the campaign’s CPM capped at a set amount. For example, targeting with Costco’s data might cost 40% of the CPM, but won’t exceed $4 per 1,000 impressions. It’s unclear whether TTD keeps a portion of the data fees for itself. The hard caps are in place because CPMs are much higher for CTV ad buys than online display campaigns, and retail media data is commonly used for CTV targeting. The leak also sheds light on TTD’s no-longer-exclusive ad tech partnership with Walmart’s DSP, including a $150,000 spending minimum and a 75-cent CPM fee for sales lift measurement. However, Walmart says those are old figures, so it’ll be interesting to see what other DSPs will charge for Walmart’s data. Giving Privacy The Finger Fingerprinting has a bad reputation. But opinions on the controversial tracking strategy seem to be shifting. The IAB Tech Lab is even defending it. Audience fingerprinting identifies and tracks devices or users based on unique digital traits like browser settings and software and hardware configurations, without relying on cookies or device IDs. A fingerprint can include everything from web browser type and version, a device’s operating system, the size of the screen, language settings and many other signals. Platforms combine these data points, none of which alone can specifically identify a person, to create a probabilistic user ID. Critics say fingerprinting threatens user privacy, since people can’t opt out. Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft and others prohibit the practice. But Google, which also once banned fingerprinting, reversed course back in January. And now the IAB Tech Lab is also waving away concerns. At the AdMonsters Sell Side Summit in Nashville last week, Tech Lab CEO Anthony Katsur gave a rundown of the trade org’s recent initiatives, including its new Trusted Server framework. In describing how the server uses first-party data to create synthetic IDs, Katsur acknowledged, but also diminished, criticisms that the framework promotes fingerprinting – perhaps drawing on his tense exchange with Sincera’s Mike O’Sullivan in March. “Oh, it’s fingerprinting,” he said in a mocking tone. “Sure, let’s fucking call it fingerprinting.” You heard the man! But Wait! There’s More! Publishers sing the AI scraping blues and detail their diversification efforts at Sell Side Summit Nashville.

August 24, 2025 23:54 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “This is our 17th weekly update. Many of you have asked whether our “Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge” eco-strategy could lead to distraction or drift. In fact, it is the opposite. This is not about losing focus, but about strengthening our foundation. Automaking is a long-cycle, high-investment, and slow-return industry. One of the core challenges FF is facing is that: before hitting positive operating cash flow, how do promote long-term and stable capital supply. Our C10 Treasury is designed for this. By accumulating and compounding the world’s Top 10 crypto coin portfolio, it has the potential to provide continuous and sustained capital support for our main business — EAI EV, truly delivering dual-engine growth from both capital and industry.” On Friday last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that a rate cut may come as early as September. His remarks gave a major boost to capital markets. U.S. equities moved higher, while crypto reacted faster and stronger. The market priced in liquidity easing more directly, creating a clear upside for our C10 Treasury, as the C10 Index was up nearly 6% on Friday. This week, both flywheels achieved important progress: On S1 User Ecosystem: The influence of our “Dual Flywheel + Dual Bridge” unveiling event continues to grow in the U.S. It has sparked meta-chemistry. Cross-sector outreach in automotive, finance, and Web3 created a multi-domain resonance. As a result, FF and FX received cross-industry attention that far exceeded expectations. We will double our efforts to quickly elevate FF and FX’s influence in the U.S. market to another level. Looking at S2–S3: Product & Technology:This week, FX Super One successfully completed the first round of development tests for occupant upper interior impact protection under U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). FMVSS is recognized as one of the world’s most complete and rigorous automotive safety regulations. It is a prerequisite for entering the U.S. market and also sets standards for automotive design, manufacturing, and testing worldwide. FX Super One must meet the requirements of the U.S., the Middle East, and future global markets. This requires testing at the highest standards. We will continue advancing vehicle testing, development, and validation to build a strong foundation for Super One’s high safety standards. Moving on to S4, Product Execution & Delivery: This week, we visited the Hanford manufacturing facility to oversee FX Super One’s trial production. Thanks to the hard work of our manufacturing team, around 60% of the trial production process planning has already been completed. Next, the team will continue comprehensive validation of production processes, refine work procedures, establish and enhance the quality control system, and carry out dedicated skill training in parallel. Lastly, on S5 Capital Markets and finance:The first dedicated $30 million financing commitment for C10 Treasury closed this week. We expect to begin the first round of asset allocation next week. Our plan is to gradually deploy the full $30 million over the coming weeks. 80% will be allocated passively according to the C10 Index, while 20% will be actively managed. We will share portfolio holdings and performance updates in future weekly reports. C10 Treasury, as a short-cycle, fast-paced, high-value, and cash-cow investment due to steady staking interests, could serve as the financial engine of the entire listed company FFAI, and help accelerate the implementation and execution of the EAI EV strategy. Next week:Our Super One co-creation and sales campaign will officially kick off across eight U.S. states. Over the next weekend, I will make a short trip to the Nevada desert, bringing FX Super One to Burning Man. We also plan to announce an important update there. Burning Man has become a global utopia where leading minds in technology, art, and business pursue creativity and idealism. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are regulars there, and Google’s founders once recruited Eric Schmidt at Burning Man. Schmidt went on to lead Google for a decade, driving its rapid expansion and cementing Google’s dominance in the Web2 era. Starting August 28, Super One will also make its debut in Massachusetts, where we and our FF Par partners will host two consecutive co-creation and sales events in the Boston area. At the same time, our New York–based B2B partner Alps will launch a week-long roadshow campaign. On August 30, FF headquarters will host a special event — the inaugural North America “Go-Global Stand-Up Comedy Festival” and FX Super One Showcase. Joe Wong, the first Chinese stand-up comedian to have roasted a U.S. president live at the White House, will join entrepreneurs, founders, and global expansion pioneers for co-creation and exchange. We will see you next week!” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24 points, or 0.05%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.05%, and Nasdaq futures added 0.06%. On Friday, the Dow hit a new all-time high, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed in on their records. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was flat at 4.256% after diving Friday on rate-cut expectations. The U.S. dollar was down 0.02% against the euro and flat against the yen. Gold fell 0.13% to $3,413.80 per ounce. U.S. oil prices rose 0.2% to $63.79 per barrel, and Brent crude added 0.15% to reach $67.83. Friday’s stock surge came after a big selloff that was led by tech giants, as doubts have grown about the AI boom and how much it will actually help companies. That’s after a recent report from MIT found that 95% of AI pilot programs at businesses are failing to produce much of a return. Adding to those concerns were remarks from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who drew a parallel between today’s AI frenzy and the 1990s dotcom bubble. Wall Street’s faith in the staying power of AI as an investment thesis will be put to the test when Nvidia reports quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday. The report also comes after Nvidia and AMD agreed to an unprecedented deal where they give the federal government a 15% cut of their chip sales to China. For now, demand from U.S. companies remains high as so-called hyperscaler tech giants Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms alone are expected to deploy $400 billion in capital expenditures this year, and most of that is going to AI. On Friday, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is due as policymakers wait and see how much of an effect on inflation President Donald Trump’s tariffs are having. Earlier updates on the consumer price index and the producer price index were mixed, and analysts expect the personal consumption expenditures index for July to rise 0.2% on a monthly basis and 2.6% on a yearly basis, the same annual rate as June. But the core PCE is seen climbing 0.3% on a monthly basis and 2.9% on a yearly basis, accelerating from June’s 2.8% annual rate. Still, some Fed officials, including Powell, have indicated that tariff-related impacts on inflation may be short-term and that more attention should go to the labor market, which has shown signs of weakening. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Business Technology News: What’s In Microsoft Copilot’s GPT-5 Upgrade?

ByGene Marks, Contributor. Here are five things in tech that happened this week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them? As of August 7, GPT-5 – OpenAI’s most advanced AI model – is now integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Studio worldwide. Microsoft posted the announcement detailing the following capabilities: -Copilot now uses GPT-5’s real-time router to select the best model for each prompt –either a fast-response engine for simple tasks or a deep-reasoning engine for complex ones. -Its human-like capability mirrors how people think producing incisive feedback when tasks require it. -Copilot can review a project, provide a summary of what worked and what didn’t, and draft a “lessons learned” document. -Copilot can handle large documents up to 100K tokens. Microsoft said this update is available for users who have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license – availability to all users will roll out in the coming weeks. (Source: Microsoft) OpenAI has absorbed a fair amount of abuse for its rollout of GPT-5 in the past few weeks thanks to bugs and hallucinations. But the company has taken steps to resolve these issues, and like any new version of a software product, I’m confident the new platform will be more reliable in the coming months. Microsoft is already doubling down by incorporating into its Copilot offerings. If your company is using Copilot – be it for productivity or internal development – you’ll pretty much have no choice but to use the GPT-5 platform going forward. AI is reshaping the workforce often at the expense of employees according to CNBC’s report that compiled responses from management at companies like Amazon, PayPal and Microsoft. AI is being used to streamline operations, boost productivity, and reduce labor costs. AI tools are replacing roles in customer service, HR, finance, and software development, especially entry-level and repetitive jobs. PayPal’s AI assistant – for example – is cutting down on customer service calls and live interactions. Rising unemployment numbers in the tech sector have been voiced by young workers whose skills overlap with AI capabilities. Executives often frame layoffs as “restructuring” or “optimization,” though experts say these are often euphemisms for AI-driven cuts. AI is quietly becoming a powerful force behind workforce reductions, even as companies tout its benefits for efficiency and innovation. (Source: CNBC) Ever see an employee typing pool? Telephone switchboard operators? Gas station attendants? Blacksmiths? Technology has always replaced people. This is nothing new. In 2025 big companies are doing this, mainly by employing AI in customer service and software development. Ultimately this technology will make its way into operations, sales, marketing, accounting and right down on to the shop floor. Small businesses will follow. Labor will be disrupted. The smartest employees will lean into this stuff and use it well. Others will find themselves out of a job. I’m sure there will be other opportunities, just like there’s always been. Angus Loten of the Wall Street Journal reported on the surge in CEO impersonation scams fueled by AI. Last year alone, over 105,000 deepfake attacks were reported with losses exceeding $200 million. Cybercriminals are using AI-generated deepfakes – hyper-realistic video and audio – to impersonate CEOs and other executives. These scams typically begin with a phone call or video meeting from a fake executive making urgent requests for money transfers, sensitive data, or access credentials. The deepfakes are shockingly convincing, mimicking real voices, facial expressions, and body language in real time. Scammers train AI models using publicly available content – interviews, webinars, earnings calls – to replicate executives’ speech and appearance. The targets of these sophisticated scams are often lower-level employees with privileged access. (Source: Wall Street Journal) Another day, another security threat…this time from AI. Deepfakes are getting better at fooling people and will continue to be a rising threat. But there are some old school ways to defend against this. For example, always call the person back. Require multiple sign-offs on any cash transaction. Require additional documentation, even if it’s from the boss. Get training and have some common sense. DocuSign is evolving far beyond e-signatures with its new AI-powered Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform, unveiled in August 2025. With IAM, DocuSign now helps users manage the entire agreement lifecycle – from request intake to execution – using AI and automation. The AI can flag risky or non-compliant terms based on company playbooks; suggest edits to align with internal policies; and centralize templates and audit trails for consistency and visibility. DocuSign Iris is an AI engine that selects the best model for tasks like contract review, compliance checks, and identity verification. This shift turns contracts from static documents into dynamic, searchable data assets, helping businesses reduce errors, accelerate deal cycles, and improve compliance. (Source: Computer Weekly) As a user of DocuSign, I need to take the advice that I often give to others: lean into your software platforms and get training. We’re still using this platform like we did five years ago. And yet, here are a bunch of ways that we could be doing things better if we only spent the time to learn them. I’m in for some more training. PCWorld’s August 2025 guide offers a treasure trove of tech gear to supercharge your work-from-home setup – 42 products in total, all tested and recommended by their editorial team.

Title: What To Expect in Markets This Week: Nvidia Earnings, a Key Measure of Inflation, and More

After a sweeping rally for U.S. stocks Friday fueled by rising expectations of an interest rate cut next month, earnings from the world's most valuable company and a key measure of inflation could command the spotlight this week. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has been front-and-center in the AI boom, with surging sales on growing demand for the emerging tech. Investors will likely be watching for updates on its most advanced offerings, as well as its plans to navigate changing trade policies, when the company posts its quarterly results. Investors can also look forward to the latest release of the Federal Reserve's favored measure of inflation, which could influence whether the central bank makes its first interest rate cut of the year in September. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Nvidia’s second-quarter results due Wednesday could show whether the chipmaker continues to set the pace in the AI race, with analysts anticipating another sales record despite some headwinds from China export curbs. Nvidia said in May that it expects to report growing revenue, though it warned of a hit from China export restrictions to the tune of $8 billion. The company could offer more updates on its business in China after making a deal with the Trump administration to share revenue from its AI chip sales there. Nvidia is also considering offering a variety of new products for the Chinese market in advance of government approval. Some other companies set to report this week include chipmaker Marvell Technology (MRVL), Dell (DELL), CrowdStrike (CRWD), cloud provider Snowflake (SNOW), and engineering software maker Autodesk (ADSK), along with several Canadian banks. A fresh update on inflation is set to come Friday, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index for July, after dovish remarks last week from Fed Chair Jerome Powell boosted expectations for a rate cut in September. The June PCE report showed that inflation ticked higher that month, but a similar inflation report released earlier showed price increases in July were lower than some feared. The PCE report is the Fed’s preferred measurement of inflation, giving its reading potentially more impact with central bankers ahead of September's interest rate decision. This week will also bring a pair of consumer surveys, data on the U.S. trade balance, and housing market data, among other things.

Title: What I learned about productivity this year

Full Content:
What I gave up, what I kept, and what's new. PLUS: How I'm using AI Once a summer for the past few years, I've taken a break from the news cycle to share a little about how I use technology to do my job. (Here's last year, and the year before.) Readers often tell me they look forward to posts like these, and so in the spirit of giving you more of what you want, here's what I learned about productivity in the past year. Just like last year, I'll offer a couple recommendations for software tools I've recently started using. (None of these recommendations are sponsored, incidentally.) But in an effort to offer a more complete picture of what it's like for me these days to get things done as a journalist and entrepreneur, I also want to talk about what I'm still doing, what I stopped doing, and why. Let's get into it. In my experience, most people use software tools only begrudgingly, and will go to great lengths to avoid ever having to learn a new one. For some percentage of tech enthusiasts, though, trying out new software is a hobby all unto itself. I count myself among this pathological second group, and will regularly drop everything to try out a new to-do app for no productive reason at all. For that reason, I think, the strongest case I can make for you about which software tools are truly useful involve the ones that I have continued to use for more than a year. With that in mind, I'm happy to say I'm still a more-or-less daily user of two apps I told you about last year. Raycast, a launcher app I began using on my Mac, continues to make navigating my laptop effortless. I simply type ⌘-space and can instantly open an app, perform a calculation, reposition my windows, access my clipboard history, look up a word's definition, and dozens of other things. But my favorite use of Raycast is still asking quick questions of AI (a paid upgrade): without ever leaving the tab I'm on, I can look up a quick fact, jog my memory, or get more context. And yes, I double-check any fact it gives me before putting it in the newsletter. But the amount of time and energy I save in context-switching continues to make Raycast a cherished companion. Raycast came to iOS this year, but in truth, I haven't found much use for it. The better news is that it is soon coming to Windows as well; you can sign up for the waitlist here. Capacities, a personal knowledge management app, continues to be my home base for daily planning, journaling, and lightweight task management. The app offers extensive features for folks who like to have dedicated structures and metadata for keeping track of the books they read, the people they meet, and the places they travel. It also has integrated AI chat, integrations with Todoist and other third-party apps, and a growing library of plug-ins built by its community. I've dabbled with those features, but none have stuck. What brings me back to Capacities is the value I find in taking a few minutes most mornings to write in my journal about work, life, and whatever else is on my mind. This clears my head and makes space for me to make a plan for the day, while also letting me noodle on ideas for the column and the podcast. I still do some lightweight tagging of people, topics, and ideas. But I've also come to trust my memory more; it turns out that my mind returning to a subject over and over again is a much more useful signal to me than seeing that I keep tagging the same idea or subject all over again. Or rather, by the time I'm tagging the same idea over and over in Capacities, it has already occurred to me that it's something to write about. And how hard would have it been to find all those stories I so meticulously added and tagged, anyway? Last year I talked about my experiments with Readwise, which I hoped would become a kind of AI librarian. The idea was that it would become a kind of next-generation Pocket, replacing the now-defunct read-it-later app with something more dynamic. It was especially useful at quickly parsing large PDFs, such as court decisions or NGO reports, allowing me to summarize and find relevant parts of the document much faster than I could do myself. It didn't stick. Like Pocket, Readwise turned out to be less of a read-it-later app than a read-it-never app — a place to save articles, books and other media with the best of intentions, and then never to look at it ever again. Summarizing and navigating through PDFs is now something any chatbot will do for you, and for free. Abandoning Readwise is part of an overall move I am making to collecting less stuff. In the past, it seemed obvious that slurping up every item of remote interest into a single database would eventually reap huge rewards for my intellect. And while I continue to investigate new approaches to that question — see below — on the whole I am trying to do less of it. I experimented with Lazy; I spent the past six months keeping a journal of stories about AI in Tana. The best thing I can say about these experiences is that they made it modestly easier to jog my memory about recent events involving a certain company or topic, thanks to the work I had put into tagging them. But doing so required a lot of manual effort, and for only a modest reward. Last month 404 Media's Jason Koebler wrote something that has haunted me ever since: "Where are the journalists who were formerly middling who are now pumping out incredible articles thanks to efficiencies granted by AI?" Koebler's question came as part of a broadside against feckless media executives betting that artificial intelligence will somehow save their businesses despite all current evidence to the contrary. But he also cast doubt on the idea that AI is transformative even at the individual level. I found myself agreeing with him. Like Koebler, I believe that AI is no kind of business model for journalism; and that any efficiencies that individual reporters are seeing from it are relatively modest. There is nothing that AI now does for me that I could not do myself. That said, there are things that AI does for me that I would now hate to do myself, and hope never to do again. There are also some things it can do better than I can, in most cases because it's simply much faster. Here are some of those things: For what it's worth, my most-used models are GPT-5 thinking (previously o3), and Gemini 2.5 Pro. GPT-5 is my daily workhorse, but I also think Gemini is underrated. (Did you know you can upload an audio file to it and it will create a very good transcription for you, and even clean up the filler words?) I find Claude less useful for the tasks above, but I do use it for personal stuff; it has the highest EQ of today's models. (See my ethics disclosure!) And before anyone asks — I do not use AI to draft columns or even to draft outlines. I started a newsletter because I like to write! Two years ago, I wrote this: This feature actually shipped a few months later. My early experiments with it had not gone well. But after interviewing Notion CEO Ivan Zhao for Decoder this month, I gave it another shot. And I'm happy to say that Notion delivered exactly what I was looking for in 2023: the ability to talk to the giant database of links I have stored in it over the past five years, grounded in the actual links and article text I have saved. I can give Notion a sprawling question like "how did the Cambridge Analytica case resolve" and get a good summary of regulatory actions across several years and countries. And by default, web search is off, meaning I know that its AI systems are drawing only on the vetted journalism that I have saved into my database. This is a dream come true. I finally have a meaningful way to sift through millions of words of article text, ask follow-up questions, and get citations that I can use in my work. Notion may yet prove to be the AI librarian that Readwise never became. One more thing I'm trying: I mentioned above that I continue to experiment with different ways to save material that might be useful later. Recently a Reddit post turned me on to Recall, which positions itself as a "self-organizing knowledge base." Currently available as a web and mobile app, Recall lets you save web pages, YouTube videos, PDFs, podcasts, Google Docs, and other materials into a single database that it then organizes on your behalf. Recall is largely redundant to Notion. But I love its interface, its speed, and its overall user experience. Lately, the CEOs I cover have all started doing two- to three-hour podcast recordings. With Recall, I can save the podcast with one click, have it instantly generate a summarized transcript with timestamps, and let the app automatically connect it to other relevant articles and podcasts in my database. It performs similarly well with PDFs of books, which I rarely have the time to read in their entirety, but can now skim using Recall's detailed summaries and decide whether I want to dig in deeper. Recall aims itself in part at students — it will also generate quizzes for you based on the material you save. And like basically every other productivity app today, it also has integrated AI chat, so you can ask questions about long documents and get grounded answers. I haven't been using Recall for long, but for the moment it is scratching my web-hoarding itch unlike anything else has quite been able to do to date. If I've learned one bitter lesson about this stuff over the years, it's that the best productivity hack in the world is simply liking your job. If you enjoy what you do, you will find ways to do it, and in 2025 almost any software remotely suited to the purpose will be more than good enough. On a fundamental level, every single to-do list app is exactly the same. But it's fun to try new things. And while I continue to waste countless hours and a fair bit of money doing so, I also feel like this pursuit keeps me connected to the state of the art. The Notion workspace I dreamed of two years ago is now here at my fingertips. The looming question, as ever, is what I will do with it. On the podcast this week: Kevin and I explore what it means that we're in an AI bubble. Then, Reuters' Jeff Horwitz stops by to discuss his blockbuster story about Meta's policy to let its chatbot engage in "sensual" roleplay with children. And finally, I introduce Kevin to the wild world of "shock slop" — AI-generated songs meant to freak out your parents.

Title: The High Cost Of Ditching DEI: What Target’s Boycott Fallout Reveals
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2025/08/23/the-high-cost-of-ditching-dei-what-targets-boycott-fallout-reveals/

ByJanice Gassam Asare, Ph.D., Senior Contributor. It was recently announced that Target’s CEO of 11 years, Brian Cornell, would be stepping down and Michael Fiddelke, 20-year Target veteran and the Chief Operating Officer, would be stepping in to replace him. Target’s stock has seen a considerable decline since the start of 2025. While some have attributed the company’s decline to Trump’s tariffs and the weakening economy, the company’s about-face when it came to DEI sparked backlash and criticism, leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many consumers. In February of 2025, prominent Atlanta pastor Dr. Jamal Bryant called for a boycott of Target in response to the company’s rollback of their DEI initiatives. The boycott, Bryant indicated, has been the most successful Black boycott since the Montgomery Bus Boycott that occurred 70 years ago. DEI is currently the nation’s favorite bogeyman; being blamed for everything from bridge collapses to plane crashes. There is still a lack of understanding regarding what DEI is, how it can positively impact employees and how it can benefit workplaces, contributing to some of the DEI pushback that has increased in recent months. Make no mistake; DEI is far from perfect, but the existence of workplace DEI programs often provides a pathway to address harm that takes place in the workplace. Many Black consumers saw Target’s decision to cut DEI initiatives as a slap in the face. The company was seemingly so outspoken with their support of Black businesses, pledging a $2 billion investment in Black-owned businesses after the murder of George Floyd. Consumers have become much more judicious with their spending, deciding to resist through their wallets. Costco has been an outspoken advocate of DEI, choosing not to flounder under pressure from DEI opponents, and has seen a net increase in sales, which many attribute to their doubling down of DEI. Target drew the public’s ire because unlike many of the companies that announced they were scaling back their DEI efforts in the past year, Target was one of the most ardent supporters of DEI through their racial equity agenda. With Target being headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the company was at ground zero following the tragic murder of George Floyd. The expectation was that their proximity to the tragedy would result in a true commitment to uplift the Black community, but less than five years later, the company reneged on their promises and pledges. In 1969, activist Fred Hampton was instrumental in spearheading the Rainbow Coalition, where different groups of people worked together to address a common issue. What made the coalition so successful is the power in numbers—multiple people working towards a shared goal is an effective way to combat societal ills. During the Montgomery Bus Boycotts, Black folks were able to inspire and mobilize people from outside the Black community to join their cause. What has made the Target boycott so successful has been a similar strategy from the boycott organizers. It hasn’t been only Black consumers who have been boycotting Target. Communities of other historically marginalized and excluded populations (Latinos, poor folks, the LGBTQIA+ community) have also mobilized to support the boycott. Different groups who knew that DEI rollbacks would impact their communities have come together after calls to boycott from leaders like Bryant. There is power in numbers but it’s important to note: when there is a critical mass of people working towards a shared goal, that goal can be accomplished, according to Harvard political scientist Erica Chenoweth. Chenoweth’s research indicated that only 3.5% of a population’s participation is needed to drive change. The question remains whether the hiring of a new CEO will resurrect Target’s image and thus their sales. In a recent CNN interview, Bryant noted that hiring an internal candidate who has been at the company for decades will not change the company’s engrained ideology or their stance on DEI. Contrary to the popular saying, companies that “go woke,” perhaps won’t actually go broke. Companies should learn from Target’s missteps; a commitment to ensuring that all employees are treated equitably and fairly is not a nice-to-have but a need-to-have. Both consumers and employees are watching; if your words don’t align with your actions, there will be a price to pay. Rather than swaying to appease investors, the DEI detractors, or this current administration, the longevity and sustainability of companies will ultimately be decided by how they treat their employees. People are not settling for crumbs—a failure to prioritize the wellbeing of workers will continue to have dire consequences.
